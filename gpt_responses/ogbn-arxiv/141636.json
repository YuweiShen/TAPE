This is a common topic in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as loss minimization and semi-parametric models, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of synthetic and real blur in the experiments suggests that the paper may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
