The authors propose a new algorithm that improves upon the scalability issues of the original algorithm, which involves stochastic optimization (cs.AI) and machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the construction of Markov chains, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and the evaluation metric used is based on the amount of dollars spent, which is a topic in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
