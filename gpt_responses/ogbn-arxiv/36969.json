Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of Transformer-based models, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the trade-offs between positive transfer and capacity dilution, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the performance of high and low resource languages, which is related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of models for natural language processing tasks, which is related to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
