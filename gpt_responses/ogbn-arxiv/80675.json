This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) since the goal is to extract information from documents. Deep learning (cs.DL) is also relevant as the paper employs deep learning algorithms. Natural language processing (cs.CL) could also be a possible sub-category since the paper deals with academic documents. Finally, machine learning (cs.LG) could be another possible sub-category since the paper discusses the benefits of fine-tuning for improving the accuracy of detection models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
