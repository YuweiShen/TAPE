Additionally, the paper deals with convex bodies and polyconvex sets, which are topics commonly studied in the cs.MG (Metric Geometry) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories. The paper also uses entropy bounds for log-concave random variables, which is a topic studied in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
