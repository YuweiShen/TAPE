It could also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves generating captions for images. Additionally, since the paper proposes a pruning method to reduce the size of the model, it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves training a neural network, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
