The use of semi-definite programming and Gaussian partitions also suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of Gaussian stability results. Finally, the use of geometric concepts and optimization techniques suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
