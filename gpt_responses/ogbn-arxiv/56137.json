It also involves the use of deep reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) to train the vehicle. Additionally, it involves control systems (cs.SY) to ensure safety and path tracking. Finally, it may involve computer vision (cs.CV) to detect obstacles and other vehicles on the road."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
