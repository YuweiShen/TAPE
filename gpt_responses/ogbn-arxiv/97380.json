The paper also discusses the use of this algorithm in the training of a Tetris playing controller. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper deals with control problems, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the convergence rate bounds, which makes cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
