The proposed system uses deep neural networks for feature extraction and classification, which is a popular approach in machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). The system also includes a visualization component using deep autoencoder, which can be related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
