The paper proposes a spatiotemporal framework for measuring the age of information (AoI) in large-scale IoT uplink networks, which involves joint temporal and spatial characterization of the system. This work is likely to be classified under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This category deals with the design, analysis, and optimization of networked systems, including IoT networks. The paper's focus on timely message delivery and network stability is highly relevant to this category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This category deals with the mathematical foundations of information and communication. The paper's use of AoI as a measure of information freshness is directly related to this category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This category deals with the modeling, analysis, and control of complex systems, including cyber-physical systems. The paper's focus on joint temporal and spatial characterization of the system is relevant to this category. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): This category deals with the design and analysis of systems involving multiple agents, such as IoT networks. The paper's focus on network performance and location-dependent performance is relevant to this category. \n- cs.PE (Performance): This category deals with"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
