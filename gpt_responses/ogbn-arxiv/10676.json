The approach involves using RGBD images to predict the class of objects being picked up, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The system also involves a controller to learn a mapping from the image to the predicted result, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
