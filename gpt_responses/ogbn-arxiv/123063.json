The use of iterative methods and the issue of noisy data suggest that machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO) may also be relevant sub-categories. The mention of missing data and wrong correspondences suggests that multimedia (cs.MM) may be relevant. Finally, the use of transformations suggests that artificial intelligence (cs.AI) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
