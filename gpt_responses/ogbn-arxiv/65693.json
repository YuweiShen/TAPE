The paper also discusses the use of specification languages and patterns for mission synthesis, verification, and simulation, which are topics related to software engineering (cs.SE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of temporal logic for mission specification, which is a topic related to systems and control (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL).
