This involves dealing with symbol and carrier-phase asynchronies, channel estimation, and implementing XOR mapping on OFDM samples. These topics are all related to information theory (cs.IT), networking (cs.NI), and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the implementation is done on the universal soft radio peripheral (USRP) platform, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
