This fits well within the scope of cs.PL.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the notion of control flow in quantum algorithms, which involves logical reasoning. Additionally, the paper proposes a language with fixpoints, which is related to recursion theory and computability, both of which are topics in cs.LO.\n- cs.QL (Quantum Physics): The paper deals with quantum algorithms and their control flow, which is a topic in quantum computing. This fits well within the scope of cs.QL.\n- cs.TC (Theoretical Computer Science): The paper proposes a new language and discusses its expressiveness, which are both topics in theoretical computer science. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of quantum control flow, which is a theoretical question.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the expressiveness of a new language, which is related to data structures and algorithms. Additionally, the paper proposes a language with lists, which is a common data structure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
