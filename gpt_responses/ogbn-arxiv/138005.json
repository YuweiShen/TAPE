The paper also introduces a modification to the transition relation that associates with any source state and transition label a reachability distribution, which is a topic that falls under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper then shows how this modified model can be used to give semantics to a fully nondeterministic, a fully probabilistic, and a fully stochastic variant of a CSP-like process language, which is a topic that falls under the categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
