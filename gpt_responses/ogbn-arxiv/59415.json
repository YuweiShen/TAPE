This involves the integration of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) sensors and a navigation control algorithm to allow the robot to accurately and autonomously maneuver on the bridge deck to collect visual images and conduct NDE measurements. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a crack detection algorithm to build the deck crack map, which involves computer vision techniques, suggesting that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for data analysis, which suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of nondestructive evaluation techniques such as impact-echo (IE), ultrasonic surface waves (USW), and electrical resistivity (ER) to generate maps of delamination, concrete elastic modulus, and corrosion, respectively, suggesting that the paper may also belong to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the critical concern of the poor condition of many bridges in the U.S., which suggests that it may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category, as ensuring the safety"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
