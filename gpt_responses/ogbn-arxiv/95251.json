The focus is on finding an optimal edge cut with respect to the average weight of the cut, which is a novel approach. This problem is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), social and information networks (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
