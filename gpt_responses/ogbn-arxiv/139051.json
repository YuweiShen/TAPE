This is a problem that arises in various fields, including image processing (cs.CV), signal processing (cs.IT), and computational imaging (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of convex optimization and semidefinite programming, which are common tools in optimization (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the methods to noise, which is a topic that falls under statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
