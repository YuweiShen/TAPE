The paper uses deep learning architectures for this purpose and applies state-of-the-art approaches from video action recognition. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also deals with human-computer interaction (HCI) and multimedia (MM) aspects, which makes cs.HC and cs.MM likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses the contribution of appearance and motion features, which is related to machine learning (LG) and information retrieval (IR) sub-categories. Therefore, cs.LG and cs.IR are also likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
