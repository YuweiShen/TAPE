The use of orthogonal Hermite representation and spatial cross-correlation matrix suggests a system-level analysis, which falls under systems and control (cs.SY). The study of radiation patterns and beamforming is related to antenna arrays and signal processing (cs.MM), while the analysis of out-of-band radiation and reciprocity calibration is related to radio frequency (cs.RF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
