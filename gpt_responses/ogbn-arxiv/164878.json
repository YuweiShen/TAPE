Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of algorithms and symbolic manipulation, which suggests cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as possible sub-categories. The paper also involves formal definitions and logic, which suggests cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) as another possible sub-category.
