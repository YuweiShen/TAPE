This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as image processing and feature extraction, which makes cs.CV the most likely sub-category. The proposed network also involves modeling pairwise and neighboring relations among views, which can be related to graph theory (GR) and artificial intelligence (AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning techniques for feature aggregation and classification can also be related to machine learning (ML) and multimedia (MM) sub-categories. Therefore, the likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.GR, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
