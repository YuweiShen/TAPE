The paper also introduces a novel network architecture, which involves training a Stacked Hourglass network (commonly used for body pose estimation) to process facial images and output occlusion heat maps. This approach involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on various datasets, which involves experimental evaluation techniques commonly studied in the multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
