It also involves the use of neural networks, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The recursive network used in the proposed architecture suggests that it may also be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the experiments conducted on popular datasets suggest that it may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
