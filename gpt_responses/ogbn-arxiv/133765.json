This involves techniques from computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DS), as well as algorithms for computing distances between metric spaces (cs.DM) and approximating them (cs.GR). The paper also discusses applications in data analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
