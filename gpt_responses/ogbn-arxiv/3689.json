The proposed framework aims to improve the accuracy of system failure detection, which is crucial for maintaining the security of financial services. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for predicting system exceptions and failures in a financial software system. The framework consists of three modules, including a key performance indicator (KPI) data prediction module, anomaly identification module, and severity classification module. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper addresses the issue of system failures in financial software systems and proposes a framework to improve the efficiency and accuracy of system failure detection. The proposed framework involves data cleaning, anomaly prediction, and severity classification, which are important aspects of software engineering. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for predicting system exceptions and failures in a financial software system. The framework involves data cleaning, anomaly prediction, and severity classification, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the extraction of rich information from system logs and the design of a hierarchical architecture of alarm classifiers to alleviate the influence of class-imbalance problem. These aspects involve data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
