The paper introduces two new notions of fairness in the Stable Marriage problem and presents efficient algorithms to find stable matchings of these types. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The paper also involves the use of algorithms and optimization techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) likely categories. The paper also involves experiments to compare different types of fair optimal stable matchings, which makes cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a likely category. Finally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques to find stable matchings, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
