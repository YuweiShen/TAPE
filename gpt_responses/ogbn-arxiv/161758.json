The mention of \"strong bounds on the round complexity\" suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of binomial identities and the notion of orderability may also relate to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
