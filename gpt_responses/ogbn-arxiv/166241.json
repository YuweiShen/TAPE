This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the use of oversampling is often studied in the context of communication networks (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of oversampling in image and video processing (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications, which are other potential sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
