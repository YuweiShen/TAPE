The paper also uses neural network models, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also deals with subword representations, which are commonly used in neural machine translation, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with estimating out of vocabulary words, which is a common problem in information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
