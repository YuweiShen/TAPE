Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a weakly supervised framework that uses existing weak labels such as poses and full body masks, which involves machine learning techniques such as iterative refinement. Therefore, the paper is also likely to belong to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and compares it with state-of-the-art methods, which involves evaluation metrics and experimental results. Therefore, the paper is also likely to belong to sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
