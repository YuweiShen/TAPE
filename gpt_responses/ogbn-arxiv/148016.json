The paper also discusses the use of synthetic images for training, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of near-infrared (NIR) images, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on a specific dataset, which is related to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
