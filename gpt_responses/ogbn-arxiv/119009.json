The paper provides a measure for quantifying the performance of different deviator rules and studies the inefficiency of various deviator rules in network formation games and job scheduling games. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Game Theory and Mechanism Design). The paper also involves the study of local deviator rules, which is related to multi-agent systems and distributed computing, making cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves the analysis of social cost and equilibrium, which is related to optimization and decision making, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the study of network formation games, which is related to social networks and graph theory, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
