It also involves tampering with data in a distributed setting, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper uses technical tools from probability theory and information theory, which are relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes attacks that are implemented in polynomial time, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
