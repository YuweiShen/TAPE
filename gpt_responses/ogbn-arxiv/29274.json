This falls under the scope of natural language processing (NLP) and therefore, the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of different kinds of knowledge (lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic) to resolve anaphora problems in machine translation can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, but the evaluation of the proposed approach on unrestricted corpora suggests the possibility of using machine learning for training and testing the system. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The task of anaphora resolution involves identifying and linking different mentions of the same entity, which is similar to the task of entity linking in information retrieval. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper does not mention the use of neural or evolutionary computing techniques, but the evaluation of the proposed approach on large-scale corpora suggests the possibility of using these techniques for improving the performance of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
