It also discusses the use of soft-decision bit-wise decoding and its impact on the spectral efficiencies of the system. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), network infrastructure (cs.NI), optics (cs.OH), photonics (cs.PH), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
