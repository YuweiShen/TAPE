It also involves the use of coding theory (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC) to analyze the performance of these codes. The paper also discusses the privacy-preserving aspect of the codes, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and proofs, which is a common theme in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
