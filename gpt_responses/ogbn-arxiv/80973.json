The combinatorial characterization and recognition algorithm involve graph theory concepts such as biconnected graphs, outerplanar graphs, and chordal graphs, which are also relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM), data structures (cs.DS), and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents results on the specific class of plane outside-obstacle representations, which may be of interest to researchers in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph drawing (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
