It may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category as it deals with mutation operators and their implementation. Additionally, it could be classified under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category as it uses runtime features to detect pseudo-tested methods. Finally, it may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category as it compares the mutation scores produced by different engines."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
