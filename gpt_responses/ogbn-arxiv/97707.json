The proposed Semantic Bottleneck Networks (SBN) aim to improve interpretability of deep learning systems, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of semantic concepts and materials, which are relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
