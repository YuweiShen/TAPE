Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses compression and quantization techniques, which are related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. The paper also discusses resource allocation optimization, which is related to optimization and control theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely category. The paper also discusses potential solutions for fronthaul-constrained CRANs, which is related to distributed computing, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) another likely category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of fronthaul constraints on quality of service, which is related to communication systems, making cs.COMM (Communications) another likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
