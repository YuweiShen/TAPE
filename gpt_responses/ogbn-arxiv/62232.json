The paper also discusses the interpretation of the languages generated by the agents, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper focuses on the communication strategies between agents, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the cost of communication in cooperative-competitive games, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
