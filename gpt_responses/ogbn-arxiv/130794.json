This involves optimizing a variational objective and modeling the latent space with a Mixture of Gaussians. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
