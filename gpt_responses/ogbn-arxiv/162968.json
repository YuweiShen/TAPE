The algorithms presented in the paper involve polynomial-time computations, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The problem of testing equivalence also has connections to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), as it involves pattern recognition and statistical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
