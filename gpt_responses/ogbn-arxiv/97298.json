It is also likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the application scenario is autonomous driving. Additionally, the paper proposes an artful approach to efficiently obtain a coarse cuboid for each predicted 2D box, which involves machine learning techniques such as classification and regression, making it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of visual features and classification formulation with quality aware loss, which are related to Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
