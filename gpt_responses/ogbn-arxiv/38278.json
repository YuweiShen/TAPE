The paper also provides a theoretical framework for these methods, which involves maximizing mutual information, a concept commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also draws inspiration from related methods in computer vision, which suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for transfer learning across multiple domains, which could be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
