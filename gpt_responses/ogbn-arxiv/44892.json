It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as panoramic video is a type of multimedia content. Graphics (cs.GR) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses GPU-based parallel optimization for video stitching. Network and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) is also possible as the paper mentions the requirement for 3D converged video surveillance in smart cities. Finally, Systems and Control (cs.SY) is a possibility as the paper proposes a real-time stitching framework that requires strong processing abilities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
