This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The proposed technique involves the use of multi-antenna transmission and power control, which are also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the impact of finite blocklength, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the optimization of transmission outage probability involves mathematical modeling and analysis, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
