The paper also discusses the issue of key disagreement caused by estimation error, which is a security concern and falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of power allocation and neural networks in improving key generation also involves networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a closed-form expression for key disagreement rate, which involves mathematical analysis and could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
