The paper also introduces a new class of codes called convertible codes, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper presents a framework for formalizing the notion of code conversion and proves tight bounds on the number of nodes accessed during code conversion, which are topics related to systems and control (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of adapting redundancy configurations in response to variations in failure rates, which is a topic related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
