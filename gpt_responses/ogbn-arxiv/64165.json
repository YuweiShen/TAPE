The paper also proposes a novel weakly supervised curriculum learning pipeline, which involves training deep networks in a fully supervised manner (cs.LG). The paper uses multiple solution mechanisms and incorporates metric learning and density-based clustering to filter detected object instances, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
