The paper also discusses the use of VLAD encoding, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper presents experiments and results, which suggests that it may also fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
