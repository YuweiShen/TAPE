The paper also introduces two key features, namely, a multi-armed bandit based adaptive restart (MABR) policy and a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) technique, which involve machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the tool, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.CC, cs.DS, and cs.SE, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
