This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper specifically focuses on the security threats in MANETs and proposes solutions to mitigate them. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the routing protocols used in MANETs and proposes modifications to them to improve their security. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the information exchange and routing mechanisms in MANETs and proposes solutions to secure them. This falls under the domain of information theory. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes modifications to the routing protocols used in MANETs to improve their security.
