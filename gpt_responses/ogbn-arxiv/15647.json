The use of graphical encodings is also a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category is also relevant. The paper also discusses the need for empirical guidelines, which could fall under Information Retrieval (cs.IR) or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on user interaction and design could also be relevant to Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
