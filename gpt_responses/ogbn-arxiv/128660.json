Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning techniques to optimize the decoding process, which suggests a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of learnable parameters and hardware-friendly approaches suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper's focus on improving error-correction performance suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
