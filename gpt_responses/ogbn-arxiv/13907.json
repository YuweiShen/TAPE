This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the development of a big-step evaluation semantics for an ML-like language, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also deals with the proof system and its soundness and completeness, which suggests that it may belong to the Theoretical Computer Science (cs.TL) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of environment classifiers, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computational Logic (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
