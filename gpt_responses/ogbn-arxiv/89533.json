The paper also discusses the limitations of existing defense methods, which can be considered as a contribution to the sub-field of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed defense strategy involves the use of Langevin dynamics, which is a common technique in the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
