It could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the application of this work is relevant to robotics and autonomous vehicles. The paper also involves the use of GPU devices, which could place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques for real-time computation, which could place it in the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
