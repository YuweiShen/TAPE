The method involves using convolutional layers and a new long short-term dependence-aware (LSTD) module to boost the learned features. This paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it deals with image-based pose estimation. It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it involves training a neural network. Additionally, it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as pose estimation is a common task in robotics. It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves developing a method for a specific task. Finally, it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with processing visual information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
