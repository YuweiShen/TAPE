The TARM employs a novel attention learning network to recalibrate the temporal attention of frames in a skeleton sequence, while the STCM treats the attention calibrated skeleton joint sequences as images and leverages the Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to further model the spatial and temporal information of skeleton data. This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as attention learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and machine learning (ML) techniques such as memory networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
