Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The proposed approach involves graph learning, which is a subfield of machine learning, and hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. The paper also involves the use of thermal infrared data, which is a subfield of image processing and analysis, and hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a possible category. Finally, the paper also involves the use of a newly created dataset, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
