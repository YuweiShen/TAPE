The algorithm presented in the paper is a variation of the Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm, which is commonly used in network information theory and machine learning (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the algorithm, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SI). The use of differential equations to describe the residual graph evolution is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper compares the performance of the TEP decoder with the Belief Propagation (BP) decoder, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
