The use of conformal mapping and complex analysis also suggests a strong connection to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the non-uniform service demand and irregular network topology, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
