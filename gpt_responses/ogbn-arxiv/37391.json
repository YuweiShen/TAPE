The use of multiple learning rates is a common technique in machine learning, and the paper proposes a new method for adapting to a broad class of functions. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
