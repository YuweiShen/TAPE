This topic falls under the broad category of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning. The use of adversarial online learning techniques and the focus on value functions as losses suggest that this paper may belong to the sub-category of machine learning known as online learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of value function approximation and the focus on robotics suggest that this paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of data-dependent adaptive learning rates and the focus on theoretical guarantees suggest that this paper may also belong to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
