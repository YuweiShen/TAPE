This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the creation of multilevel formulas to solve real-world programmable spreadsheet problems, which could also fall under the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. The paper also mentions data retrieval tasks and their algorithms, which could be relevant to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Databases (cs.DB) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents a converted authentic table and coding in full details, which suggests that it could also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
