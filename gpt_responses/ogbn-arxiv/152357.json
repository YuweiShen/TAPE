The authors also mention the use of these codes for error correction in permutation channels, which falls under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper involves some computational aspects, such as determining the existence of perfect codes in higher-dimensional simplices, which could be relevant to computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
