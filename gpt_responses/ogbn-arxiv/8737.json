The planner integrates a database of pre-computed motion primitives, which involves optimization and cost minimization, indicating that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of random sampling and tree-based exploration suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of grid space and obstacle avoidance, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
