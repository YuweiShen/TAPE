Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also involves artificial intelligence techniques for load monitoring, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves signal processing techniques for data cleansing and feature extraction, which makes cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves optimization techniques for hyper-parameter tuning, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the evaluation of the developed model on a publicly available dataset, which makes cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
