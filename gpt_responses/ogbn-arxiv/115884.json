The paper focuses on understanding how these networks learn to model predictions as a combination of multiple Gaussian distributions, making them particularly interesting for problems where a sequence of inputs may lead to several distinct future possibilities. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
