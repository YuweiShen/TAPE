The use of maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of reduced ordered binary decision diagrams, which is a common tool in computer science theory (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
