The paper also discusses the incorporation of odometric information and geometrical constraints, which involves machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of geometrical constraints suggests the possibility of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) being used. Finally, the use of POMDPs suggests the possibility of control theory (cs.SY) being involved."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
