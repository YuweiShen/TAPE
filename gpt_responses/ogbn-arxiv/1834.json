The paper also involves the use of fiber optic communication systems, which could fall under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. The use of mathematical techniques such as the nonlinear Fourier transform suggests that the paper could also belong to the Optimization and Control (cs.OH) or Physics and Society (cs.PF) categories. Finally, the experimental transmission results reported in the paper could fall under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
