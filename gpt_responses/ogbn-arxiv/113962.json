This is a key area of research in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper focuses on the performance of limited feedback systems in cellular networks, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the performance of a system (limited feedback system) in the presence of interference and feedback delay, which is a key area of research in systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the goodput metric, which is a measure of the rate at which bits are successfully received at the mobile station. This is a key area of research in multimedia systems. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not directly deal with issues related to computers and society, but it does have implications for the design and deployment of cellular networks, which are an important part of modern society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
