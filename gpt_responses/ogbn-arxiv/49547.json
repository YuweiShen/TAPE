It also introduces new operators for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, which are a type of logic programming, falling under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of constraint propagators, which are commonly used in constraint satisfaction problems (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a grounder, which is a technique used in natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the use of SAT/ASP solvers, which are commonly used in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
