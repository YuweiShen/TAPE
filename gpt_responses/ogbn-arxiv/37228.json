The paper focuses on the block fading bidirectional relay channel and proposes efficient transmission strategies that exploit the block fading property of the channel. The paper considers a decode-and-forward relay and assumes that a direct link between the two users is not present. The paper aims to characterize the long-term achievable rate region and to develop protocols that achieve all points of the obtained rate region. The paper also considers two different types of transmit power constraints and both delay-unconstrained and delay-constrained transmission. Based on this analysis, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
