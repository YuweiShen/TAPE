The use of one-bit transceivers suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of networked sensing and control (cs.NI). The analysis of the system in a Rayleigh environment may be of interest to researchers in the field of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper may also be relevant to researchers working on machine learning and optimization problems in communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis of the system's capacity may be of interest to researchers in the field of control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
