This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category deals with the use of logic and formal methods in computer science, which is relevant to the study of symbolic computation systems and their parameterization process.\n- cs.CT (Category Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of abstract mathematical structures and their relationships, which is directly relevant to the categorical framework used in the paper.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages, which is indirectly relevant to the study of symbolic computation systems and their parameterization process.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the development and maintenance of software systems, which is directly relevant to the study of symbolic computation systems and their parameterization process.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design, analysis, and implementation of data structures and algorithms, which is indirectly relevant to the study of symbolic computation systems and their parameterization process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
