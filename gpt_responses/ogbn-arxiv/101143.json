The use of meshes as an output representation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques, such as disentanglement and weak supervision, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the approach on synthetic data suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
