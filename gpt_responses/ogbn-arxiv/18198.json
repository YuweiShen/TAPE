The use of maximum likelihood and minimum mean square error estimators also suggests a connection to information theory and statistical learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
