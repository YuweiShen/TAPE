Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with security and attacks, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a likely sub-category. Finally, the use of automatic architecture search suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
