It also involves communication constraints and the efficiency of interactive schemes, which are relevant to cryptography (cs.CR). The use of concave envelopes and correlation coefficients suggests a connection to convex optimization (cs.CC) and probability theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions binary symmetric sources, which are commonly studied in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
