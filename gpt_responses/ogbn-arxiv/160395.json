This suggests that the paper could belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of the game interface and the user experience, which could place it in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories.
