Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of digital certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for V2X security, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The development of the SCMS involves software engineering and system design, which could be classified under cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also mentions the support for V2X use-cases and certificate types, which could be related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
