Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses parallelization techniques, which could fall under the sub-categories cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions handling large datasets, which could also relate to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
