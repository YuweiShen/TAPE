Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the analysis of channel conditions and packet errors, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of multiple antennas and the exploitation of spatial dimensions of the channel could also make it relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves the study of system performance, which could make it relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
