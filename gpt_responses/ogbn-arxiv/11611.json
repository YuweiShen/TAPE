The paper also discusses wave pattern formation, which is a topic in Pattern Formation and Solitons (cs.PF). The use of microbenchmarks and Chebyshev filter diagonalization also suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of Modeling and Simulation (cs.MS) and Applied Mathematics (cs.AR).
