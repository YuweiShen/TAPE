The concept of 3-leaf power graphs is also related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and combinatorics (cs.CC). Finally, the use of parameterized complexity suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
