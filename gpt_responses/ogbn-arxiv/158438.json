This falls under the domain of multimedia analysis and computer vision (cs.MM, cs.CV). The authors also mention using text-based features to detect misleading metadata, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the problem of detecting fake videos can be seen as a cybersecurity issue, which falls under computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the authors propose a deep learning model for classification, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
