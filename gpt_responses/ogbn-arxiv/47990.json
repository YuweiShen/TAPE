The use of a monadic meta-language and the distinction between values and computations suggests a connection to programming languages and type theory, which are covered by sub-categories such as cs.PL and cs.TL. The paper also discusses the lambda-bar-mu-mu-tilde-calculus, which is a specific calculus used in proof theory, indicating a possible connection to sub-categories such as cs.LG and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
