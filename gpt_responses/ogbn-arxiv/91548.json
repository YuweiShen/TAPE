The paper also proposes algorithms for selecting relevant source hypotheses and feature dimensions, which falls under the category of machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of auxiliary source classifiers, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed algorithms on three computer vision datasets, which could fall under cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper mentions the computational cost of the proposed algorithms, which could fall under cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
