The paper also explores these projection theorems from the usual likelihood maximization approach and from the principle of sufficiency. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
