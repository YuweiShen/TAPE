This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including programming languages (cs.PL), human-computer interaction (cs.HCI), software engineering (cs.SE), databases (cs.DB), and machine learning (cs.LG) (since the paper mentions the use of custom lenses). However, since the focus is on bidirectional evaluation and the algorithm is implemented in a programming system, cs.PL and cs.HCI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
