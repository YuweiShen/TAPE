This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses applications to multiple access channels and multiple-input multiple-output systems, which are sub-domains of communication systems. The paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses some parametric fading models and their properties, which may be relevant to the sub-category of modeling and simulation (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
