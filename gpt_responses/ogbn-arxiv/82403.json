This involves exploiting the large dimensional antenna arrays available at mmWave systems to produce direction dependent transmission. Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and techniques for secure transmission. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper focuses on improving the security of vehicular communication systems, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper proposes a technique for secure communication in mmWave vehicular communication systems, which is a key area of research in cryptography and security. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of mmWave technology in vehicular communication systems, which is a key area of research in multimedia. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a physical layer precoding technique for secure communication in mmWave vehicular communication systems, which involves controlling the transmission direction of antenna arrays. This is related to the study of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
