The authors also use machine learning (cs.MM) to train their model and discuss the use of physical constraints in their approach, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experiments and results, which could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
