The use of LDPC codes for the payload link suggests that the paper may also be relevant to networked information systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The proposed methods for encoding and decoding extra bits may involve computational complexity, making the paper relevant to computer architecture and embedded systems (cs.CC). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it deals with the transmission of additional information over a secure channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
