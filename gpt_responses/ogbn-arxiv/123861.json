The proposed approach involves training a network to distill features from one modality to another, which is a common problem in machine learning (ML) and falls under the category of ML algorithms and architectures (cs.LG). The use of multiple stream networks and the consideration of limitations at test time suggest that the paper could also be relevant to multimedia (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the use of soft and hard labels, as well as distance between feature maps, indicates that the paper could be related to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
