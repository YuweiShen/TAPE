Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a novel aggregation procedure and keypoint-based Non-Maximum-Suppression, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed method involves object detection, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
