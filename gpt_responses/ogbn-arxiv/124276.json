This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a novel nonparametric approach to address it. The paper also mentions several meta-regression problems and achieves state-of-the-art results in the robotics benchmark, Omnipush. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
