This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also examines the effect of learning strategy on model robustness, which is a topic commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a type of neural network commonly used in computer vision and machine learning, and thus could also fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a controlled face image dataset, which could also fall under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
