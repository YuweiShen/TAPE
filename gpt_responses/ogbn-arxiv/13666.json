It also involves the use of deep learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it deals with language generation and evaluation metrics. \n\nThe paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a new training method for improving image captioning models. \n\nThe artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques to generate human-like captions. \n\nFinally, the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category may be relevant as the paper deals with the evaluation of generated captions using both objective language metrics and subjective human judgements."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
