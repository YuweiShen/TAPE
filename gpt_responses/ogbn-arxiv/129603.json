The proposed method involves utilizing geometric information of the mesh, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper introduces a message passing scheme, which is a common technique in network analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the expressivity of the proposed model, which is a topic of interest in statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
