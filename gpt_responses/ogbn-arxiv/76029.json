Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses algebraic techniques to study permutation polynomials, which suggests that it may also belong to the Number Theory (math.NT), Algebraic Combinatorics (math.AC), and Representation Theory (math.RT) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
