The paper also involves the use of common randomness, which is a common topic in information-theoretic privacy (cs.ITP) and secure multi-party computation (cs.SI). The paper's approach involves constructing a joint distribution, which is a technique commonly used in probability theory and statistics (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
