These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper discusses the modeling of correlations between channels of convolutional features, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of short connections to remedy information loss is also a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper presents extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
