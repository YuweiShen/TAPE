Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.SP (Speech Processing) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the methodology for choosing the optimal sampling kernels for linear reconstruction, which is related to machine learning and optimization, making cs.MM (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper analyzes the numerical instability inherent in some families of FRI signals, which is a topic related to numerical analysis and linear algebra, making cs.LG (Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Optimization) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
