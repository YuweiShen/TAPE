This involves identifying the influences among the observed processes, those between the latent ones, and those from the latent to the observed ones. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. The paper proposes an algorithm for learning the support of transition matrix in a VAR model with latent processes, which falls under this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents, including their design, implementation, and applications. The paper's focus on learning the support of transition matrix in a VAR model with latent processes is relevant to the study of intelligent agents and their decision-making processes. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the study of social and information networks, including their structure, dynamics, and analysis. The paper's focus on identifying the influences among observed and latent processes in a VAR model is relevant to the study of network structure and dynamics. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of information processing, including its representation, transmission, and storage.
