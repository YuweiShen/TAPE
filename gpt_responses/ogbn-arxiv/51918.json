The paper deals with designing a structured search engine that returns a multi-column table in response to a query consisting of keywords describing each of its columns. The paper focuses on a concrete task of deciding the relevance of a set of web tables to a given query and identifying the mapping between the columns of the table and query columns. This task involves the use of graphical models, co-occurrence statistics, and content overlap across table columns. The paper's focus on search and information retrieval, database systems, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning makes it likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.IR, cs.DB, cs.CL, cs.AI, and cs.DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
