It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it uses the ImageNet-1K dataset. Additionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as neural networks are a key component of AI research. The paper also discusses the quantization of neural networks, which could place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category. Finally, the paper discusses computational complexity, which could place it in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
