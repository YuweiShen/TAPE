The paper also proposes clustering algorithms, which are commonly studied in machine learning and statistics, falling under cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of surface normals in 3D reconstructions suggests a connection to computer graphics, which is often categorized under cs.CL. Finally, the mention of high dimensional directional data such as protein backbone configurations and semantic word vectors suggests a connection to neural networks and natural language processing, which are often categorized under cs.NE and cs.CL, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
