The paper also discusses the need for balancing goal obfuscation and goal legibility, which is a security concern and falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The problem of balancing the needs of cooperative and adversarial entities involves game theory (cs.GT) and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes solution approaches that involve heuristic-guided forward search, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
