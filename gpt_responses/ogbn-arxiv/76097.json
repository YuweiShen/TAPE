Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves communication efficiency and information theory, which suggests cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.IT (Information Theory) as likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with control and optimization, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category.
