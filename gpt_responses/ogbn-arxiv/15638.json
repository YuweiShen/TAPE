The system is designed to help users deal with information overload, which is a common problem in digital libraries and reference managers. The paper also mentions that the system is open source and supports open data, which suggests a focus on data mining and machine learning (cs.DL, cs.LG). Additionally, the system is designed to be easy to integrate and requires no knowledge of recommender systems, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper mentions a pilot partner in the field of social sciences (Sowiport), which suggests a potential focus on cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
