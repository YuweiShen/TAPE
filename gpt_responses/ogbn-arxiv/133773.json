The use of interference alignment technique to mitigate interference suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI) or signal processing (cs.SI). The analysis of efficiency in terms of the number of required channel realizations may also relate to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) or computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
