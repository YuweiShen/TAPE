The focus on O-notation suggests that the paper is related to the analysis of algorithms' time complexity. The use of filters and limits suggests a connection to topology and analysis. The paper's emphasis on linear dominance suggests a connection to computational complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of filters and limits suggests a connection to numerical analysis, which is covered by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the use of O-mappings suggests a connection to programming languages, which is covered by cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
