The model uses a neural attention network to learn the importance of each feature interaction from data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new model for supervised learning that enhances the linear regression model by incorporating the second-order feature interactions. This is a core topic in machine learning, and the paper uses neural attention networks to learn the importance of each feature interaction from data, which is a popular technique in deep learning.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a new model for learning the weight of feature interactions, which is relevant to information retrieval tasks such as ranking and recommendation. The paper also evaluates the proposed model on two real-world datasets, which are commonly used in information retrieval research.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new model for supervised learning that enhances the linear regression model by incorporating the second-order feature interactions. This is a core topic in artificial intelligence, and the paper uses neural attention networks to learn the importance of each feature interaction from data, which is a popular technique in deep learning.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a new model for learning the weight of feature interactions, which is relevant to natural language processing tasks such"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
