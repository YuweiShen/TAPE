Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the encoding of semantics and discourse, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper mentions the release of a corpus as a resource, which could suggest it belongs to cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
