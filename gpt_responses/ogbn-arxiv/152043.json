The paper also proposes a new approach that integrates a change detection mechanism into a deep Siamese-FC tracker, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of deep learning models for tracking also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed approach using state-of-the-art trackers and detectors, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the issue of noisy object detections and the need for reliable VOT, which could be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
