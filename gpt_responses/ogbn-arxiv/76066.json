The method involves training two deep neural networks separately and then using them jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. The approach proposed in the paper is highly interdisciplinary and involves the use of machine learning, chemistry, and biology. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
