This work involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which are commonly associated with the computer science sub-categories of CL (Computation and Language), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and LG (Learning). The use of knowledge graphs and relational facts also suggests a connection to the sub-categories of IR (Information Retrieval) and DB (Databases).
