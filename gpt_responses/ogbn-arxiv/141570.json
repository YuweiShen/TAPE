The algorithm uses a directed acyclic word graph (DAWG) data structure, which is a type of trie, and has applications in various areas of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
