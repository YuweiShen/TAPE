The paper also discusses the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for generating adversarial examples, which is a topic of interest in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
