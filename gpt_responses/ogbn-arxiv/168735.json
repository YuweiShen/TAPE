The paper also discusses type safety and formalizes its idea using a lambda calculus, which suggests a focus on logic in computer science (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to restricting handlers instead of let-bound expressions, which could be relevant to formal methods (cs.FL) and theoretical computer science (cs.THEORY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
