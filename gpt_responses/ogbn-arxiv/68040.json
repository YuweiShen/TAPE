The paper also proposes a novel variant of the Boltzmann exploration strategy, which is a common tool in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses techniques from probability theory and optimization, which are relevant to Data Structures (cs.DS) and Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with multi-armed bandit problems, which are a classic example of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
