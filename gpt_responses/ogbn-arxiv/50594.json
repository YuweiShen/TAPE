The paper discusses the use of adaptive scalar companding and rounding to input matrix blocks followed by two forms of packing in floating-point that allow for concurrent calculation of multiple results. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an acceleration technique for a core element of high-performance linear algebra libraries used in many computationally demanding digital signal processing (DSP) systems. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for efficient computation in DSP systems. \n\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a technique for accelerating the computation of GEMM that involves dynamically adjusting the imprecision (distortion) of computation. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to the design and analysis of hardware architectures for efficient computation in DSP systems. \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an approach that converts matrix multiplication in programmable processors into a computation channel, where increasing the processing throughput leads to an increase in output noise (error) due to coarser quantization and computational errors caused by exceeding the machine-precision limitations.
