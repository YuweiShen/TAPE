However, given that the paper focuses on analyzing the performance of linear precoders in a massive MIMO setup, it is most likely to be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also considers the impact of phase noise on the system's stability and control, which could potentially place it under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with the statistical analysis of the system's performance, which could place it under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
