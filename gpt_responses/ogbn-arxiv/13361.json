The paper proposes a looped deep pseudo-task optimization procedure for automatic category discovery of visually coherent and clinically semantic clusters. This involves exploiting a sequence of pseudo-tasks by the looped deep image feature clustering and deep CNN training/classification using new labels. The paper falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it deals with image recognition and clustering. It also involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques as it deals with obtaining semantic labels, which makes it relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves multimedia techniques as it deals with a large-scale radiology image database, which makes it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
