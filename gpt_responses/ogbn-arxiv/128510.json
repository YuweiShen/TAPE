Specifically, it focuses on determinacy of delay games with Borel winning conditions, which falls under the category of logic (cs.LO) and game theory (cs.GT). The paper also introduces different notions of universal strategies, which involve computational complexity and algorithms, making it relevant to the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
