This involves designing a neural network with convolutional and fully-connected layers for image feature extraction and a fully-connected neural network for text feature extraction. The paper also proposes a correlation alignment technique to align nonlinear correlations of multimodal data distributions in deep neural networks. Given these details, the most likely sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also likely since the paper deals with cross-modal retrieval. Multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) are also possible sub-categories given the use of neural networks and the focus on learning shared representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
