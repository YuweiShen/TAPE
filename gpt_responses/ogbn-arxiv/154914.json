The focus on personal healthcare applications suggests a potential overlap with distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The mention of security and low communication overhead suggests a potential overlap with cryptography and security (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
