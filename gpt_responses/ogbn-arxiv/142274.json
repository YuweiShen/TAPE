The paper specifically focuses on the family of randomization techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to improve robustness. The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of these techniques, which is likely to be of interest to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
