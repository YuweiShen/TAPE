This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), scientific computing (cs.SC), data structures (cs.DS), and mathematical software (cs.MS). However, given the focus on performance optimization and implementation details, we believe that cs.MS is the most likely category, followed by cs.DS and cs.NA. The other two categories are less likely but still plausible, as they are related to the application domains of tensor contractions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
