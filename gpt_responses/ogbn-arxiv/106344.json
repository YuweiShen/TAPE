The paper presents a new technique that uses a summary of an RDF graph as a synopsis and formalises the estimation problem as computing the expectation of query cardinality over all RDF graphs represented by the summary. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including databases (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
