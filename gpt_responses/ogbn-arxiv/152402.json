The use of forbidden configurations and the study of 1-plane graphs suggest a connection to graph theory (cs.DS, cs.DM, cs.GT). The algorithmic aspect of the problem and the discussion of extensions suggest a connection to algorithms and complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
