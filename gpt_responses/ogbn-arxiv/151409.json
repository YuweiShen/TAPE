The paper discusses the use of noise-adding methods to enhance the empirical quality of standard saliency maps, which is a common technique in these fields. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper discusses the relationship between local explanation methods of deep neural networks and higher-order partial derivatives of the score function, which suggests a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
