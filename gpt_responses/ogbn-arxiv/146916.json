This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the PSN layer is designed to address the problem of hard examples, which indicates that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also conducts experiments on face recognition datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the PSN layer is a type of normalization layer, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
