Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of beamforming and frequency carriers, which are related to signal processing and communication theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges and enablers of spectrum pooling, which are related to security and privacy (cs.CR - Cryptography and Security) and system design (cs.COM - Computer Systems and Networking). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential benefits of spectrum pooling, which are related to mmWave technology (cs.MM - Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
