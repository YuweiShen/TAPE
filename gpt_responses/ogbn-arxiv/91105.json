However, since the paper focuses on the optimization of the training process using an evolutionary algorithm, cs.NE and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The use of RBMs and deep neural networks also suggests cs.AI and cs.CV as possible sub-categories. Finally, the mention of high-dimensional problems and optimization methods points towards cs.DS as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
