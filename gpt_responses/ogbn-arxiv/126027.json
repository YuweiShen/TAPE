This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as attention-based extractors and hierarchical document encoders, which are commonly used in the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of side information also suggests relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves deep learning techniques such as neural networks, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
