The paper also discusses the preservation of relational parametricity, which is a topic in logic and verification (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper explores the use of Abstracting Gradual Typing methodology, which is a technique used in type systems (cs.TL). The paper also discusses the challenges in designing a gradual language and the semantic issues that arise, which are topics in software engineering (cs.SE) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
