It also involves the use of latent space state representation, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics) as it deals with reinforcement learning and control tasks. The use of entropy regularization and exploration in action and state space also suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper's application to 3D maze navigation and continuous control domains may also indicate a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
