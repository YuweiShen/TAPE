Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also introduces a novel method that involves solving a non-smooth block-sparsity inducing optimization problem, which suggests a possible fit with the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of auxiliary continuous input variables, which could be relevant to the category cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing). The paper also deals with the challenge of exploring an exponential number of switching sequences, which could be relevant to the category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper involves the design of an optimal controller, which could be relevant to the category cs.OH (Other Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
