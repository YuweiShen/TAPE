This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The system also learns the reliability of textual clues, which suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component. The paper also discusses experiments on a prototype, which suggests a software engineering (cs.SE) aspect. Finally, the paper is focused on text processing, which suggests a programming languages (cs.PL) aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
