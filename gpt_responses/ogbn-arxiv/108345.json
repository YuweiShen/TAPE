The paper also introduces a novel exemplar buffer module and uses machine learning techniques such as the one cycle policy, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the model's ability to adapt to potential target deformation, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper benchmarks the model on datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
