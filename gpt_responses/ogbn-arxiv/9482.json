This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses information capacity and retrieval accuracy, which are topics commonly studied in the Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes novel models with recency effects, which may fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of these models, which may be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
