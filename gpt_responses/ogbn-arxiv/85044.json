Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also uses graph-convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of neural networks developed for modeling graph-structured data, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses predicted syntactic dependency trees of source sentences, which could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach with English-German and English-Czech translation experiments, which could also suggest it belongs to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
