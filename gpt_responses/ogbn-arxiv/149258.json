However, since the paper focuses on security protocols, cs.CR is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.HC for the user interaction aspect, and then cs.CV and cs.MM for the visual channel and augmented reality components. cs.IR is less likely but still possible, as the paper discusses information verification and authentication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
