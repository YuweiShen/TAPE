This falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of semantic spaces to capture the similarities between different musical concepts, which could fall under the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.CL) and semantic web (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a method that scales to large datasets, which could fall under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
