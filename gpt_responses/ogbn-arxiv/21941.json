The paper also discusses the issue of fine-tuning CNNs for cross-dataset scenarios, which falls under the domain adaptation subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of different strategies for fine-tuning CNNs, which involves analyzing experimental results and comparing different approaches, indicating a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
