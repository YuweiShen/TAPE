The proposed method aims to improve the quality of embeddings, which is a core task in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on clustering tasks, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the method on image retrieval tasks, which is a sub-topic of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
