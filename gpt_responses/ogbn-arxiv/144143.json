The paper combines mission, behavior, and local motion planning and maps features of the environment and driving kinematics into complex reward functions. This work involves the use of neural networks and inverse reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) in the context of automated driving, which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
