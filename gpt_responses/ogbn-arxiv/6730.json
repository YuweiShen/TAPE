Additionally, the paper discusses the use of recurrent neural networks for end-to-end learning of motion policies, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions the need for the agent to reason about the effects of its motions on its view of the world, which suggests that it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of machine learning techniques for learning policies and forecasting effects also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
