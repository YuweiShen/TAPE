The authors also propose a principled approach to tackle this problem, which involves formulating a new strategy for data processing, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves quantitative analyses, which suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
