This falls under the domain of machine learning and hence cs.LG is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Optimal Transport has been widely used in computer vision for tasks such as image registration and object tracking. The proposed approach can also be applied to these tasks, making cs.CV a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning approach for solving a mathematical optimization problem, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. Hence, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a statistical approach for solving the Optimal Transport problem, which involves estimating the embeddings of the marginals. This falls under the domain of statistics and hence cs.ST is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a regularization technique based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which is a measure of distance between probability distributions. This falls under the domain of information theory and hence cs.IT is a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
