The paper also covers a broad family of losses, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or information theory (cs.IT). The use of weak learners and the study of empirical risk minimization are also common in boosting algorithms, which may suggest the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the decomposition of instances, which may suggest the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
