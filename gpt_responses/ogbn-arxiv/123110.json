It also involves multiple users and channels, which are common in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper discusses cooperation among users, which is a topic in social networks (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas is a key aspect of the paper, which is a topic in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM).
