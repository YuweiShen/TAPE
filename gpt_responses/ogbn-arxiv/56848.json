The algorithm is based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a popular method in the field of reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with the problem of stability and slowness in deep reinforcement learning, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a method for training multiple agents simultaneously, which is related to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
