The proposed method involves learning an adaptive visual-semantic mapping, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method also involves utilizing similarities between categories, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM).
