FL-GCNs are a type of neural network that can recognize spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously. This paper falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new model for prediction. It also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses neural networks. The paper deals with network engineering (cs.NE) as it involves transportation networks. It also involves signal processing (cs.SI) as it deals with traffic flow data. Finally, it involves information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the prediction of O-D information from link traffic flows."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
