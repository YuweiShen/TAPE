The use of SAT encoding suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the optimization of the networks using hand-crafted first layers and the improvement of upper bounds suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
