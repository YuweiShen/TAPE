The paper also proposes an effective method to extract useful information from distorted readings collected by the ultrasonic sensor, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of indoor maps, which can be created using computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of path planning methods to minimise robot turning times and covering distances, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the implementation of the algorithms in MATLAB, which is a popular machine learning platform (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
