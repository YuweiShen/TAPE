The proposed method involves multi-scale paths and learning to synthesize features from different scales, which suggests the use of deep learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also involves experiments on public datasets, which suggests the use of multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
