The paper also introduces a logical system to describe this interplay, which is a topic in mathematical logic (cs.LO). The concept of coalition strategies is often studied in game theory (cs.GT), and the paper's focus on distributed knowledge and collaboration suggests that it may also be relevant to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
