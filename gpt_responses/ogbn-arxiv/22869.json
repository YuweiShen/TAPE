Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to mine EHRs, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a likely category. The use of support vector machines and distributed word representations suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as another possible category. The paper also deals with healthcare-related issues, which could place it in cs.CY (Computers and Society) or cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
