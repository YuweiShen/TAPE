It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as Federated Learning is a subfield of AI. Additionally, the paper deals with data heterogeneity, which is a common issue in data science, making it likely to belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions classifiers, which are commonly used in computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses active sampling, which is a topic in social influence and network analysis, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
