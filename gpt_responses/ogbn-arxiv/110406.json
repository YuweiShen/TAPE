Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also uses information theory and communication protocols, which suggest cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on reducing communication cost and optimizing multi-party settings may also place it in cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
