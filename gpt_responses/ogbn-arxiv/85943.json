The technique relies on finding a subset of points called landmarks along the data manifold to construct a weighted witness-graph over it. This graph captures the structural characteristics of the point cloud, and its weights are determined using a Finite Markov Chain. The paper also applies induced maps from standard community detection algorithms to compress the graph and prune and reinstate edges in the induced graph based on their modularity to summarize the shape of data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper proposes a technique for visualizing point cloud data that captures the underlying geometric and topological structure of the data. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper presents a visualization technique for point cloud data that can be useful in computer vision applications. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses standard dimensionality reduction algorithms as the filter function and applies community detection algorithms to compress the graph, which are common techniques in machine learning. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a technique for constructing a weighted witness-graph over a subset of points called landmarks along the data manifold, which can be seen as a data structure. \n- cs.SI ("}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
