This falls under the scope of computational science and engineering.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses refactoring and hardware abstraction as solutions to improve the quality and maintainability of legacy code. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses optimizing code for new architectures, such as KNL and Skylake. This falls under the scope of computer architecture.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses scalability and performance-portability, which are important aspects of distributed and parallel computing.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the journey from a Fortran code to a C++ port, as well as the use of vectorization and reduced precision. These are all related to programming languages and their features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
