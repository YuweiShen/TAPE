It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a two-layer model that leverages both context and external knowledge. Additionally, it may belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves the use of knowledge attention mechanism to ensure the model is leveraging the appropriate source of external knowledge. Finally, it may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it uses neural networks for the coreference resolution task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
