Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of crowdsourcing platforms for data acquisition, which falls under the category of human computation and machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The use of deep learning models for classification also falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of the proposed method for driving and mobility autonomy, which falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of Google Street View for data acquisition, which falls under the category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
