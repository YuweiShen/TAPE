The focus on video streaming and backhaul capacity constraints suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication security (cs.CR). The use of optimization algorithms and complexity analysis points towards a possible association with data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
