The paper proposes a new framework for MKL that casts the problem as a binary classification task with additional constraints. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers working in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
