The paper also involves the analysis of physical transmission constraints and the boundary effect of network fields, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper provides guidelines for the design of secure sensor networks, which may fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
