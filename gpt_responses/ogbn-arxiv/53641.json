The paper also involves reductions, which is a technique commonly used in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problems considered in the paper involve substrings and patterns, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper discusses upper and lower bounds, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
