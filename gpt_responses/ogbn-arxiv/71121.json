The paper also discusses the use of code decompositions, which is a technique commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC). The proposed kernels are evaluated based on their polarization rates, which is a measure of their performance, and this is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves the construction of kernels of specific sizes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of the proposed kernels with existing ones, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
