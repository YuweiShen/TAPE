The method involves modelling the adjacency matrix of a binary relation and learning target vectors for each instance. This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), or Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
