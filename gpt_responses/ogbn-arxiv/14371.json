The mention of dictionaries and quantification of meaning in academic texts suggests a connection to natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of Web of Science (WoS) and citation analysis may also indicate a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the mention of word frequencies and word lists suggests a connection to deep learning (cs.DL) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
