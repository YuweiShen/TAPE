This problem requires a supporting reasoning system, which involves knowledge engineering, rule cross-compiler, and real-time inference engine with meta-reasoning capabilities. These topics are closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), and computer engineering (cs.CE).
