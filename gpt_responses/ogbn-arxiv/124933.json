The paper proposes a zero-shot entity typing approach that requires no annotated data and can flexibly identify newly defined types. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also makes use of an inference algorithm, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its system on a broad range of datasets, including a dataset in the biological domain, which suggests that it could also belong to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
