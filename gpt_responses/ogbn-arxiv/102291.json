The paper proposes a new approach to extractive QA using an iterative search problem, which involves selecting the answer's sentence, start word, and end word. This approach involves globally normalizing the decision process and back-propagating through beam search, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are all related to NLP and machine learning. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and neural networks (NE), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
