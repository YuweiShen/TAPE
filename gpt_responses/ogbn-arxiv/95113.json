The system uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for onboard sensing, estimation, and planning, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a novel procedure based on cycle consistent multiway matching, which involves computer vision and machine learning techniques (cs.CV, cs.LG). The system also involves collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (CSLAM), which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a solution to overcome high measurement noise and perceptual aliasing, which involves artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
