The paper also discusses structural results and decentralized (multi-terminal) setups, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of i.i.d. and Markov sources suggests a connection to probability theory and stochastic processes, which are relevant to mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
