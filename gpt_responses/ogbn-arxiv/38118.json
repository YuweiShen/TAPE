This falls under the category of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of determinants and matrices suggests a connection to Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Combinatorics (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of polynomial-time algorithms suggests a connection to Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
