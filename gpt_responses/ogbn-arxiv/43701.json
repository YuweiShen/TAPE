This involves defining concept scores and computing gradients to generate concept saliency maps that highlight input features relevant to these concepts. The paper applies this method to both image data (CelebA dataset) and spatial transcriptomic (ST) data of a mouse olfactory bulb. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper deals with deep learning models and image data. The sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also possible, as the paper discusses the potential of the method in advancing our understanding of complex biological systems and the use of natural language processing in generating concept vectors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
