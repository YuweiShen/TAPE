The focus on monitoring and mitigating attacks suggests a strong emphasis on security (cs.CR), while the application to flight control systems implies a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of software, firmware, and hardware also suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE), while the real-time nature of the monitors and the use of adaptable security suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
