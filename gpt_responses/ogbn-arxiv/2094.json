The proposed framework involves incorporating illumination and rotation invariance, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of displacement consistency on correlation filter trackers, which is related to robotics and control (cs.RO). Finally, the experiments are conducted on a video dataset, indicating the use of multimedia techniques (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
