The paper proposes a new technique called delayed promotion to compute dominions in parity games. This technique involves a relaxed form of dominion and dominion space, which are concepts that are closely related to logic and automata theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper involves graph algorithms and game theory, which are topics that are often studied in the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), respectively. The paper also proposes a new instantiation of the solution procedure, which involves heuristics and optimization techniques, which are topics that are often studied in the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). Therefore, the five most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LO, cs.DS, cs.GT, cs.AI, and cs.PL, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
