The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on several image datasets, including COCO, PASCAL, ImageNet detection, and NYU-Depth V2 datasets. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed approach utilizes a CNN-based category agnostic object location refinement module, which can be considered as an AI technique. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an active strategy for generating box proposals that starts from a set of seed boxes and progressively moves its attention on the promising image areas, which can be considered as a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed approach can be applied to robotics tasks that involve object detection and localization. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper evaluates the proposed approach on several multimedia datasets, including COCO, PASCAL, ImageNet detection, and NYU-Depth V2 datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
