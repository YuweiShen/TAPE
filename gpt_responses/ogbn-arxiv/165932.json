This task is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) as it requires the use of deep learning models for feature extraction and classification. Additionally, the evaluation dataset used in the paper is built by the authors themselves, which suggests that the paper may also fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
