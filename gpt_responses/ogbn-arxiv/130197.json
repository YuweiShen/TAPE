The use of Cellular Automata in modeling physical processes such as bootstrap percolation, forest fire or epidemic propagation models, life without death, etc, suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The investigation of the universality of Freezing Cellular Automata (FCA) and the conditions required for intrinsically universal FCA may also fall under the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
