Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new LTR algorithm using policy-gradient approach, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses fairness constraints, which can be related to cybersecurity (cs.CY) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
