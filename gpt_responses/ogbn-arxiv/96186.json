The use of Holder's inequality and reverse Holder's inequality suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the bounds, which is a topic in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The comparison with other existing lower bounds suggests a connection to signal processing and image/video processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
