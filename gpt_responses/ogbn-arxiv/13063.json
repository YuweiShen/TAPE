This task falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) domains. The proposed technique involves using a recursive training strategy, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.DL) to improve model performance with limited data. Finally, the paper focuses on a medical application, which falls under the medical imaging (cs.MED) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
