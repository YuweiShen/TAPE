The paper also proposes algorithms that are adaptive to partial or absent knowledge of the problem parameters, which is a common theme in machine learning research.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes algorithms for detecting mixture distributions, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence research. The paper also discusses the application of the proposed algorithms to the most biased coin problem, which is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and decision theory.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms for solving the most biased coin problem and characterizes the sample complexity of differentiating between a single parametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions. These are classic problems in data structures and algorithms research.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the problem of distinguishing between two kinds of coins with very similar means or heavy coins that are just extremely rare. This is a classic problem in information theory and statistical inference.\n5. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper discusses the problem of distinguishing between a single parametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions, which is a classic problem in statistics. The paper also characterizes the sample complexity of this problem, which is a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
