The paper also proposes a novel approach using teacher-student method, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of compressed video data, which involves compression techniques and information theory, making the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category a likely fit as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
