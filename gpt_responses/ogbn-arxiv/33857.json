Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a bi-style model that can synthesise both neutral-style and newscaster-style speech, which involves machine learning and deep learning techniques, making cs.SD (Sound) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions conditioning the model on contextual word embeddings, which is a technique used in natural language processing, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed model against neutral NTTS and neutral concatenative-based synthesis, which involves comparing different models and techniques, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
