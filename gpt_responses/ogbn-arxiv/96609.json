The approach proposed involves optimization and learning techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of hierarchical clustering, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT).
