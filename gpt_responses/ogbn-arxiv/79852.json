The use of cameras and LiDAR for sensing and making inferences about the surroundings is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of point correspondences for calibration, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
