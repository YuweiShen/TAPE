This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the construction and properties of binary linear LRCs, which involves concepts from coding theory (cs.CC) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The analysis of the locality and availability of LRCs involves the study of combinatorial structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
