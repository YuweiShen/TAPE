The proposed strategy is based on the Capture Point concept, which involves predicting the future location of the robot's center of mass and generating references for the momentum-based torque controller, indicating a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions experiments in a simulator and on the iCub humanoid robot, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
