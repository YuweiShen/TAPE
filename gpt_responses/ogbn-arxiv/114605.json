The paper also uses information theory (cs.IT) to prove a lower bound on the sparsity of additive spanners. Additionally, the paper involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) in the analysis of the tradeoff between sparsity and approximation quality. Finally, the paper discusses related objects such as emulators, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
