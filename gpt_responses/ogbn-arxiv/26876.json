The paper also presents analytical expressions for the uplink data rate, which involves system modeling and analysis (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas at the base station and the impact of spatial correlation on the data rate are also discussed, which falls under the category of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the power scaling law of the two methods, which is related to communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
