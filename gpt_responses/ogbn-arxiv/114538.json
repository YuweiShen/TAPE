The paper also discusses the impact of channel correlation on system performance, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). The use of physical models to capture variations in the power angular spectra across multiple terminals suggests a focus on multimedia systems (cs.MM) and mobile computing (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
