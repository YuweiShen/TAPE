The focus on using SRAM in microcontroller units and batteryless computational RFID devices suggests a connection to embedded systems (cs.CY) and emerging technologies (cs.ET). The use of fuzzy extractors for turning noisy PUF responses into usable cryptographic keys relates to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the development of a lightweight and secure PUF key generator for resource-limited devices involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
