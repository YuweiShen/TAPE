The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in designing agents with explicit motivations for cooperation. The experiments conducted in the paper involve training agents to maximize a selfish objective function, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the concept of social dilemmas and the dynamics of agent interactions, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
