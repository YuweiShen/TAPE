The paper also uses image classification tasks as a case study, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of the backpropagation algorithm, which is a fundamental optimization technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the security of machine learning systems (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
