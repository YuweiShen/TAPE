The proposed method involves selecting features based on the size of the pedestrian, which requires some level of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions incorporating complementary feature channels, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
