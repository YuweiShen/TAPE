The use of natural language processing techniques to analyze the resulting corpus of utterances suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL). The study of how people verbalize visual representations of data is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and information visualization (cs.SI). Finally, the development of a semantic lexicon for aligning visualizations and verbalizations of data suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
