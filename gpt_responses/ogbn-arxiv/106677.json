The paper also discusses the theoretical properties of the model, including its steady-state and mixing time, which suggests that it may be of interest to researchers in information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents experiments comparing the model to other sequential models, which suggests that it may be of interest to researchers in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
