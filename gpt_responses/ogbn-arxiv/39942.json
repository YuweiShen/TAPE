The use of common randomness and communication constraints also suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY) and a distributed computing aspect (cs.DC). Finally, the problem of generating correlated random variables has applications in networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
