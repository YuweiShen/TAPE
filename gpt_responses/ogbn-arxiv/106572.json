The proposed method involves designing a new loss function, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of margin ReLU and partial L2 distance function suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE). The evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation indicates the relevance to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
