The paper also proposes a distributed algorithm for computing approximate distance sketches, which involves storing and processing data in a distributed manner, making it relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and parallel computing (cs.PF). The paper also discusses tradeoffs between different parameters in the distance sketch construction, which involves algorithmic design and analysis, making it relevant to algorithms (cs.AL) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions several networking applications of distance sketches, such as topology discovery, load balancing, and monitoring overlays, which further support the relevance of the paper to networked systems (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
