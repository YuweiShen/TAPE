The use of mathematical content and academic citations suggests that the paper may belong to the natural language processing (NLP) sub-category (cs.CL) or the information retrieval (IR) sub-category (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper's focus on STEM disciplines suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (ML) sub-category (cs.LG) or the software engineering (SE) sub-category (cs.SE). Finally, the fact that the paper deals with large datasets and uses computational methods suggests that it may also belong to the digital libraries (DL) sub-category (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
