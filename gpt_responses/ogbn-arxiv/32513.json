Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves wireless communication and networking, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as the second likely category. The paper also involves system design and optimization, which suggests the category cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the third likely category.
