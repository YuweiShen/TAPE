This involves developing a model named Progmosis that quantifies the risk based on movement and regional aggregated statistics about infection rates. The paper is likely to fall under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses mobile network data to analyze and quantify epidemic outbreaks, which involves studying the spread of disease through social networks. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of technology (mobile networks) to address societal issues (epidemic outbreaks). \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with issues related to risk management and containment strategies during epidemic outbreaks, which involves ensuring the security and privacy of individuals' data. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a model (Progmosis) that quantifies contagion risk based on movement and regional aggregated statistics, which involves studying the dynamics of complex systems. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper develops and releases an open-source tool that calculates contagion risk based on cellular network events, which involves software engineering principles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
