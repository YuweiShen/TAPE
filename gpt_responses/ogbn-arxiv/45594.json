It also involves the use of deep learning models for pre-training and fine-tuning, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of web data and automatic identification of hard clips suggests that this paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques for annotation, which could potentially relate to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
