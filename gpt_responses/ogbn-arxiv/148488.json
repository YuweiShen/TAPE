It could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as these fields are closely related to NLP. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as machine translation evaluation involves finding the most relevant translation for a given text. Finally, Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) is a less likely sub-category as the paper proposes a new human evaluation metric, which could be relevant to the design of user interfaces for machine translation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
