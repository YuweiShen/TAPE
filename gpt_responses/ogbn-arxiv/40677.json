This problem is relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and formal languages (cs.FL). The paper proposes an algorithm for reachability analysis of innermost rewriting, which is a technique used in program analysis and verification (cs.SE). The paper also includes formal proofs of the soundness and precision of the proposed technique, which is related to logic (cs.LO) and semantics (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
