The algorithm involves instance selection, multi-granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables, and the evolutionary learning of the rule base that uses the Elastic Net regularization to obtain the consequents of the rules. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a new machine learning algorithm for regression problems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of fuzzy systems, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves the use of evolutionary learning for rule base generation. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves the use of fuzzy systems for control applications. \n- cs.DM (Data Mining): The paper involves the use of data mining techniques for instance selection and fuzzy discretization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
