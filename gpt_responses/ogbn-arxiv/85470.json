These models are commonly used in the fields of machine learning and computer vision, which are covered by the arXiv sub-categories cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.AI. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on real-world applications, which suggests relevance to the sub-categories cs.CL (natural language processing) and cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
