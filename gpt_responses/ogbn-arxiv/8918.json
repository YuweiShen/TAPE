However, the focus on millimeter-wave massive MIMO channels and the use of hybrid precoding techniques suggest that cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The use of artificial noise to interfere with eavesdroppers suggests that cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a likely sub-category. The use of statistical measures to characterize the impact of channel sparsity suggests that cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) could also be a relevant sub-category. The use of wireless channels suggests that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is also a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
