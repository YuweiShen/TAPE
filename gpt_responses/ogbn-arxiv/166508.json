The paper also introduces a new dataset for anomaly detection in human poses. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
