The focus on precision and tailoring it to the values of activations suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of on-the-fly detection and adjustment of precision also suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a practical implementation of the hardware accelerator, which could potentially fit under the sub-category of architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
