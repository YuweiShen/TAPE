The use of deep learning models also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for personalized feedback to support novice surgeons, which could fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
