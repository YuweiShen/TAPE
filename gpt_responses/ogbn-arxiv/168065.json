Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves graph theory and algorithms, which suggests cs.LG and cs.DS as likely sub-categories. The paper specifically mentions planning domains, which is a subfield of automated planning, indicating cs.PL as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of the problem, which could be relevant to cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
