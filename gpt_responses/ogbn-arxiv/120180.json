The paper proposes algorithms and lower bounds for sample complexity, which are relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI) concepts related to noisy comparisons."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
