This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the design of a network-coding scheme for a relay network, which involves the use of multiple antennas at the users and the relay. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper involves the design of a system for relaying information between two users using a multi-antenna relay. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the transmission of multiple streams of information between two users using a multi-antenna relay. This falls under the scope of multimedia.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper involves the use of mathematical techniques to analyze the performance of the proposed network-coding scheme.
