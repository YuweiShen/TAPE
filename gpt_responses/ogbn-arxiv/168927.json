Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses channel coding and network source coding problems, which are related to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of Reed-Solomon codes suggests a possible connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of polar codes suggests a possible connection to cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
