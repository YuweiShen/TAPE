Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also mentions propositional logic and deductive systems, which are topics in cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of proof nets also involves graph theory, which is a topic in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the translation of deductive proofs into proof nets, which is a topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper mentions the goal of making the literature on proof nets more accessible, which is a topic in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
