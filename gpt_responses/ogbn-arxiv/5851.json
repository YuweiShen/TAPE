This involves the development of a non-linear model that characterizes battery performance as a function of state of charge and requested power, and a linear reformulation of the model for computational efficiency. The paper also compares the proposed model with three other modelling approaches. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper deals with the modelling and control of a complex system (Li-ion batteries) in an optimization problem. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as the paper involves the development of a detailed model and a linear reformulation for computational efficiency. cs.ET (Energy) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper deals with the characterization and optimization of energy storage units and their technical operational limits."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
