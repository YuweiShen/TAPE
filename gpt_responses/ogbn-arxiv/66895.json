The use of multi-scale convolutional neural networks and deconvolution sub-networks also suggests that the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the practical application of the proposed method for autonomous driving, which may also fall under the robotics (cs.RO) category.
