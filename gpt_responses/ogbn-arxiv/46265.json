The use of Gentzen's negative translation also suggests a logical approach. \n\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the structures of terms in System T, which is a functional programming language. The monadic translation is also a technique used in programming language theory. \n\n3. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) - The paper deals with a formal system (System T) and its translation, which is a topic in formal languages and automata theory. \n\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper may be relevant to information theory as it deals with a formal system and its translation, which can be seen as a form of encoding and decoding. \n\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper may be relevant to computational complexity as it deals with a formal system and its translation, which can have implications for the complexity of computations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
