Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories, as these fields are closely related to video streaming and network performance. Additionally, the paper uses computer vision techniques such as convolutional neural networks (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT) to analyze video quality. Finally, the paper also uses machine learning techniques such as LSTM (cs.AI) to improve the accuracy of the QoE model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
