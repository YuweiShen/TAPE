This work involves speech processing, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, cs.SD (Speech and Dialogue) is the most likely category. The paper also involves deep neural networks, which is a popular topic in machine learning. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories. The paper defines an objective function to solve an underdetermined system of equations, which involves optimization techniques. Therefore, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is also a likely category. Finally, the paper involves the development of expressions for fine-tuning the network, which involves neural network architecture. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
