The method involves clustering and calculating anomaly scores for each light-curve in relation to a set of centroids. This involves the use of machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering and sampling. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the method in finding known anomalies, which falls under the category of computational astrophysics (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the validation of the method on both light-curve data and other time series data sets, which falls under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
