Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper proposes auction-based solutions for dynamic spectrum resource sharing, which involves game theory and mechanism design, making cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely categories as well. The paper also mentions simulation results that involve multimedia traffic, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) category.
