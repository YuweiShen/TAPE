The paper proposes a multi-task learning framework that involves predicting bandwidth requirement and duration of a flow along with the traffic class. This involves the use of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning models (cs.LG), and the paper also discusses the challenges of labeling data, which is a common issue in machine learning (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a novel approach to traffic classification, which involves predicting additional features beyond the traffic class, which can be useful in many applications, including routing, resource allocation, and QoS provisioning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the experiments conducted on public datasets, which involves the evaluation of the proposed approach (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
