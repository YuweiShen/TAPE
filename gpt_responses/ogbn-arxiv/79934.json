The use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key aspect of the paper, which falls under information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the optimization problem and the use of simulation results suggest that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
