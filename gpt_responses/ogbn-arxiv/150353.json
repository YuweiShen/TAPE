The paper proposes a new method for hard example mining, which involves training a deep multi-attribute classifier, and using it to encode each image into an attribute probabilistic description. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. Additionally, the paper involves experiments on two person re-identification benchmarks, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of identifying hard person identities, which may involve some aspects of computer security, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
