This involves the use of AI techniques. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed model is based on a triple-branch encoder-decoder architecture, which involves the use of machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics) - The paper deals with image deblurring, which is a problem in computer graphics. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The proposed model is evaluated on a large-scale dataset that spans a broad range of scenes, human object sizes, motion patterns, and background complexities, which involves multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
