The paper also discusses the potential application of CNCs in wireless networks, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper proposes a decoding scheme that reduces the complexity of decodability check, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the relation between coding topology and the local encoding kernel matrices, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
