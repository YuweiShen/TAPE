The paper proposes a QoE-driven rate adaptation system that optimizes the uplink and downlink bandwidths and information concerning each user's real-time field-of-view. This involves optimization techniques and algorithms, which are typically studied in the areas of multimedia (cs.MM), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), information theory (cs.IT), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
