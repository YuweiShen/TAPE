Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel way of generating video by encoding a caption, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks, making cs.LG and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper deals with human videos, which falls under the multimedia (MM) and graphics (GR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
