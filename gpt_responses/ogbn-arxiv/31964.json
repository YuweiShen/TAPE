This involves joint estimation of the spectra of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery. This method can easily identify and remove the spectral peaks of motion artifact (MA) in the PPG spectra, which is a common problem in PPG-based heart rate monitoring during physical activities. The paper also discusses the potential use of this method in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SI (Signal Processing). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.BE (Biomedical Engineering), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these fields are closely related to the proposed method and its potential applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
