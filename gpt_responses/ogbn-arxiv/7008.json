The paper proposes good practices for building effective CNN baseline models for this task, which involves deep learning techniques (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of optimization algorithms (such as Adam) and the impact of training procedures on model performance, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the challenges of human pose variation and occlusion, which are related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
