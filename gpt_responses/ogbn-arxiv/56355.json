The focus on practical use cases suggests that the paper may belong to the databases (cs.DB) or information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. However, the mention of graph analysis techniques and features suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The mention of industry and academia suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
