This is a core topic in computational complexity. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithmic approach to the problem of deciding the tractability of a constraint language, and also provides a data structure (coloured graph) that captures the structure of the language. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with constraint satisfaction, which is a topic that has connections to logic and model theory. The dichotomy theorem for CSP is a result of logical nature. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Constraint satisfaction is a fundamental problem in AI, and the paper deals with a variant of CSP that is relevant to AI applications. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with combinatorial structures (constraint languages) and their properties, which is a topic of interest in discrete mathematics.
