The paper also discusses the vulnerabilities of binary neural networks, which can be categorized under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also relevant to this paper. Finally, the discussion of stochastic quantization and its impact on attacks falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
