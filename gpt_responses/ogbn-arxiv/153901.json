These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with anomaly detection, which is a common problem in the field of neural networks and deep learning, further supporting the possibility of cs.LG or cs.AI. The paper also mentions the use of external factors, which could fall under the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the experimental study involves traffic flow data, which could potentially fall under the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
