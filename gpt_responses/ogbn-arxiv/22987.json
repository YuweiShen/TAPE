Additionally, the use of machine learning methods and neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The study of human behavior and cognition also suggests that it may belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category.
