The paper also demonstrates substantial improvement in accuracy on several synthetic and real datasets in both supervised and unsupervised tasks, which is a common evaluation metric in machine learning. \n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new framework for modeling complex distributions, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The paper also introduces algorithms based on cumulant extraction that provably learn each of the components without having to model the other components, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence. \n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the problem of finding patterns that are unique to one or to a subset of the views, which is a common problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. The paper also demonstrates substantial improvement in accuracy on several real datasets, which is a common evaluation metric in computer vision and pattern recognition. \n\n4. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a new framework for modeling complex distributions, which is a core topic in statistics.
