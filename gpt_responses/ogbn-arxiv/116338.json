This involves setting auxiliary rewards for low-level skill training based on the advantage function of the high-level policy, which enables efficient, simultaneous learning of the high-level policy and low-level skills without using task-specific knowledge. The paper also includes theoretical proofs and experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Given the focus on reinforcement learning and machine learning techniques, as well as the experimental results in robotics and computer vision domains, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
