This involves modeling pairwise feature interactions across modalities and controlling their relative importance via a gating-based attention mechanism. The approach is validated using glioma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Given the focus on deep learning, multimodal data fusion, and biomedical applications, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
