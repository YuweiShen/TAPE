Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses different training schemes and effective improvements, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also evaluates the efficiency and speed of the surveyed trackers, which is related to multimedia and robotics, making cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics) possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
