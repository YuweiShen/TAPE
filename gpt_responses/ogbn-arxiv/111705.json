The use of interleaving technique and Ding-Helleseth-Lam sequences also suggests a possible connection to coding theory (cs.DS). The study of the 2-adic complexity of the sequences may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
