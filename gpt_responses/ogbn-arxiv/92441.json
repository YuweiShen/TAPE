The paper proposes a novel approach called Adaptive Feature Norm, which aims to address the issue of erratic discrimination of the target domain due to its smaller feature norms compared to the source domain. This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). However, given that the paper focuses on image classification tasks, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
