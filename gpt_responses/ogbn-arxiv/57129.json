Information theory is closely related to signal processing and estimation, which are the main topics of this paper.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Although the paper is not directly related to social networks, the technique of sparse recovery is widely used in network analysis and data mining. The paper also mentions joint sparse recovery with several training samples, which is a common technique in network analysis.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses statistical-based STAP methods and joint sparse recovery to estimate the clutter characteristics. These are common techniques in machine learning and pattern recognition.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - Although the paper is not directly related to computer vision, the technique of sparse recovery is widely used in image and video processing. The paper also mentions the angle-Doppler domain, which is a common feature space in radar imaging.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new STAP algorithm that can be used in spaceborne or airborne radar systems. Systems and control is a relevant sub-category for this type of application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
