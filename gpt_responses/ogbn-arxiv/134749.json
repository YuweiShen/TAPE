This falls under the scope of computer graphics.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper also conducts controlled user studies to evaluate different designs, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction research.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The flow data being visualised contains information about flows of people, trade, and knowledge between places, which can be seen as a type of social and information network.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper's focus on visualising flows of people, trade, and knowledge between places has implications for understanding societal and economic trends.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The flow data being visualised can also be seen as a type of multiagent system, where agents (e.g. people, goods) are moving between different locations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
