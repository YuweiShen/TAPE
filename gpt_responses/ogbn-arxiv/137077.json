The paper also discusses the reduction of power consumption and energy efficiency, which falls under the categories of embedded systems (ET) and systems and control (SY). The paper proposes new architectures for BNN inference, which involves machine learning (LG) techniques. Finally, the paper analyzes the local properties of images and learned BNN kernel weights, which falls under the category of computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
