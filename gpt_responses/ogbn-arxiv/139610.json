The paper specifically focuses on the limitations of mutual information maximization, which is a common objective function in unsupervised learning, and proposes a new approach based on the Wasserstein distance. This makes the paper relevant to sub-categories such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
