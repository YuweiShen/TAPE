The paper proposes and evaluates novel fusion techniques for utilizing visual context at different stages of the NMT pipeline, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the quality of visual embeddings extracted from deep vision models, which is a key aspect of multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
