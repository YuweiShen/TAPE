The system also uses machine learning (cs.LG) algorithms for improved feature matching and pose estimation. Additionally, the system involves online calibration and correction of camera poses, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
