The codes are also locally repairable, which involves the study of distributed storage systems (cs.DS). The construction of optimal codes involves combinatorial techniques, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper also presents new upper bounds on the length of the codes, which involves the study of coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the codes, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
