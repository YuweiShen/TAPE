The paper also focuses on multimedia content (cs.MM) and proposes a novel approach called content adaptive MAC (CAMAC) to mitigate interference. The paper uses stochastic-geometry models (cs.SI) to quantify the gain of CAMAC in content delivery networks. Finally, the paper discusses the distribution of shot-noise ratio, which is a mathematical problem and falls under the domain of graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
