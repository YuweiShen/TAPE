The use of machine learning techniques to predict diseases is a common application of CS, and the paper specifically mentions the use of deep learning models.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses AI techniques to predict Alzheimer's disease based on EHR data. The use of AI in healthcare is a growing field, and the paper specifically mentions the use of graph neural networks, which are a type of AI model.\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential impact of its approach on clinical care for Alzheimer's patients, which falls under the domain of computers and society.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques to extract information from EHR data, which falls under the domain of computation and language.\n5. cs.DB (Databases): The paper uses EHR data, which is a type of database, to predict Alzheimer's disease. The paper also mentions the use of graph structures to represent the relationships among different diagnoses, lab values, and procedures, which is a common application of graph databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
