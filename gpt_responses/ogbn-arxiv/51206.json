The use of probabilistic embeddings also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on different benchmarks, which could suggest the use of multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
