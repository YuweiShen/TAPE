The paper also mentions the difficulty of involving hackers in controlled experiments, which suggests a focus on practical and empirical studies rather than theoretical ones. This aligns with the programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories, which often involve practical implementation and experimentation. Finally, the paper discusses the creation of stronger code protections, which is a topic that falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
