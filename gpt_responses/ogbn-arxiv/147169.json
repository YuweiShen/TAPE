This involves the use of multiple antennas and a mix of multiuser and single-user detection schemes at the receiver. The paper is likely to fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), multimedia (cs.MM), communication (cs.COMM), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
