However, given the focus on DNN models and their efficiency, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of weight pruning and quantization techniques suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
