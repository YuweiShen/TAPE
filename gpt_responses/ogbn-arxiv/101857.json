These techniques are commonly used in the field of robotics (cs.RO) for motion planning and control. The paper also mentions the use of Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) search, which is a popular search algorithm in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of perception for terrain information, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of experimental trials to demonstrate the performance of the planning approach, which is a common practice in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
