The use of clusters and coordinators also suggests a focus on distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems). The performance and scalability analysis may fall under the category of performance evaluation (cs.PF). Finally, the use of protocols and algorithms may also relate to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
