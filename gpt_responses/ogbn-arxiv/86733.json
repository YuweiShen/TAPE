This falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses approximation schemes for problems in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and combinatorics (cs.DM), as well as complexity theory (cs.CC) in terms of proving equivalences between problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
