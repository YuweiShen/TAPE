The paper presents a new algorithmic approach to the problem in an online setting, which involves both geometric and combinatorial aspects. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
