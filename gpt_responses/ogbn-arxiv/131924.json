The proposed method involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM) and the paper discusses the importance of learning deep features, which is a topic in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses security concerns, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR).
