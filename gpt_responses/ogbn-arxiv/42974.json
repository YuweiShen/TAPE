The paper also mentions the use of Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs), which are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) commonly used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI, followed by cs.LG, which deals with ML and deep learning techniques. The paper also focuses on processing large knowledge graphs, which falls under the category of databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper evaluates the embeddings on tasks such as question answering and triplet classification, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
