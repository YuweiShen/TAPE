This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of hardware implementation, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The proposed algorithm also involves categorizing image blocks into edge, smooth, and disordered areas, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper mentions the suitability of the algorithm for embedding in medical hardware instruments, which could involve neural engineering (cs.NE) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
