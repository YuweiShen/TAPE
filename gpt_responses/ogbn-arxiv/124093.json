The paper also discusses the impact of hardware impairments on the proposed scheme, which is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system design that involves controlling the directions of users' channel vectors using IRS, which is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme can be used for multimedia transmission, as it can serve more users on each orthogonal spatial direction than spatial division multiple access (SDMA).\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves designing a computational system for IRS-NOMA transmission, which is relevant to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
