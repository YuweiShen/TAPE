It relies on the notion of substitution sequence to model the result of the execution of a goal. The paper discusses the denotational concrete semantics, a safe abstraction of the concrete semantics, and a generic abstract interpretation algorithm. The paper also provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of the approach. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). However, the paper also discusses logic and semantics (cs.LO), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and symbolic computation (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
