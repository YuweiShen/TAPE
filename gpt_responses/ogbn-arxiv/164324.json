The approach proposed involves formulating the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is a common optimization technique in control systems (cs.SY) and operations research (cs.MA). The paper also mentions the use of simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
