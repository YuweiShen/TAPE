The use of a rate-splitting approach to tackle multiuser interference is also related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper specifically focuses on the large-scale array regime, which is a topic related to massive MIMO (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel framework for hierarchical-rate-splitting, which is a topic related to communication and networking (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
