The paper proposes a new algorithm that uses nonconvex optimization techniques to recover a sparse signal vector from magnitude-only measurements. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses spectral procedures and hard thresholding based iterations, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper showcases simulated tests, which suggests that it may also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
