Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also discusses the accuracy of the BCI paradigm, which suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper involves the implementation of a VR system, which could be relevant to cs.GR (Graphics). The use of a smartphone-based head-mounted VR device could also be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia), and the evaluation of subjective factors could be relevant to cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
