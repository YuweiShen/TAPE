The language design focuses on addressing the problem of potentially infinite computation in cyclic dataflow networks, which is a topic in computer architecture (cs.AR) and systems engineering (cs.SE). The language also has a synchronous mode of propagation, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
