The paper also focuses on improving the efficiency and flexibility of the network, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a new approach to combining different types of connections in neural networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on several datasets, which is a common practice in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
