This involves the use of multiple stream 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on different views and time resolutions of the region adaptive depth motion maps. The paper also includes dedicated 3D CNN streams for multi-time resolution appearance information (RGB). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
