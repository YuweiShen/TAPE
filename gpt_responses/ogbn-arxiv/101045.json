The paper also mentions that approximant bases arise in most of the fastest known algorithms for linear algebra over univariate polynomials, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of certificates for verifying the correctness of the output is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper mentions the potential applications of the problem in cryptography, which could place it in the category of networking and security (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
