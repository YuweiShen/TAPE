Information theory is often used in the analysis of wireless networks. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel Poisson hole process (PHP) modeling of wireless networks and considers a more general hole shape to capture the spatial separation between tiers in a millimeter wave (mmWave) heterogeneous cellular network (HCN). \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper incorporates blockage and directional beamforming in the network model, which are important aspects of control in wireless networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis of a millimeter wave (mmWave) heterogeneous cellular network (HCN), which is a type of wireless network that can support high-bandwidth multimedia applications. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper considers the distribution of small cell BSs (SBSs) and macrocell BSs (MBSs) as a PHP and Poisson point process (PPP), which can be seen as a type of multi-agent system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
