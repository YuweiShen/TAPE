The paper discusses the challenges of using the primal-dual $\\pi$ learning method with deep neural networks and proposes a relaxed Lagrangian formulation with a regularization penalty using the advantage function to address these challenges. The paper also compares the proposed method with the actor-critic method, which is a popular reinforcement learning method. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
