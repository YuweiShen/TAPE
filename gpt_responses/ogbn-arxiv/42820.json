The paper also discusses the use of feedback to guide the adaptation process, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm is designed for use in conjunction with SARSA, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm commonly used in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses convergence properties and potential to reduce VF error, which are topics commonly studied in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which is a common approach in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
