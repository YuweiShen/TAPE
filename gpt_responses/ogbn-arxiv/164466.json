This topic is closely related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the need for a platform that utilizes memory, storage, and processing resources, which falls under the category of operating systems (cs.OS). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for a scalable and future-defining system, which could be related to the field of architecture (cs.AR) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
