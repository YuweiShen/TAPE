This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses different fading distributions and antenna directionality, which are concepts related to information theory. \n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper deals with the issue of signal outage and interference in mmWave networks, which are topics related to communications and networking. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a cooperative approach to improve coverage probability in mmWave networks, which can be seen as a control system. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of highly directional transmissions in mmWave networks, which can be related to multimedia applications that require high data rates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
