This involves smart contracts and private channels for confidential data communication, protocol enforcement, and an automated audit trail. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a blockchain-based framework for managing and monitoring data in multi-site clinical trials, which involves ensuring data integrity and privacy. This aligns with the focus of the cs.CR sub-category on cryptographic protocols, network security, and privacy-enhancing technologies.\n\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the use of a central database in traditional data management approaches for clinical trials, and proposes a blockchain-based alternative. This relates to the cs.DB sub-category, which covers topics such as data modeling, query processing, and data privacy.\n\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed data management framework based on blockchain technology, which involves multiple sites and stakeholders. This aligns with the focus of the cs.DC sub-category on distributed systems, parallel computing, and cluster computing.\n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the challenges and costs associated with multi-site clinical trials, and proposes a blockchain-based solution that could reduce administrative burden, time, and effort. This relates to the cs.CY sub-category"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
