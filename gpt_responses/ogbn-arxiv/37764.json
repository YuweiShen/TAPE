The paper discusses the interpretation of stochastic regularization using a Bayesian model and analyzes the relation between predictive uncertainty and variance of prediction scores obtained by stochastic inferences. The proposed algorithm improves classification accuracy and alleviates overconfidence issues in deep neural networks. Given these topics, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
