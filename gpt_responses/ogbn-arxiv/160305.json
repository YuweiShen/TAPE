The combinatorial characterizations of orderability for various graph classes suggest that the paper also falls under discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of equation systems to describe HR-equational classes of graphs suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC). The consideration of special graph classes such as split graphs and cographs suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.DS, cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
