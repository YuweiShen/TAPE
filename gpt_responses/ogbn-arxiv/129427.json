The proposed method is based on a neural network architecture, which is a common approach in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of local attributes of text instances, such as center line, scale, and orientation, which are common features used in computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of text recognition, which is a common task in information retrieval and natural language processing. Therefore, the paper could also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. \n\nThe paper deals with the problem of recognizing text instances in natural scenes, which is a common task in natural language processing.
