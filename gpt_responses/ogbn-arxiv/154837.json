This involves the use of partial differential equations and multiple observation data. The proposed architecture is fully convolutional and low-weight, which suggests a focus on machine learning and neural networks (cs.LG). The use of domain knowledge and isolated process representations for verification suggests an interest in interpretability and explainability (cs.SI, cs.AI). The focus on dynamic processes and system anomalies suggests a potential interest in control systems (cs.SY) and neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
