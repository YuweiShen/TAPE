It proposes a method called TGMiner to mine discriminative patterns from system logs, which can be used as templates for building more complex queries. This work involves techniques from graph mining, temporal data analysis, and system security. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
