It also talks about the need for efficient planning for a VOD system network. This makes cs.NI the most likely category for this paper. \n\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper talks about the multimedia services provided by NGN, which supports high definition TV (HDTV) and DVD quality video-on-demand content. It also discusses the merging of computing, communication, and broadcasting in the video services. This makes cs.MM a likely category for this paper. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the network architecture of a VOD system, which can be either centralized or distributed. It also talks about the need for efficient planning for a VOD system network. This makes cs.DC a likely category for this paper. \n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents different estimations for the different topologies of a VOD system network. It also talks about the network traffic models developed to evaluate the VOD system's operational bandwidth requirements. This makes cs.DS a possible category for this paper. \n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper talks about the need for"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
