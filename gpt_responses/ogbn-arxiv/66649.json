Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel approach using zone segmentation, which involves modeling and classification techniques, making cs.IR and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the use of HMMs and PHOG features suggests that cs.AI is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
