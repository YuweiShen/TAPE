The paper also discusses a distributed optimization setting, which falls under the subfield of distributed computing (cs.DC). The analysis of without-replacement sampling involves ideas from transductive learning theory (cs.DS) and adversarial online learning (cs.IT). Finally, the paper provides convergence guarantees for stochastic optimization, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
