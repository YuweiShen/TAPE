Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses parallel algorithms and their performance, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of different methods for wedge aggregation and vertex ranking indicates that the paper could also be relevant to cs.PF (Performance) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
