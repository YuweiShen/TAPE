The use of the Koopman operator for linear identification is a technique that has gained popularity in recent years in the machine learning community, particularly in the areas of dynamical systems (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of linear least squares, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning and falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
