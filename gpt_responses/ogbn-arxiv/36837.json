This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) domains. The paper also introduces a novel switching mechanism for addressing the depiction-specific and depiction-invariant aspects of the problem, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper uses experimental results to compare SwiDeN with alternative architectures, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
