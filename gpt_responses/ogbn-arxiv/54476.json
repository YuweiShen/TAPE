The paper focuses on the scenario when the amount of background data is large, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also proposes a novel theoretical result for characterizing the tail probability of the proposed statistics, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of cs.ST (Statistics). The paper uses a change-of-measure technique, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also applies the proposed method to high-dimensional data, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
