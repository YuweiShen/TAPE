The use of neural networks and conditional random fields also suggests that the paper may fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) subfields. The mention of human detection boxes and graph inference suggests that the paper may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
