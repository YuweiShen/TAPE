Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the optimization of the phase shift of each element on the reflect-array, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of reflect-arrays for signal enhancement and interference cancellation is related to cs.MM (Multimedia), as it involves improving the quality of wireless transmissions. The paper also proposes a new solution for spectrum sharing, which can be considered as a system-level approach falling under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of the proposed solution without any modification of the hardware and software in the users' devices, which is related to cs.CE (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
