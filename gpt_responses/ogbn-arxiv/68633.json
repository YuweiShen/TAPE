This topic is closely related to distributed computing (cs.DC), cryptography (cs.CR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and information theory (cs.IT). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper, with cs.DC being the most likely due to the focus on distributed systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
