The paper also discusses the use of second-order optimization methods, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments involve image classification, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the analysis of connections to second-order optimization methods suggests a potential application in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
