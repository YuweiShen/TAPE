The paper also introduces a regularized version of an evolutionary algorithm and compares it to a reinforcement learning baseline, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning also suggests the possibility of the paper being categorized under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques to improve the performance of the discovered models, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
