The paper proposes a new concept based on multidimensional persistent homology to analyze the conditions on which a clustering model is capable of generalizing data. The paper also introduces a more general definition of the data clustering problem by relying on topological spaces. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
