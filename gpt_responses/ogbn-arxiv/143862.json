The paper specifically focuses on the temporal features of the Open Annotation data model and the Memento framework, which are relevant to the areas of digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), web architecture (cs.WEB), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and computational linguistics (cs.CL).
