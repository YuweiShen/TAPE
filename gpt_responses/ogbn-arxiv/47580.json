The paper specifically focuses on using a two-head deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and maximizing the discrepancy between the two classifiers to detect OOD inputs. This work involves techniques from computer vision (CNNs), machine learning (OOD detection), and potentially cybersecurity (preventing applications from being used for other-than-intended purposes). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper involves detecting and preventing potential attacks on the system, it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
