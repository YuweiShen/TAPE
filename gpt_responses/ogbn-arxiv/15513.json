Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of multimodal calculi, which are relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves the use of sequent calculus and hypersequent calculus, which are topics in theoretical computer science, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the structural rules of the Lambek calculus, which is a topic in formal language theory, making cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
