This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with multi-relay networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also mentions techniques of antenna disablement and symbol extension, which are commonly used in Signal Processing (cs.SP) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a general method for solving matrix equations, which could also place it in the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
