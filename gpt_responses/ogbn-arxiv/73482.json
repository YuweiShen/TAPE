The paper proposes a new MAC scheme to address this issue. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new framework for cognitive radio networks that involves predicting interference levels and optimizing area spectral efficiencies, which can be seen as a control problem. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - While not the main focus of the paper, the proposed MAC scheme could potentially improve the performance of multimedia applications in cognitive radio networks by increasing spectral efficiency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
