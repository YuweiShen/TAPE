This involves the use of morphable voids and components to represent the geometry of the structure, which can be optimized using a small number of design variables. This fits well within the scope of cs.CE.\n\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the optimization of the geometry of shell-graded-infill structures, which involves the representation of the structure using morphable voids and components. This is related to the field of computer graphics, where the representation and manipulation of geometric objects is a key area of research.\n\n3. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a hybrid MMC-MMV approach for designing shell-graded-infill structures, which involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms. This fits within the scope of cs.MS, which deals with the development and use of mathematical software.\n\n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the optimization of the geometry of shell-graded-infill structures, which involves the representation of the structure using morphable voids and components.
