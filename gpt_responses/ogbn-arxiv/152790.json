The library is also flexible and can be applied to various optimization problems, which could fall under data structures (cs.DS) and computational engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the library can be used for machine learning algorithms, which could also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
