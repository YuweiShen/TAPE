The use of extractors is a common technique in computer science, particularly in the areas of randomness extraction and pseudorandomness, which fall under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper also touches on exposure resilient cryptography, which is a subfield of cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
