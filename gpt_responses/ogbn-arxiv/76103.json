The robot's hardware and controller design are available through open-source to facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots. The paper discusses the robot's mechanical and control design parameter space and its potential as a research tool to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. The paper also presents the robot's locomotion capabilities in several scenarios and discusses its customized actuators designed for robust actuation and efficient locomotion. The paper's content is relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
