The approach proposed in the paper involves using a multi-task network to jointly learn to clean noisy annotations and classify images, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The dataset used in the experiments is the Open Images dataset, which contains multiple annotations per image and over 6000 unique classes, making it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
