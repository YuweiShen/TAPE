It uses graph kernels to extract topological information from Twitter cascade structures and train predictive models to determine the veracity of rumors based solely on their diffusion patterns. This work involves social network analysis (cs.SOC), natural language processing (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.CR). The use of graph kernels and cascade structures suggests a focus on graph theory and algorithms (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper deals with the analysis of large datasets (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
