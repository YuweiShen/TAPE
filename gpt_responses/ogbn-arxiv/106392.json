The use of secret sharing in the computation also suggests a connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the transmission and processing of information securely. Finally, the assessment of performance and resource consumption may involve machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
