However, the focus on tracing and bundling research in the environment in which it takes place (e.g. one's computer or server) suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE). The use of cloud technology also suggests a focus on cybersecurity (cs.CR) and cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). Finally, the mention of ReproZip as a tool suggests a focus on programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
