It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses a multi-objective reinforced evolutionary search backend. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses neural architecture search to generate architectures. It also involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it uses a supernet to rank models. Finally, it may belong to the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category as it involves designing and evaluating neural network architectures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
