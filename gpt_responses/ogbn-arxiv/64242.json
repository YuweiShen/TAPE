The paper proposes a novel integer linear programming-based summarization framework that addresses the issue of high lexical diversity in such content. This framework involves a low-rank approximation to the sentence-word co-occurrence matrix to group semantically-similar lexical items. The paper conducts experiments on datasets of student responses, product reviews, and news documents, which are all related to natural language processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also uses a neural abstractive summarization system, which indicates that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves experiments on datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
