The codes are specifically designed for use in storage systems, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of 2D arrays to represent the codes, which is a topic in scientific computing and numerical analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of repair bandwidth, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
