The use of Markov blanket scoring and importance sampling also suggests a focus on probabilistic graphical models, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the QMR knowledge base of internal medicine mentioned in the abstract suggests a potential application in databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
