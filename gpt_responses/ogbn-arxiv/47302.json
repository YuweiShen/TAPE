Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves supervised classification and feature selection, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also deals with knowledge bases and corpus-specific features, which are relevant to database systems and information retrieval, respectively, making cs.DB (Databases) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves text analysis and classification, which are relevant to information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves statistical analysis and modeling, which are relevant to machine learning and data analysis, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
