This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA), Robotics (cs.RO), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). However, since the focus is on self-organizing systems, cs.MA and cs.RO are the most likely sub-categories. The use of local information and constant memory per particle suggests a focus on efficient algorithms, which also supports the inclusion of cs.DS. Finally, the mention of asynchronous rounds suggests a distributed computing perspective, which is relevant to cs.DC and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
