The paper also discusses the use of pathloss structure to reduce the amount of feedback necessary, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to allocate CSI feedback, which involves optimization and game theory, falling under the categories of theoretical computer science (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
