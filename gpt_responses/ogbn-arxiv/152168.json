The paper discusses the limitations of conventional extreme learning machines and recent cost-sensitive learning methods, and proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive extreme learning machine (ECSELM) that addresses the issue of defining the cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning tasks. The paper also introduces an ECSLDA method that couples with cost-sensitive subspace learning. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new machine learning algorithm and discusses the limitations of conventional machine learning methods. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper focuses on cost-sensitive recognition tasks in face recognition based access control systems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new algorithm that improves the performance of machine learning models in cost-sensitive tasks. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper introduces an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm for adaptive cost matrix optimization. \n- cs.SD (Sound): This is less likely, but the paper does not discuss any sound-related topics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
