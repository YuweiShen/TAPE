The focus is on developing a discrete-time channel model that considers the effect of filtering on the phase noise. This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of oversampling and multi-sample receivers, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper analyzes the capacity pre-log at high SNR, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
