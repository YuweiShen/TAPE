This involves encoding height map based local patches parameterized using 3D mesh quadrangulation of the low resolution input shape. The paper investigates both linear dictionary based model and convolutional denoising autoencoders based model for the task for inpainting, which suggests the paper could belong to sub-categories such as computer graphics (cs.GR), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
