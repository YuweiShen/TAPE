This algorithm uses a local, quadratic and time-dependent \\qfunc~learned from trajectory data instead of a model of the system dynamics. The paper also discusses the limitations of linear approximation of the system dynamics and proposes a policy update scheme that ensures exact KL-constraint satisfaction without simplifying assumptions on the system dynamics. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new model-free trajectory-based policy optimization algorithm that uses a learned \\qfunc~and discusses the limitations of linear approximation of the system dynamics. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new algorithm for control tasks that uses a learned \\qfunc~and discusses the limitations of linear approximation of the system dynamics. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a new algorithm for control tasks and discusses the limitations of linear approximation of the system dynamics, which are relevant to robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new algorithm for control tasks and discusses the limitations of linear approximation of the system dynamics, which are relevant to systems and control. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision or pattern recognition, the proposed algorithm could potentially be"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
