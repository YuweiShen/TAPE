The algorithm uses invariants to infer pre- and post-conditions, which suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of k-induction, which is a technique commonly used in formal methods and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper presents experimental results, which suggests a connection to formal methods (cs.FM) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
