The paper also introduces a new algorithm for computing roundtrip covers, which is a key concept in constructing roundtrip spanners. Therefore, the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
