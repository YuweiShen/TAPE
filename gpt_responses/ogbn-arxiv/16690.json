The proposed method involves signal decomposition and optimization, which are techniques used in machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of binary masks, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves solving a complex problem, which could fall under the category of algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
