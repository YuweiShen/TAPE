The paper also discusses privacy concerns and potential applications related to wearable cameras, which could potentially place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for identifying individuals in first-person videos, which could be relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category.
