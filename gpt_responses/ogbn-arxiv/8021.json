This involves trajectory optimization with respect to locally-linear time-varying models learned directly from sensor data, as well as deep learning and nearest neighbors methods for generalizing to a wider range of initial conditions. These topics are all related to robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
