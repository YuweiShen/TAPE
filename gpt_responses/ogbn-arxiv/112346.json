Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The use of neural models also suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with the challenges of developing NLP resources for a language with complex grammar and morphology, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
