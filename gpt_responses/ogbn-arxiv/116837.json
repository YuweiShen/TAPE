The use of deep learning also falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the efficiency gains of using automated methods for data extraction, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of camera traps and image analysis could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
