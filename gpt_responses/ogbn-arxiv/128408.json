This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with a distributed setting where multiple players share a common arm set and communicate with each other after some prescribed rounds. This falls under the domain of distributed computing. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a novel concept to measure the frequency of communication - the density of the communication set. This falls under the domain of information theory. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a system of multiple players interacting with a common environment and proposes a control policy to optimize their rewards. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel policy for the multi-armed bandit problem and studies the impact of communication on reducing regret.
