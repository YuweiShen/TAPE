The paper proposes a novel approach to generate high quality 3D pose ground truth given any in-the-wild image with a person inside, which involves the use of a neural network (cs.LG) and a carefully designed geometric searching scheme (cs.GR). The paper also evaluates the generalization ability of the proposed model, which involves the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and the analysis of quantitative and qualitative results (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
