The proposed method involves an iterative scheme that alternates between classification and introspection, which is a form of active learning and could be considered a form of reinforcement learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its method on several datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
