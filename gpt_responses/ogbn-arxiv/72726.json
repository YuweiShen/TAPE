It proposes a methodology for automatic prioritization of suspicious file artifacts using supervised machine learning. The paper involves techniques related to data extraction, feature extraction, and classification, which are commonly associated with computer security (cs.CR), data structures (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
