Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a multitask learning approach using deep neural networks, which falls under the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval as it deals with answering questions based on visual information, which falls under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
