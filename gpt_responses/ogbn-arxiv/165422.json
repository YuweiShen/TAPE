It also discusses the transmission of multiple sources over a network, which falls under the category of network information theory (cs.NI). The use of polymatroidal structures is a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper addresses the problem of transmitting independent sources over a multiple-access-type of network, which could be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
