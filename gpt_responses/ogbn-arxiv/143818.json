The codes are also designed to be delay-tolerant, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networked Systems (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of distributed space-time codes, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Computer Communications (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
