This work is relevant to machine learning and optimization, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.Optimization sub-categories. The use of limited memory BFGS Hessian approximations suggests relevance to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and the use of coordinate descent suggests relevance to distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper's focus on practical implementation suggests relevance to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
