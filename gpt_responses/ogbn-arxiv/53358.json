The paper also involves the use of randomization and analysis of random walks, which are techniques commonly used in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper's focus on analyzing the behavior of posterior intervals also suggests a possible fit in the Information Theory and Probability (cs.ITP) sub-category.
