The paper specifically focuses on exploiting the structure of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize exploration rates. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with regret lower bounds, which is a topic in optimization and decision theory, suggesting that it could also be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also deals with control and optimization of systems, which could lead to categorization under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
