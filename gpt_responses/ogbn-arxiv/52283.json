The use of policy gradient algorithm with an LSTM function approximation suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on real-world continuous control and navigation suggests that it may also belong to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of noisy observations and uncertain dynamics suggests that it may also belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
