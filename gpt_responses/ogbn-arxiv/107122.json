The paper also extensively uses AI-driven algorithms and techniques, such as Bayesian Optimization and Deep Distributed Policy Gradient, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also deals with data management and processing, which falls under the category of Databases (cs.DB). The paper also discusses the interplay of algorithms at multiple levels, which is a common theme in Software Engineering (cs.SE).
