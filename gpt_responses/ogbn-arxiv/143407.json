It also involves natural language processing techniques, which are commonly used in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The methodology proposed in the paper involves training and testing on large datasets, which could fall under the sub-category of Scalable Computing (cs.SI). The use of word embeddings and similarity scores also suggests a connection to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on social media and user-generated content could potentially fall under the sub-category of Cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
