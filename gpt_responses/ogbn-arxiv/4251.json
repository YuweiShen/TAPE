Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning, which falls under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of large datasets of images suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of images in political communication, which could fall under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) or cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
