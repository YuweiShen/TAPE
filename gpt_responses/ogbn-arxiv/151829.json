The paper also involves the use of machine learning models such as LSTM and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of LIME and Anchor explanations, which are popular methods in the field of Explainable AI (XAI), which falls under the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses the SNLI dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
