The paper specifically focuses on optimizing the performance of descriptor matching, which is a common stage in local feature based pipelines. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also uses deep neural networks to optimize the performance metric, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of listwise learning to rank approach, which is a common technique in information retrieval. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nThe paper evaluates its approach on standard benchmarks, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nFinally, the paper mentions that its approach achieves state-of-the-art results in patch verification, patch retrieval, and image matching, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
