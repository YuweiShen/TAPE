Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses cryptographic applications, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper involves the use of spectra semi-bent functions, which are related to combinatorial designs, indicating that it could belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves the use of Boolean functions, which are important in computer science, suggesting that it could belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper involves the use of explicit construction methods, which could be relevant to algorithm design, indicating that it could belong to cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
