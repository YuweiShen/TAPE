Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is a very likely sub-category. The paper also deals with programming languages and type systems, which suggests cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.TL (Programming Languages and Compilers) as likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses soundness theorems, which are a topic in software engineering, suggesting cs.SE (Software Engineering) as a possible sub-category.
