These technologies are driving a new vision of `networking as a service' (NaaS) in which networks are managed flexibly and efficiently cloud computing style. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses the impact of these technologies on the architecture and orchestration of network services, which suggests that it could also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. \n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions the symbiotic relationship between cloud computing, SDN, and network virtualization, which could make it relevant to the Cloud Computing (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for architectural and technological innovation, which could also make it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
