The use of structured encoding matrices and the proposed methodology for computing optimal coding rates suggest a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the discussion of realistic scenarios and 5G networks suggests a potential focus on social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
