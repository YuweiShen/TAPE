This involves solving a low-rank and sparsity constrained optimization problem for each view using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The approach is also extended to cluster data drawn from nonlinear subspaces by solving the corresponding problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Given these methods, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
