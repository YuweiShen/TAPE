The use of recurrent networks also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of benchmarks such as DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the mention of faster inference runtimes suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
