The paper proposes a deep learning-based CSI acquisition technique to accurately predict CSI entirely based on inertial sensor measurements at the transmitter, thus obviating the need for channel sounding. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their properties, including channel capacity, coding theory, and error correction. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of off-the-shelf motors and piezo transducers as vibration transmitters and receivers, respectively, to build a 2x2 MIMO testbed to collect and analyze vibration signals from real subjects. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of networked systems. \n\nThe paper proposes a deep learning-based CSI acquisition technique, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms to predict CSI. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. \n\nThe paper involves the use of experimental vibration data to show that Skin-MIMO can improve MIMO capacity by a factor of 2.3 compared to SISO or open-loop MIMO, which do not have access to CSI.
