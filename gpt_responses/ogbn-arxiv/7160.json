This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE), as DNNs are a key building block of these fields. Additionally, the paper mentions architecture-aware optimization, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
