The proposed algorithm is based on heuristic search and aims to maximize the amount of information collected during the configuration formation process, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.MA). The problem also involves energy budget constraints and optimization, which are common themes in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses experimental results and performance comparisons with other algorithms, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
