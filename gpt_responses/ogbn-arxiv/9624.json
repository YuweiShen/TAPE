The paper also proposes a novel algorithm that utilises boundary lines as the geometric structure of a human face, which involves machine learning techniques such as regression and heatmap-based methods, indicating that it could also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of datasets and the evaluation of the proposed method, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
