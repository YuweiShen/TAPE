This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the probability density function and outage probability, which are common topics in communication systems (cs.COMM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Monte-Carlo simulations, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
