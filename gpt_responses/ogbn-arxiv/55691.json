The paper also proposes a new privacy notion and mechanisms for input-discriminative protection, which involves machine learning and information theory concepts, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed mechanisms on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which could fall under the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
