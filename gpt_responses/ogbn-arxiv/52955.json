The paper discusses machine reading comprehension (MRC) models and proposes a new method for reframing MRC datasets as interactive, partially observable environments. This involves adding context-sensitive commands that reveal hidden text to a model, which can then seek relevant information through sequential decision making. This work involves natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), information retrieval (IR), and human-computer interaction (HCI), which are all relevant to the computer science sub-categories of \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language), \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence), \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval), \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning), and \"cs.HC\" (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
