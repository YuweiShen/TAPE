The use of sliding window decoder and stopping rule based on soft BER estimate suggests a focus on signal processing and communication (cs.SI). The comparison of computational complexity also indicates a possible interest in distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer networks (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
