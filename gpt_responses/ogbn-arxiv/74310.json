The focus on user-centric explanations and the consideration of trustworthiness, comprehensibility, explicit provenance, and context-awareness suggest a connection to Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The use of machine learning techniques and the need for explainability suggest a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG). The consideration of context-awareness suggests a connection to Cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the use of natural language processing techniques for generating explanations suggests a connection to Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
