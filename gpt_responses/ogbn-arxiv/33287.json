This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of \u03bbProlog in the context of automated reasoning and proof assistants, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses implementation issues and the development of an actual implementation of \u03bbProlog, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
