The paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for detecting paraphrases in short text messages, which is a common problem in social media and other user-generated content. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL and cs.LG, followed by cs.IR, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
