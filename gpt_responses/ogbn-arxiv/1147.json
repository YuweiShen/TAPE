This involves channel estimation and throughput fairness, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a low-complexity algorithm, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of MIMO technology in BSC also involves system optimization (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
