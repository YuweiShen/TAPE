This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the sample complexity of dictionary learning, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper includes numerical experiments on image data, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
