This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the performance of the optimized constellation over nonlinear satellite channels under additive white Gaussian noise. This falls under the domain of communication networks. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new labeling for the 4+12+16-APSK constellation of the DVB-S2 standard which is Gray over all rings. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper investigates the performance of the optimized constellation over nonlinear satellite channels. This falls under the domain of communication networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper compares the performance of the optimized constellations with the conventional Amplitude Phase Shift Keying (APSK) modulations used in the current digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-S2) on satellite channels. This falls under the domain of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
