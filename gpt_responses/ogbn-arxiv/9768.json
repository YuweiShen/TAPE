This suggests a strong connection to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper explores the design and deployment of autonomous systems, which could fall under the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The issues of privacy and security also suggest a connection to the Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories.
