The paper also introduces a new flow for generating nonlinear eigenfunctions, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of regularization functionals such as total-variation (TV) and total-generalized-variation (TGV) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
