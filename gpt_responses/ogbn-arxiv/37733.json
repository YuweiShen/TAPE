It proposes a graph-based approach to fully exploit the correlations among different attributes. The paper also utilizes the Graph Attention Layer (GAL) for exploring the most relevant attribute feature and refining the task-dependent feature by considering other attributes. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
