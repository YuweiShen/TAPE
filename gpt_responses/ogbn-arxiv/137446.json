Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. The paper also mentions the use of automatic diagram understanding and visual question answering, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper describes the annotation schema and the use of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for discourse relations, which are related to machine learning and natural language processing, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
