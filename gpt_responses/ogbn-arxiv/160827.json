The paper also mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for still image face recognition, which further supports the likelihood of it belonging to the cs.CV sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of machine learning techniques for feature aggregation, which could also place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of deep learning models for video processing could also suggest the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper involves the use of adaptive feature aggregation, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of deep learning models for video processing, which could also suggest the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
