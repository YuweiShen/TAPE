This involves using machine learning techniques to improve the prediction accuracy of the completed tensor with minimum sensor deployment cost. \n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the issue of reducing energy consumption in residential homes, which has societal implications for reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable living. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of collaborative sensing, where energy sensors are actively deployed to appliances from selected homes to improve the prediction accuracy of the completed tensor. This involves creating a network of sensors that work together to achieve a common goal. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for energy breakdown, which involves using AI techniques to improve the accuracy of the completed tensor. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the deployment of energy sensors to appliances in residential homes, which involves designing a control system to manage the deployment of sensors and optimize the prediction accuracy of the completed tensor."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
