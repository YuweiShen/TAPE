Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also discusses issues related to indexing and searching mathematical formulae, which could fall under cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques for faceted search, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
