The paper also analyzes the margin that data augmentation enforces on empirical risk minimizers, which is a concept in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper presents lower bounds on the number of augmented data points required for non-zero margin, which is a mathematical concept that is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
