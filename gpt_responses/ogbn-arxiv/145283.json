The paper presents a new compressed LCE data structure that uses the recompression technique, which is a powerful tool for compressed data structures. The paper is likely to be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
