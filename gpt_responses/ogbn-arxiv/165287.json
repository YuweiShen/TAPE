The proposed algorithms and techniques involve data structures, indexing, and optimization, which are typical areas of research in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DB (Databases), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
