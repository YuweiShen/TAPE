Specifically, the paper focuses on the relationship between entropy and successor surprisal effects in reading, which suggests that it may fall under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of an LSTM language model suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's focus on reading behavior and language processing may also suggest that it falls under the sub-category of cognitive science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
