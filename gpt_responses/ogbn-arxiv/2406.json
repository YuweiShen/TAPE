The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and 3D CNN for video analysis also suggests a strong focus on computer vision techniques. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with audio-visual data and proposes a new dataset for drunk person identification. This suggests a strong focus on multimedia analysis and processing. \n3. cs.SD (Sound): The paper deals with audio data and proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for audio analysis. This suggests a focus on sound processing and analysis. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a problem that has social implications, i.e., reducing traffic accidents caused by drunk driving. The proposed solution also involves the use of online sources for data collection, which suggests a focus on social and information networks. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques such as CNN and DNN for video and audio analysis, respectively. This suggests a focus on machine learning techniques for solving the problem of drunk person identification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
