Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of developing ML systems and the need for a unified approach, which could also place it in the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category. The use of Bayesian optimization and bandit learning for AutoML could suggest a connection to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions a variety of data modalities and problem types, including image, text, graph, tabular, relational, classification, regression, anomaly detection, and graph matching, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
