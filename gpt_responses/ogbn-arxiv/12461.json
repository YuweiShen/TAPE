The experiments conducted in the paper involve human subjects, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HCI). Additionally, the paper discusses regularizers that can be used to optimize for interpretability, which is a topic that falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of explanations in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which falls under the subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the design principles for explanation systems, which could potentially fall under the subfield of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
