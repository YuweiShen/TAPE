The paper also discusses the use of projections and transformations for computing such plans, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planners, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and planning (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the value of generalized representations for learning general policies, which is a topic relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
