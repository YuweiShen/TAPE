Additionally, the use of neural networks in the model further supports this categorization. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as entity disambiguation is a common task in information retrieval, and the paper discusses the use of a heuristic function to focus on the least confident local decisions. \n\nThe paper's use of a global view point and search in the space of possible corrections could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). \n\nFinally, the use of Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) in the model could suggest a categorization in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as LDS is a search algorithm that is often used in evolutionary computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
