The paper proposes a new loss function for this task, which involves designing a piece-wise loss function and a boosting strategy, both of which are related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also uses data augmentation approaches, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the experimental results obtained on two datasets, which involves evaluating the performance of the proposed method, and this is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
