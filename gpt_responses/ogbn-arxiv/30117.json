The use of LZ77 parsing suggests that the paper may belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The mention of theoretical guarantees and computational complexity suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. The experimental results suggest that the paper may belong to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories, as these sub-categories often involve empirical evaluations of algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
