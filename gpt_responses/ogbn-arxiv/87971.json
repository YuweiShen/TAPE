The experiments are conducted on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN), which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) is another relevant sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of function-preserving transformations, which is a technique commonly used in transfer learning (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves training multiple neural networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and the use of large datasets, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
