The focus on crowdsourcing and the need for robust estimators suggests that cs.DB (databases) and cs.AI (artificial intelligence) are likely categories. The use of human workers also suggests cs.HC (human-computer interaction) as a possible category. The need to extrapolate from small gold-standard datasets suggests cs.IR (information retrieval) as a possible category. Finally, the use of statistical techniques for estimation suggests cs.LG (machine learning) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
