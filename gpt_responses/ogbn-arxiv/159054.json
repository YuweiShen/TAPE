This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with analyzing and classifying multimedia content, specifically images and videos. This makes cs.MM a likely category as well. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, for image classification. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with automatically detecting and isolating questionable images in media, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. This makes cs.IR a possible category. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with detecting and isolating pornographic content, which can be seen as a security concern for children and minors. This makes cs.CR a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
