This involves the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to map the depth images to complex wireless channel estimations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of communication systems and their properties, including channel coding, modulation, and channel capacity. The paper's focus on wireless channel estimation makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the study of computer vision and image processing techniques. The paper's use of depth images obtained from surveillance cameras makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category deals with the study of computer networks and their properties, including protocols, architectures, and performance analysis. The paper's focus on wireless communication and its reliability makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of machine learning algorithms and their applications. The paper's use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to map depth images to wireless channel estimations makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
