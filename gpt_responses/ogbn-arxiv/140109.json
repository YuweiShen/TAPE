These tasks are typically associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) research. The paper also discusses the use of detailed maps to improve the accuracy of these tasks, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL) who are interested in incorporating external knowledge sources into their models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
