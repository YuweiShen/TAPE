The paper uses convex programming to disentangle signal and corruption, and analyzes both penalized and constrained programs. The paper provides conditions for exact signal recovery from structured corruption and stable signal recovery from structured corruption with added unstructured noise. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SP), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
