Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also presents a reconfiguration algorithm, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics). The use of SDN and the proposed monitoring scheme also involves information technology (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the security aspects of the proposed scheme, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
