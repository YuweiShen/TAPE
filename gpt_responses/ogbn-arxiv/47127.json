The authors use statistical models to represent the body shape and pose of infants, which falls under the category of machine learning (LG). The paper also discusses the applicability of their method in clinical practice for early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders in infants, which relates to healthcare (HC) and graphics (GR) as well.
