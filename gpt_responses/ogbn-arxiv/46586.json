The use of massive MIMO technology is a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it could also be classified under the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also involves optimization techniques and control policies, which could place it under the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with video streaming, which could potentially place it under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
