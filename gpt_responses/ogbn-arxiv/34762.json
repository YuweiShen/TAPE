It may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category as it discusses the process of resource blocks (RBs) selection and random access in each virtual vehicular network, which involves information theory concepts. Additionally, it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category as it proposes a novel framework for M2M communications in VANETs with WNV, which involves control and optimization techniques. It may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category as VANETs are vulnerable to security threats, and the proposed framework may have security implications. Finally, it may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category as the virtualization of the physical vehicular network involves distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
