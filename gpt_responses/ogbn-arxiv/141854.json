Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces novel data structures and algorithms for compressing and querying repetitive string collections, which involves techniques from data structures (cs.DS), deep learning (cs.DL), databases (cs.DB), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
