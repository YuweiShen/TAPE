The proposed method involves separating the answer from the passage and using a keyword-net module to better capture key information in the target answer. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under arXiv sub-categories such as cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
