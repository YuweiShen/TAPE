The paper focuses on the use of model-predictive control (MPC) to control the high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of these robots. This topic is closely related to the field of robotics (cs.RO), as well as systems and control (cs.SY), mechanical engineering (cs.ME), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
