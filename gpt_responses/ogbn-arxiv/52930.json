The use of linear codes for constructing designs is a topic in coding theory (cs.IT), and the Assmus-Mattson theorem is a well-known result in this area. The paper also discusses punctured and shortened codes, which are common techniques in coding theory. The link between designs and differentially $\\delta$-uniform functions suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper mentions the production of new designs, which falls under the category of combinatorics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
