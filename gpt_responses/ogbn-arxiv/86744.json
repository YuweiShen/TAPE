The paper also introduces strategies to accelerate the production of free-viewpoint videos, which involves graphics rendering techniques and falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the use of a volumetric visual hull approach, which is a common technique in the field of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of an efficient connected components labeling algorithm, which is a common technique in the field of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a view-dependent rendering approach, which involves machine learning techniques and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
