It also involves image processing and feature importance values. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a practical approach to interpret decisions made by a DNN object detector. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with deep neural networks. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it proposes a software tool that can be used for cluster processing. Lastly, it involves cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it proposes a potential extension of the E2X framework to overcome failures after model retraining."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
