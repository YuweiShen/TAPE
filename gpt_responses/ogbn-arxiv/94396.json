The use of optimization algorithms and the study of submodularity suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of experiments and interventions suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
