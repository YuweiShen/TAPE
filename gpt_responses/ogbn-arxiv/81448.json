The paper also proposes a novel approach that adaptively selects the input image scale to improve both accuracy and speed, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of their approach in autonomous systems such as robots and autonomous cars, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper evaluates their approach on datasets such as ImageNet VID and mini YouTube-BoundingBoxes, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
