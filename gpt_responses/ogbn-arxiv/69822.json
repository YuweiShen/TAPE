The algorithmic approach and numerical solutions suggest a focus on computer science (CS) sub-categories such as data structures (DS), discrete mathematics (DM), and computational complexity (CC). The paper also discusses applications and comparisons with known results, which could fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
