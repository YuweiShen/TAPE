Specifically, the paper focuses on the robustness of these attacks in an over-the-air scenario, which involves signal processing and communication aspects (cs.SD, cs.SY). The paper also employs techniques from natural language processing and audio signal processing (cs.CL) and uses a room-impulse-response simulator to harden the adversarial examples against varying room characteristics (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
