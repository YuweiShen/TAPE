The proposed algorithm uses Theory of Mind (ToM) and hidden Markov model framework to estimate worker intentions in real-time. The paper also discusses the use of virtual reality digital warehouse twins to simulate worker behavior in larger warehouses. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
