The paper also mentions the integration of the CEGAR principle, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of inference rules and analysis of different cases suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the experimental evaluation of the performance of the algorithm suggests a focus on computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
