The paper also discusses the comparison of different interleavers in terms of search complexity and error rates, which falls under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). The use of permutation polynomials for interleaving is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also presents a theorem and discusses the distance spectrum of polynomials, which are topics related to algebra and number theory (cs.DS, cs.NT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
