The paper also involves the use of semidefinite relaxations for edge-expansion, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the study of isoperimetric constants for these graphs connects to computational geometry (cs.CG). Overall, the paper's focus on graph theory and its applications to various areas of computer science make cs.DM, cs.CC, cs.IT, cs.SI, and cs.CG the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
