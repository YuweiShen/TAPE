It uses the Niederreiter cryptosystem and low-density parity-check codes, which are commonly used in cryptography. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes in the LEDAkem system, which is a topic related to information theory. \n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the decoding algorithm used in LEDAkem, which is designed to provide faster decoding than the classical bit-flipping decoder. This is a topic related to computational complexity. \n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the security implications of LEDAkem, including the potential for quantum attacks. This is a topic related to the societal impact of computer science. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper provides performance figures for an implementation of LEDAkem, which is a topic related to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
