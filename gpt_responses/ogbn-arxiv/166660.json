The paper also discusses the use of domain-decomposition techniques, which could fall under the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) category. Additionally, the paper mentions the reduction in run-time, which could be related to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper discusses the ability to extend the model beyond the domain(s) on which it has been trained, which could be related to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
