This involves the use of artificial noise to reduce the received SNR at eavesdroppers and increase the harvested energy. The problem is non-convex and is converted into a convex one using Charnes-Cooper Transformation and SDR. The paper involves optimization, information theory, and communication systems, which are all covered under cs.IT. The use of SWIPT and power splitting scheme falls under cs.NI and cs.SY. The paper also deals with security and privacy, which is covered under cs.CR. Finally, the use of Gaussian randomization method for constructing rank-one solutions falls under cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
