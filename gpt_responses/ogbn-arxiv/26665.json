The use of codes to guarantee reliable communication suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY), while the investigation of feedback for quantized CSI points towards networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the comparison of EIO rates with a mismatched ML decoder involves statistical signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
