This involves jointly learning feature extraction and separation estimation steps, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of raw video demonstrations also suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The paper also discusses the use of reward estimation, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is applied to control policies, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the method in comparison to existing techniques, which suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
