This is a problem that falls under computational geometry. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions the theory of highest weight vectors from representation theory, which is a topic in systems and control. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses numerical methods for classical problems in invariant theory, which is a topic in numerical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
