This makes it highly likely that the paper belongs to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes new architectures that can be seen as discretizations of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which suggests that it may also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also deals with reducing the computational cost of CNNs, which is a common problem in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper proposes new architectures that involve sparsity structures, which suggests that it may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
