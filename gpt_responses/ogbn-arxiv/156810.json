The method is applied to image classification and object detection tasks (cs.CV), and involves learning a small set of parameters to specialize to each task (cs.LG). The paper also discusses improving transfer learning accuracy by re-learning existing low-parameter layers, which could fall under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
