The paper also investigates the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor models and autoencoder models for the sequential generation of missing or dysfunctional limbs. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Robotics (cs.RO), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
