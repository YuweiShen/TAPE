The paper proposes a deep learning approach to address the problem of appearance change due to illumination, which is a common problem in computer vision and image processing, and hence, it is likely to be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves training deep convolutional encoder-decoder models, which is a machine learning technique, and hence, it is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on synthetic RGB-D datasets, which is a common dataset used in computer vision and robotics, and hence, it is likely to be categorized under computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
