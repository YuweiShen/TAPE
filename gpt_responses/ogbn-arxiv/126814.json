It focuses on generating long-term symbolic plans from high-dimensional observations, which is a problem commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method also involves planning in a simulated environment (cs.RO) and learning from visual inputs (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the real-world applicability of the proposed method, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
