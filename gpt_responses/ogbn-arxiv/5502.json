The paper also discusses the impact of noise on image quality, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper uses experiments with synthetic and in vivo datasets, which suggests that it could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
