The proposed model also involves attention mechanisms and gated orthogonalization, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG). The task of generating descriptions from structured data also has relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
