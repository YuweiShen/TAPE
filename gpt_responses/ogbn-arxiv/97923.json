Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel framework that incorporates meta-learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of artificial intelligence for plant disease diagnosis also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of gradient descent-based methods, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of noisy labels, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
