However, the main focus of the paper is on the information theory aspects of the problem, such as the capacity of the channel and the distribution of the residual self-interference. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
