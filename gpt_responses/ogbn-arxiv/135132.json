It also discusses optimization techniques for power allocation and time sharing. These topics are typically studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), communication systems (cs.COMM), signal processing (cs.SI), networking (cs.NI), and mathematical optimization (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
