It proposes a self-supervised inverse dynamics model to learn a visual feature space and formulates curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in that space. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for exploration in reinforcement learning, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with reinforcement learning and exploration, which are subfields of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised model, which is a common technique in computer vision.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's approach can be applied to robotic systems that need to explore their environment and learn skills.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's approach can be seen as a control problem, where the agent tries to minimize the error in its predictions and maximize its curiosity-driven exploration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
