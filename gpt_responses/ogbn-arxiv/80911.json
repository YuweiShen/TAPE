This is a key aspect of distributed computing, making cs.DC the most likely category.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper focuses on building an infrastructure and associated web-based tools to enable users from different backgrounds to access data concerning different environmental issues. This involves computational science and engineering, making cs.CE a likely category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the need to integrate data from different sources and formats, which is a key aspect of database management. This makes cs.DB a likely category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the benefits of cloud computing for resolving issues in environmental science, which has implications for society. This makes cs.CY a possible category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and deployment of a cloud-based infrastructure and associated web-based tools, which involves software engineering. This makes cs.SE a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
