Additionally, the paper focuses on fine-grained concurrency, which suggests that it may also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The examples used in the paper involve locks, which are commonly used in operating systems (cs.OS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
