The paper also discusses the use of Euler operators, which are commonly used in discrete mathematics and combinatorial topology, which fall under cs.DS. The paper also discusses the use of multilinear transformations, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the approach to various types of cell complexes, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
