The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods for creating physical adversarial stop signs, which could fall under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the need for robustness to various distortions, which could relate to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
