It also discusses the use of SDN control to install, update, and reconstruct monitoring rules in the switch data plane. \n\nIt could also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it addresses the issue of monitoring tasks introducing non-trivial overhead to network devices and proposes a solution that balances measurement load and guarantees system scalability. \n\nThe sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY) is also a possibility as the paper proposes a distributed and collaborative monitoring system that utilizes centralized SDN control. \n\nThe sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) is relevant as the proposed system is distributed and collaborative, and aims to balance measurement load across switches. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) could also be relevant as the paper proposes the use of novel two-stage Bloom filters to represent monitoring rules using small memory space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
