The paper specifically focuses on query-based summarization, which involves generating a summary based on a given query. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves information retrieval, as it aims to highlight relevant points in the context of a given query. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning and optimization, as it proposes a new attention model to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
