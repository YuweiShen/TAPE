The paper proposes a new method called IEG that is designed to be robust to severe label noise. The method is evaluated on several datasets, including CIFAR100 and WebVision, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the method is based on neural networks, cs.DL (Deep Learning) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper also discusses the problem of label corruption, which is a security issue, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
