The paper uses deep learning techniques to build a regression model for predicting visual search difficulty scores, which is a common approach in the computer vision community. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves human annotations and crowd-sourcing, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). \n\nThe paper uses machine learning techniques to analyze image properties that impact visual search difficulty, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also involves regression modeling and prediction, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFinally, the paper involves object localization and classification, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
