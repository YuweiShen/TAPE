This approach is applicable to any multi-task models with gradient descent as the optimiser, regardless of whether the prediction function is linear or not. The paper also discusses the potential for coKriging using this framework. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), social and information networks (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
