This involves selecting the next content item that will challenge the student but will not be overwhelming, keeping students in their Zone of Proximal Development. This work involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The system is designed to be used in educational settings, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and computer education (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper mentions natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques used to analyze student responses."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
