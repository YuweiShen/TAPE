The paper proposes a new locality-preserving write-only ORAM, which involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for storing and accessing data, making it relevant to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed solution on both rotational disks and SSDs, which makes it relevant to the category of databases (cs.DB) and operating systems (cs.OS). Finally, the paper proposes a full Linux kernel-level implementation of SqORAM, which makes it relevant to the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
