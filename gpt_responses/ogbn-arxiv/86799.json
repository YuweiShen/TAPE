It also mentions the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and \"Next Sentence Prediction\" tasks from BERT, which are commonly used in NLP research. The paper also involves training vector representations for each level of the text hierarchy, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of an adversarial model for long text generation suggests a potential application in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions improving the coherence of generated text, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
