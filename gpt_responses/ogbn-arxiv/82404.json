The optimization framework proposed in the paper involves optimizing transmit and receive beamformers, which is a common problem in network optimization (cs.NI). The paper also establishes new feasibility results for partial IA, which is related to signal processing and optimization (cs.SI). The simulations conducted in the paper involve evaluating the performance of the proposed framework in terms of network-wide utility, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
