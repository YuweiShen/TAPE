This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with finding hidden information in a large set of data. This can be considered as a form of information retrieval. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with analyzing data to find patterns and make predictions. This falls under the domain of databases. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper deals with using data mining techniques to improve the performance of an institution. This can be considered as a form of computational science. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a machine learning technique to predict student performance.
