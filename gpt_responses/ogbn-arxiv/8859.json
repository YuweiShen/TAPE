It also focuses on providing real-time user experience, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper proposes a multi-task learning framework, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also reports state-of-the-art results, which is a common theme in machine learning and computer vision research (cs.LG).
