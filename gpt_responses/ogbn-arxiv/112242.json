The proposed architecture aims to address memory capacity and bandwidth challenges in DL tensor operations.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses a hardware/software co-design that involves a remote memory pool for GPUs, which suggests a distributed computing approach.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions recommender systems, which are commonly used in database applications. The proposed architecture aims to improve performance on state-of-the-art recommender systems.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper focuses on deep learning, which is a subfield of neural computing.
