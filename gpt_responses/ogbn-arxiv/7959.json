The specific application studied in the paper is the problem of secure estimation of a dynamical system, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the properties of wiretap channels, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The problem of estimating a dynamical system with nonstochastic disturbances involves signal processing and machine learning techniques (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the zero-error capacity of channels, which is a topic in information theory and communication complexity (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
