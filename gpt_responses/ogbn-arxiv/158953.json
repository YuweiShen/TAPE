The Simplex Algorithm, Network Simplex Method, and Successive Shortest Path Algorithm are all well-known algorithms in this field. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of problems that can be solved by the algorithms, including NP-hardness results. This is a central topic in computational complexity theory. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with discrete optimization problems, such as network flows and linear programming, which are studied in discrete mathematics. \n4. cs.NE (Networks and Economics): The paper discusses network flows and earliest arrival flows, which are important topics in network optimization and transportation planning. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper mentions the Simplex Algorithm being used in game theory, which is a subfield of computer science that studies strategic decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
