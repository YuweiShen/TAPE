This falls under the area of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the complexity classes characterized by these systems, which falls under computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions syntactic restrictions on the rewriting systems, which falls under formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
