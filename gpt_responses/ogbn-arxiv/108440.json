The paper also discusses the use of statistical methods for estimating these measures, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of confidence bounds, which is a topic that falls under the category of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides examples that show that similar results hold for mutual information and relative entropy, which are also topics in information theory and machine learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
