The use of quantization and graph traversal to refine similarity estimation also suggests a computer vision application. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with similarity search, which is a core problem in information retrieval. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of regression codes suggests a machine learning approach. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with indexing images, which is a multimedia application. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The use of graph traversal and compact representations suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
