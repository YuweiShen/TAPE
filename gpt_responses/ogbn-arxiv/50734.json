This involves formulating and adding constraints to the model to extract more specific patterns. The use of interactive solving is also mentioned. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI, followed by cs.DB and cs.DM. The paper also involves experimentation with real datasets, which could fall under cs.LG or cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
