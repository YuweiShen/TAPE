This involves adapting an Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique from the discipline of (probabilistic) grammar induction. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on intelligent agents, machine learning, planning, and reasoning, which are all relevant to the proposed method. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of machine learning, including probabilistic models and EM techniques, which are used in the proposed method. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of robotics, including planning and control, which are relevant to the proposed method. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of systems and control, including planning and optimization, which are relevant to the proposed method. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of natural language processing and computational linguistics, which are relevant to the use of context-free grammars in the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
