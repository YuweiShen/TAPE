The use of disagreement-based active learning and rejection rates also suggests a possible categorization under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The mention of rejection rates in the context of image classification also suggests a possible categorization under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of Hanneke's disagreement coefficient and its role in the analysis of the algorithms suggests a possible categorization under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
