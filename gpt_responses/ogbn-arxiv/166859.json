The study uses bibliometric analysis to compare the productivity of new associate professors with incumbents in the hard science areas. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CY (Computers and Society) as the paper discusses the impact of university policies on scientific performance. The other likely sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the study uses bibliometric analysis to evaluate scientific productivity. Additionally, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are also possible sub-categories as the paper discusses the efficiency of the recruitment process and the desirability of providing selection committees with bibliometric indicators in support of evaluation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
