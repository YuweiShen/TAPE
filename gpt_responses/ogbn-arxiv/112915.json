The proposed technique for filtering out chaotic activities also involves querying the event log data.\n- cs.LG: The paper proposes a novel technique for filtering out chaotic activities, which involves training a machine learning model to distinguish between chaotic and non-chaotic activities. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.CR: The paper discusses the impact of chaotic activities on the quality of process models, which is relevant to the field of computer security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
