The paper also discusses the use of random linear precoders, which falls under the category of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper's focus on security and cryptography also suggests that it could be categorized under cs.SI (security and privacy) or cs.CC (cryptography and security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
