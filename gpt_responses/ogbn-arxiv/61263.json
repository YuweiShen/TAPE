The methodology proposed in the paper involves utilizing the structure of the network and backpropagating explanations, which are common techniques used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of nonlinear methods such as deep neural networks, which is a topic covered in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
