The use of multiple servers for computation suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The optimization of communication rate and server observations suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of aligned secret sharing schemes suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the use of matrix multiplication in data analytics suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
