The use of pretrained CNN models and feed forward neural networks for classification tasks suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of neural networks for classification tasks also suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper deals with image analysis and classification, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with medical imaging, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
