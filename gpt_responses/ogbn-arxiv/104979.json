It also utilizes hierarchical policy classes, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category as it deals with learning policies over long time horizons, which is a key problem in AI. The paper may also be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) category as it discusses planning over different time scales, which is important in robotics. The use of expert demonstrations and the empirical evaluation on benchmarks such as Montezuma's Revenge suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
