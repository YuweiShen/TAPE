This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the application of these statistics in system design, which could be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of MIMO technology, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
