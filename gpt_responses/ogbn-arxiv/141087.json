However, since the paper focuses on the security aspect of distributed computing, cs.CR and cs.DC are the most likely categories. The use of codes and linear computations also suggests that cs.IT and cs.LG are possible categories. Finally, the mention of delay reduction and optimization suggests that cs.SY is a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
