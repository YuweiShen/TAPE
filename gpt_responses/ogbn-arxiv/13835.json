The paper also discusses the scoring formula for verification systems, which could be relevant to logic in computer science (cs.LO) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Additionally, the paper addresses the comparison of verification effort between systems, which could be relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
