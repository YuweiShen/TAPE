Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of features and optimization of models, which are related to artificial intelligence (AI) and information retrieval (IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the fusion of interdisciplinary knowledge and experience, which falls under the scope of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
