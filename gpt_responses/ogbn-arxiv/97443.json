The paper also proposes a new architecture for partial sum computation units, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and embedded systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper discusses the overall system design and optimization, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
