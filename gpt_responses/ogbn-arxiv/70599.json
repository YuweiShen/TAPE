The proposed algorithms involve decentralized decision-making and coordination among the robots, which suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of a topological map and obstacle avoidance also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper presents simulation and experimental results, which may involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for robot perception and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
