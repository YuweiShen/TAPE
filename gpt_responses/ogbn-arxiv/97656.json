The focus is on the argumentation processes leading to negotiated solutions in multi-speciality meetings. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category, as it deals with the interaction between humans and technology in a collaborative design process. Additionally, the paper discusses the software engineering (cs.SE) aspect of the design process, as well as the social and information networks (cs.SD) involved in the collaborative design activity. The paper also touches upon the cybernetics (cs.CY) and computer engineering (cs.CE) aspects of the design process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
