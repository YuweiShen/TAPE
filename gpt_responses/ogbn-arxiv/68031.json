The paper proposes a new method for sentiment analysis that utilizes deep neural networks, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.SI).
