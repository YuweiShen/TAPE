The paper presents three calculi and establishes their meta-theoretic properties, which suggests a focus on logic (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the sensitivity of the relative expressiveness of user-defined effects to language features, which could be relevant to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and theoretical computer science (cs.THEORY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
