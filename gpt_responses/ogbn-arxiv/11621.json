The proposed method involves encoding spatial constraints and optimizing them using nonlinear least squares, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the integration of a one-stage prediction structure and a post-optimization module, which could involve natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) for ensuring run-time efficiency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
