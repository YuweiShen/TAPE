The paper also introduces a new class of loss functions that could potentially improve convergence rates, which could be of interest to researchers in information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper specifically mentions computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as domains where deep learning has achieved impressive results, indicating that these sub-categories are also relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
