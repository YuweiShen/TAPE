This involves image analysis, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of deep learning and neural networks for automated diagnosis falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.DL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) in terms of developing an annotated dataset for training the deep learning model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
