Additionally, the use of gradient-based neural architecture search and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The optimization techniques used in this work may also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the application of the optimized architecture to disparity estimation suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
