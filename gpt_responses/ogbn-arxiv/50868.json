Additionally, the paper focuses on the potential for physical denial-of-service (PDoS) attacks, which involve the physical disruption of cyber-physical systems (CPS). This makes the paper relevant to the sub-categories of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also uses game theory to analyze mechanisms for deterring botnet recruitment, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper uses a Poisson signaling game, which is a type of stochastic game, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
