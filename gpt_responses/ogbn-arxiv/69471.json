The paper also proposes a statistical method to uncover the underlying latent semantic structure in the embeddings, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the interpretability of the embeddings, which could fall under the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Software Engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
