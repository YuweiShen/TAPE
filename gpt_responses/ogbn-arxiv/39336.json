The use of clique arrangements and their characterization of strongly chordal graphs suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the application of these concepts to the recognition of leaf powers may also make the paper relevant to computational complexity and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
