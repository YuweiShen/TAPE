The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as word2vec and GloVe, which are commonly used in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a postprocessing technique to improve the performance of these techniques, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The empirical validation of the proposed technique on multiple datasets and languages also suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
