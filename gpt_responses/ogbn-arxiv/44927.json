This involves using machine learning algorithms to iteratively select the most informative game configurations to test, reducing the amount of human playtesting required. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of machine learning algorithms to automate game parameter tuning, which falls under the domain of AI. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper is about game design and playtesting, which is a topic that falls under the intersection of computer science and game theory. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses active learning techniques to automate game parameter tuning, which is a machine learning task. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the potential for automated playtesting to reduce the human burden of performing playtesting, which is a topic that falls under the domain of HCI. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): While not directly related to social or information networks, the paper does discuss the use of automated methods to gather feedback about game design elements, which could be seen as a form of network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
