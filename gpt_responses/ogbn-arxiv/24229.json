The paper also discusses the impacts of period length and channel utilization fairness, which are related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and control systems (cs.SY). The simulation and experimentation aspects of the paper may also fall under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
