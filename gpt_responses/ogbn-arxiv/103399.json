This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The paper proposes a new representation called the higher-order network (HON) that can discover and embed variable orders of dependencies in a network representation. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the scalability and compatibility of HON with existing network analysis methods, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of Software Engineering (cs.SE) or Computer Engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper presents empirical evaluations and analyses, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Statistical Learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
