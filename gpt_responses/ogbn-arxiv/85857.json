This suggests a focus on database systems (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for developing analytical tools. The emphasis on ease of installation and use suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computer engineering (cs.CE) for practical implementation. The mention of a graphical user interface also suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.DL) for visualization and user interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
