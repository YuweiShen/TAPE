The paper proposes a meta IRL algorithm that models the reward function for each task as a distribution conditioned on a baseline reward function shared by all tasks and dependent only on the demonstrator. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.RO (Robotics)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision)\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
