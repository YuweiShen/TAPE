The use of meta-features and learning quasi-transitivity also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of large unlabelled collections and the need for efficient retrieval suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as another likely category. Finally, the use of the YouTube database suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
