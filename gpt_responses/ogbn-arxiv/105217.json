Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new approach for multi-face alignment, which involves clustering and mapping landmarks to a high-dimensional space. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper mentions practical applications of multi-face alignment, such as face recognition and face tracking, which could also place it in the cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
