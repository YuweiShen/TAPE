The language also involves querying large collections of process models, which may require efficient database management (cs.DB). The paper also mentions the use of behavioral predicates and formal proofs, which are common in programming language design (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the language's performance involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
