The use of multiplane image (MPI) scene representation and plenoptic sampling theory suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The practical application of the approach in an augmented reality smartphone app and viewers also suggests that it may belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of deep learning and the focus on perceptual quality suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper's emphasis on prescriptive sampling guidelines suggests that it may belong to the geometric topology (cs.GT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
