The paper also proposes a novel framework that utilizes graph convolutional networks, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of social relations between users, which falls under the category of social networks (cs.SOC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural models, which is a subfield of deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper deals with large-scale real-world datasets, which could fall under the category of scalable systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
