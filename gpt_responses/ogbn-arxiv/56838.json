The paper also introduces the concept of a semantic-effectiveness (SE) plane, which involves information filtering and control of functionalities, and is related to information theory (cs.IT), software engineering (cs.SE), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the SE plane can be seen as a core part of future communication architectures, which involves system design and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
