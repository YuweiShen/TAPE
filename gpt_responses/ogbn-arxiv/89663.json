The title suggests that the paper presents simple bounds, which could be related to coding theory (cs.CC). The use of the term \"smooth\" suggests that the paper may involve some form of optimization or smoothing techniques, which could be related to signal processing (cs.SI). The mention of block-lengths suggests that the paper may involve some form of data compression or multimedia processing (cs.MM). Finally, the use of the term \"capacity formula\" suggests that the paper may involve some form of network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
