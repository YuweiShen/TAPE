Additionally, the use of spatial attenuation context (SAC) module and end-to-end training are techniques commonly used in computer vision research. The paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as deep neural networks are a popular tool in these fields. The use of attention mechanisms in the SAC module may also suggest a connection to natural language processing (cs.NE) research. Finally, the use of benchmark datasets and experimental results may suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
