This technique is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications. The paper also discusses the interpretability of loss gradients, which is a topic of interest in explainable AI (cs.AI) and security (cs.CR) research. Additionally, the paper proposes potential approaches for resolving the trade-off between test accuracy and gradient interpretability, which is a problem commonly encountered in optimization (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
