The use of expected payoffs suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The problem of determining whether a joint strategy exists can be formulated as a decision problem, which is a typical topic in computational complexity (cs.DS). The paper also involves the analysis of the complexity of the problem, which is related to computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of a multi-agent system, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
