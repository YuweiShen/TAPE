It also involves learning from visual data and evaluating the model on pedestrian datasets. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new LSTM model for trajectory prediction. Robotics (cs.RO) is another likely sub-category as the model can be used for robot navigation in crowded spaces. Social and Information Sciences (cs.SI) is also a possible sub-category as the model can be used to study human behavior in crowded spaces. Finally, Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) is another possible sub-category as the model can be used to design better interfaces for human-robot interaction in crowded spaces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
