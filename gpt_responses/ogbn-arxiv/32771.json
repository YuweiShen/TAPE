Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of statistical body shape models could also place it in cs.GR (Computer Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves optimization and objective functions, which could place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
