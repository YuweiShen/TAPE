The use of ReLU units is also a popular choice in neural network architectures. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are the most likely categories. The paper also uses techniques borrowed from statistical physics, which suggests a possible fit with cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper's focus on the learning behavior of ReLU networks compared to sigmoidal networks may also fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
