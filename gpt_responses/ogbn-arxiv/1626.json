The paper also discusses scheduling and precoding techniques, which are relevant to Networked Systems (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI). The use of simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
