The use of ad-hoc regression branches and the elimination of a post-processing stage suggest that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the processing of LiDAR data, which could potentially fall under computational linguistics (cs.CL) due to the use of point clouds and spatial data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
