It investigates advanced sequence prediction models such as LSTM and GRU networks, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses feature selection, feature engineering, and model implementation, which are important topics in neural networks and data science (cs.NE, cs.SE). Finally, the paper provides a real-world application example for a large urban grid, which involves system-level analysis and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
