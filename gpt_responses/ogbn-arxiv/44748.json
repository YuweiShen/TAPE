The paper also discusses the interpretability and transparency of deep neural networks, which are important topics in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper conducts large-scale quantitative studies, which is a common practice in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also uses real human gaze data, which is related to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the alignment between artificial and human attentions, which is related to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
