The paper proposes a modification to the standard Bellman update to solve the Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) problem, which is a two-player game between a human and a robot. This modification reduces the complexity of the problem and allows for larger reward parameter spaces and action spaces. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) since it involves the interaction between humans and robots."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
