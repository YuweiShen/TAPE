The paper also discusses the mathematical properties of these measures, which suggests a focus on theoretical computer science. Therefore, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the effectiveness of centrality measures in information retrieval, which suggests a focus on information retrieval and search engines. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the properties of directed graphs, which suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures. Therefore, cs.SD (Software Development and Programming) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with social networks and their analysis, which suggests a focus on sociology and psychology.
