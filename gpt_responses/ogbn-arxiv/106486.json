The paper also considers the practical hardware impairments, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of hybrid digital analog (HDA) beamforming is a technique used in mmWave communication systems, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
