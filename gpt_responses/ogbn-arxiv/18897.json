This technique is embodied in a system called Mechanical Novel, which crowdsources short fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The paper also reports on a field experiment that compared Mechanical Novel to an iterative crowdsourcing workflow. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), as it deals with the interaction between humans and technology in the context of crowdsourcing. Other likely sub-categories include Computation and Language (cs.CL), Cybernetics (cs.CY), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Computational Complexity (cs.CC), as these areas are relevant to the techniques and experiments described in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
