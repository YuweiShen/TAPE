The resulting 3D models can be used for immersive experiences, which falls under graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of a novel architecture, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the goal of creating immersive historical experiences implies a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
