This approach is applicable to various domains, including software timing analysis, program synthesis, and controller synthesis for hybrid systems. Therefore, the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, such as Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Programming Languages (cs.PL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
