The paper proposes a novel technique for feature alignment and domain transfer, which involves deep learning methods, indicating that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper also involves large-scale datasets and experiments, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.GR (Graphics) sub-category.
