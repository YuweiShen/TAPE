It also involves the use of feedback, which is a common technique in coding theory (cs.CC). The self-reduction technique introduced in the paper may have applications in the area of data compression (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the concept of external information complexity, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper introduces a more general model of interaction over a noisy channel, which may be of interest to researchers in the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
