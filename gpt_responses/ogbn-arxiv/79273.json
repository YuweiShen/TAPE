This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses concatenated coding schemes, which can be categorized under coding theory (cs.CC). The use of interleavers and the potential for parallel decoding may also relate to topics in signal processing (cs.SI) and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
