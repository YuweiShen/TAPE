The paper also explores the issues of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI-based systems, which is a common topic in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of simulations to observe the impact of different user attitudes on trust dynamics suggests that the paper may also belong to the Cybersecurity (cs.CR) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on recommendation errors and their impact on trust dynamics suggests that it may also belong to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
