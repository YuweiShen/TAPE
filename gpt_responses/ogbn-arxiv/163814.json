It also presents a hardware-based approach for implementing a highly performant encrypted database index, which involves database systems (cs.DB) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The use of Intel's SGX also suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
