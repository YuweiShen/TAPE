The use of the RAM model with word length w suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also presents results on multi-pattern matching, which is a problem in combinatorics (cs.DM). The use of logarithmic encoding of characters and the analysis of query time suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents worst-case efficient algorithms, which may be of interest to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
