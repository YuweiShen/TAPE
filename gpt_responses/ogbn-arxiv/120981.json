The approach proposed in the paper involves studying the problem in the frequency domain, which suggests a potential connection to signal processing (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves optimization techniques to refine the blur kernel and estimate the sharp image, which could be related to graphics (cs.GR) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
