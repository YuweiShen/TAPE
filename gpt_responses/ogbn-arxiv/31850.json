Specifically, it focuses on the $\\mathcal{EL}$ logic and its extensions, which are commonly used in ontology-based data access and reasoning. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.DB are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves complexity analysis and algorithm design, which are relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the paper mentions OWL 2 EL, which is a standard for ontology representation and reasoning, suggesting that cs.DL (description logics) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
