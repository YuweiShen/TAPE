The paper proposes asynchronous stochastic proximal optimization algorithms with variance reduction, which involves optimization techniques and parallel computing, suggesting that it may also belong to the sub-categories of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) and \"Numerical Analysis\" (cs.NA). The paper also mentions the use of block partitions, which is a common technique in the sub-category of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms, which is relevant to the sub-category of \"Social and Information Networks\" (cs.SI) where the focus is on analyzing large-scale data sets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
