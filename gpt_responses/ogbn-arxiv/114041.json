Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also uses additive regression trees, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multi-class AUC, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications that involve ranking and classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
