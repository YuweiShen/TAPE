The use of a web interface and the discussion of a prototype implementation suggest a focus on human-computer interaction and programming languages. The paper also mentions the Coq standard library, which is a widely used proof assistant in the field of logic and automated reasoning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
