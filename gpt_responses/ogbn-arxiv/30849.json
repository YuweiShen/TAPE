It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it discusses the use of deep neural networks and their activation sparsity in reducing computation cycles and energy consumption. Additionally, it may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it proposes an end-to-end training algorithm for developing a lightweight run-time predictor. Finally, it may belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it discusses the design of a scalable architecture with distributed memories and processing elements connected through a dedicated on-chip network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
