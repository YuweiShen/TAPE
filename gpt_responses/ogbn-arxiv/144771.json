It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as event-based cameras are commonly used in robotics applications. The use of deep learning suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the development of new algorithms for event-based cameras suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
