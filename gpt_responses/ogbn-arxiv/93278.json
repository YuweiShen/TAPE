The use of a deep neural network for training suggests that it may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The game being studied involves imperfect information, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT). The use of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm suggests that it may also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the authors mention using computer vision techniques to extract features from the game state, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
