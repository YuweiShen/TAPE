This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the training procedure and balancing the learning, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the approach both quantitatively and qualitatively, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
