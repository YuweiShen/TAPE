The proposed method involves estimating pixel-wise non-uniform blur kernels to handle general and locally varying blurs caused by various sources, such as moving objects, camera shake, depth variation, and defocus. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves estimating optical flows to handle motion blurs, which suggests that it may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a single energy model that jointly estimates optical flows, defocus blur maps, and latent frames, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. \n\nThe paper involves optimizing the proposed energy model, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves extensive experimental evaluation on publicly available challenging video data, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
