This topic is closely related to the field of network infrastructure (cs.NI), as well as information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). Additionally, the paper discusses the physical properties of light-emitting-diodes and their modulation bandwidth, which falls under the category of physics (cs.PHYS). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential applications of VLC in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
