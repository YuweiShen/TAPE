The focus is on continuous control tasks, which are related to robotics and control systems, suggesting that the paper could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
