This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific application of the proposed technique is in computer vision (cs.CV) and statistics (cs.ST), where the authors use a Bayesian linear regression model with outliers. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization of proposal programs using inference compilation, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
