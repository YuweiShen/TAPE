This approach involves predicting how the agent got to the goal state, rather than just how to reach it. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, given the focus on reinforcement learning and the use of deep Q-networks (DDQN), cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
