The paper proposes a new approach to identify diverse collections of well-performing policies. This approach involves optimizing the difference between the distribution of trajectories induced by each policy, which encourages diversity with respect to both state visitation and action choices. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
