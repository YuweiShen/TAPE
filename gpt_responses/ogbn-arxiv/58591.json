The use of soft MMSE-based signal level combining technique and frequency domain processing also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the analysis of computational complexity and memory requirements may also be of interest to the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
