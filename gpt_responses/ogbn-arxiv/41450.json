The use of common randomness and the focus on privacy and security also make cs.ITP and cs.CR likely categories. The paper also involves statistical estimation and learning, which could place it in cs.LG. Finally, the paper discusses the use of polar codes, which could place it in cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
