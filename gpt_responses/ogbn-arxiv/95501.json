Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the impact of system and channel parameters on the effective capacity, which involves the study of network performance and optimization, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also uses mathematical expressions and functions, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.GN (General Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
