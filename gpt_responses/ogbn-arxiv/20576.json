The paper proposes a new method for compression of gradient differences, which involves communication and information theory (cs.IT) concepts. The paper also involves analysis of the convergence rates of the proposed method, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with distributed computing, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
