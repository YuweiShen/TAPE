It also involves the use of power constraints and coding schemes, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses achievable schemes and outer bounds, which are related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
