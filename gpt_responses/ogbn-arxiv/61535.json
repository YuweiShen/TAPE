It also compares NOOP to other domain-theoretic models of OOP, which is a common topic in the PL community. \n\nIt could also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category as it discusses the semantics of OOP and presents a new model for analyzing nominally-typed OO programming languages. \n\nThe Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper discusses the benefits of nominal-typing to mainstream OO developers and OO language designers. \n\nThe Types (cs.TY) sub-category is relevant as the paper discusses type inheritance and subtyping in statically-typed OO programming languages. \n\nFinally, the Computation and Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category is a possibility as the paper presents a mathematical model for analyzing nominally-typed OO programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
