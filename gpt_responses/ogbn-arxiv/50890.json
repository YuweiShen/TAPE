This involves a spatial modeling of online ensembles and the use of linear least squares (LSQ) solution, which is adapted for online environments. The paper uses real-world datasets and synthetic data generators using the MOA libraries to show the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as the paper deals with designing adaptive classifiers for evolving data streams. The use of spatial modeling and LSQ also suggests a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of ensembles and optimization techniques suggests a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
