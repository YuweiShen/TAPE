This suggests a strong computational engineering component to the work.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The use of a Finite Element solver and the development of customised post-processing and visualisation tools suggest a focus on numerical analysis.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a new toolset that had to be significantly more flexible and easier to maintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of development to be carried out by engineers with little training in software development. This suggests a strong software engineering component to the work.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The development of a plotting package based on numpy and matplotlib suggests a focus on mathematical software.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The use of Python as the main programming language for the toolset suggests a focus on programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
