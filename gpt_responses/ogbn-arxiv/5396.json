The experiments also involve testing the method on real images. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a descriptor-based matching scheme and sets up an integer quadratic problem to find a near optimal solution, which are common techniques in machine learning. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper deals with graph matching, which is a problem in discrete mathematics. The paper also discusses the stability of the proposed descriptors under small perturbations, which is a topic of interest in discrete mathematics. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Graph matching is a common problem in social and information networks, and the paper proposes spectral descriptors for this problem. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper deals with graph matching, which is a problem in computational geometry. The paper also discusses the pairwise heat kernel distance on edges, which is a topic of interest in computational geometry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
