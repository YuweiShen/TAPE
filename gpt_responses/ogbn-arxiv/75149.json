The use of deep learning models such as LSTM also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The evaluation of the proposed model on two datasets, including a new volleyball dataset, suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the focus on understanding human-level information for whole activity recognition suggests that it could belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
