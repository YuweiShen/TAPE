The paper also discusses the impact of physical channel models on the performance of the method, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and system optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the paper focuses on the performance of the method in the context of massive MIMO systems, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
