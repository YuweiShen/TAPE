The paper proposes a new objective called anchoring, which complements experience replay to address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. The paper also conducts experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for continual learning. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
