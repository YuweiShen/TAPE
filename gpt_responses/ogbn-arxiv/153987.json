Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of convolutional neural networks, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the estimation of scene transmission maps, which makes cs.GR (Graphics) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
