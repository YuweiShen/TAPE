This falls under the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a new update equation that generalizes three different families of learning algorithms, which is relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The proposed framework is evaluated on a sequential question answering dataset, which involves processing visual information, suggesting relevance to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
