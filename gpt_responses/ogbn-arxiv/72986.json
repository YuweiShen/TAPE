This is a core topic in machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Falling rule lists are inspired by healthcare applications, which is a common area of research in AI. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper mentions that falling rule lists are useful for stratifying risk sets, which is relevant to many applications in finance and engineering. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This is less likely, but falling rule lists could potentially be used in security applications for risk assessment or anomaly detection. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This is also less likely, but the paper mentions that falling rule lists are an alternative to traditional decision tree learning methods, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
