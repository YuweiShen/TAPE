The proposed approach involves using a system monitoring application to distinguish between different symptoms and trigger appropriate detection mechanisms, which requires techniques from software engineering (cs.SE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of an ensemble of detectors also involves techniques from data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the focus on mobile devices suggests a potential overlap with networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
