The use of non-additive iterate-dependent Markov noise is a specific and somewhat niche aspect of the paper, which could place it in the numerical analysis (cs.NA) or dynamical systems (cs.DS) categories. Finally, the paper also touches on information theory (cs.IT) in its discussion of the stationary distributions of the Markov noise."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
