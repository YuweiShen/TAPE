This involves local relative position measurements and does not require global position information or inter-vehicle communication. The paper also discusses the robustness of the approach to inaccuracies and effects of acceleration on gravitational measurements. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.MA), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
