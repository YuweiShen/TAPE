It proposes a new approach, Macneto, that uses deep learning and principal components on instructions to search for relevant programs. This work involves both computer security (cs.CR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses deep learning techniques. Additionally, it involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses principal components analysis. The paper also discusses the potential of Macneto to help developers understand executables, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
