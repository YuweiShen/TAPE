The paper proposes a novel approach for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that takes into account hardware diversity, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural engineering (cs.NE) fields. The paper also uses a coordinate ascent framework for the search, which is a technique commonly used in computer architecture (cs.AR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
