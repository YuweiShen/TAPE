The use of spin-based devices and Boolean satisfiability attacks suggests a focus on emerging technologies (cs.ET) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The discussion of layout camouflaging and invasive monitoring at runtime suggests a focus on computer architecture (cs.AR) and software engineering (cs.SE).
