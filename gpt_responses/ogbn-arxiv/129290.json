This approach is evaluated under the IEEE 1547, UL 1741 and multiple-DG operation. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hybrid approach for islanding detection of inverter-based distributed generations (DG) which involves the use of Slip mode frequency-shift (SMS) and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) relay. This approach is evaluated under the IEEE 1547, UL 1741 and multiple-DG operation. This work involves the control and monitoring of power systems, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n\n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper proposes a novel approach for islanding detection of inverter-based distributed generations (DG) which involves the use of Slip mode frequency-shift (SMS) and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) relay. This approach is evaluated under the IEEE 1547, UL 1741 and multiple-DG operation. This work involves the study of power systems and energy, which falls under the scope of power and energy. \n\n- cs."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
