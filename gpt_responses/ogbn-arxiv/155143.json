The paper proposes a coding scheme based on polar codes, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of LED lightings for VLC, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of forward error correction (FEC) codes, which is a topic in communication systems (cs.COMM) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents numerical results and discusses the efficiency of the proposed scheme, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
