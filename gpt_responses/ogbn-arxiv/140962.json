This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep neural networks also suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with the problem of limited ground truth data, which suggests that it may belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new principal component analysis based augmentation, which suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
