The focus on exploration and exploitation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of high-dimensional control tasks in MuJoCo simulator suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
