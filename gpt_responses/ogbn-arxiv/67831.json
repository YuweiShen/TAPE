Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses Fisher's information and minimum mean-square error, which are topics related to cs.MM (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Signal Processing), respectively. The paper also presents a new proof of the EPI, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
