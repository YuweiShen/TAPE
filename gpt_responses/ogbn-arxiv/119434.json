The paper also discusses the use of online adaptation and fine-tuning of the network, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of objectness, which is a concept related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method to robotics (cs.RO) for tasks such as object tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
