The use of algorithms and complexity analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of \"maximum leaf problems\" suggests that the paper may also be relevant to graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
