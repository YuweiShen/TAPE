Specifically, the paper focuses on the challenge of building robust word embeddings with sparse temporal data, which is a problem that is often encountered in NLP research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to research on NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also discusses different models for learning diachronic word embeddings, including incremental updating of a Skip-Gram, dynamic filtering, and dynamic Bernoulli embeddings. These models are all related to machine learning and statistical modeling, which are common topics in several other CS sub-categories. Therefore, the next most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also discusses the performance of different initialization schemes and the distribution of detected drifts, which are related to information retrieval and data analysis. Therefore, the next most likely sub-categories are cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
