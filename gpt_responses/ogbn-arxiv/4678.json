Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which focuses on the development of algorithms and models for learning from data. \n\nThe paper also introduces an operand for rapid computation in the framework of deep learning, which suggests a potential application in the field of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on reducing over-parametrization may also have implications for system and control theory (cs.SY), as it could lead to more efficient and effective control of complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
