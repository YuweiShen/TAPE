Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of mixed precision arithmetic and distributed computing, which falls under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also proposes a learning rate schedule, which is a common technique in optimization algorithms used in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
