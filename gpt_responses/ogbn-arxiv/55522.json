The proposed model leverages templates discovered from training data, which involves machine learning techniques and falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The model also involves selective encoding, which is a technique used in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the model uses bi-directional encoding, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
