The focus on network communities also suggests a potential fit for the social and information network sub-category (cs.SI). The use of adjusted rand index and normalized mutual information, which are commonly used in machine learning and data science, suggests a fit for the machine learning sub-category (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the difficulty of extending current formulations to overlapping cases, which suggests a fit for the data structures and algorithms sub-category (cs.DS). The focus on finding communities in complex networks suggests a fit for the social and information network sub-category (cs.SD) and the networking and internet architecture sub-category (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
