The paper also involves combinatorial results and graph theory, which are relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS). The bidimensionality theory, which is mentioned in the abstract, is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper's focus on graph classes and their properties suggests that it may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
