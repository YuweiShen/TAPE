The proposed algorithms are based on information-theoretic criteria and exploit the spatial correlation structure of the environmental phenomenon, which are typical techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithms are designed to optimize the trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency, which is a key issue in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes empirical evaluation on real-world data, which suggests a possible connection with computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
