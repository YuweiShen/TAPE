The paper proposes a new algorithm for jointly modeling labels and worker quality from noisy crowd-sourced data, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) research. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
