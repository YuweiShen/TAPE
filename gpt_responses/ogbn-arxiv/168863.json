This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) since preoperative images of the anatomy are used. The use of Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes for directing the probing and modeling the stiffness distribution suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of this technique to surgical navigation and intraoperative data fusion suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of surgical robotics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
