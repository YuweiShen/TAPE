This involves constructing DNN models for different layers of the HEC system and selecting the appropriate model based on contextual information. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper heavily relies on deep neural networks for anomaly detection, which falls under the machine learning domain.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with IoT data and proposes a solution for edge computing systems, which is related to networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's approach involves using AI techniques for anomaly detection, which is a subfield of AI.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Anomaly detection is an important aspect of security, and the paper proposes a solution for detecting anomalies in IoT data, which is related to cryptography and security.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper's approach involves distributing the anomaly detection task across different layers of the HEC system, which is related to distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
