The study also considers the impact of fading, which is a common phenomenon in electromagnetic (EM) waves, making cs.EM a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of system parameters such as center frequency and bandwidth, which are relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
