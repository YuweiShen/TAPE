The use of Gaussian process latent variable models (GP-LVM) and approximate inference algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques for motion planning, which could make it relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category.
