The specific application domain of the proposed dataset and benchmark is object recognition, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses different learning scenarios and proposes baseline approaches, which are typical topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques for data annotation, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
