The paper also discusses the construction of codes based on drawing codewords recursively, which is a topic in discrete structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the achievable error exponent and its tightness, which are topics in statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the optimality of certain choices of distance function, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
