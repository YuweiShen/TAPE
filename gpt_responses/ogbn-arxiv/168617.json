The proposed method involves deep learning and kernel-based methods, which are both subfields of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses the issue of training data imbalance, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a real-world dataset, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
