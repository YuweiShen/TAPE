The paper also applies the proposed method to Bayesian logistic regression and Bayesian neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.ML (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves statistical analysis and convergence rate analysis, which suggests the sub-categories cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
