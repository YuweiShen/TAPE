The study also involves user perception and preference, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of algorithms to optimize the placement of labels is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of images and annotations could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
