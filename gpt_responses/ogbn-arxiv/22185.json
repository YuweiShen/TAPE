This suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and decision-making (cs.DS), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE) for implementing the approach. The concept of flexibility also relates to control systems (cs.SY), which could be relevant for analyzing and optimizing decision-making processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
