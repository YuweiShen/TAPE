The use of low-resolution ADCs also involves system-level considerations and control (cs.SY). The paper proposes an algorithm for antenna selection, which involves optimization and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents simulation results, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or performance evaluation (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
