The use of a recursive algorithm suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper involves numerical computations, which could place it in the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the category of social and information networks (cs.SI), as self-dual codes have applications in network coding and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
