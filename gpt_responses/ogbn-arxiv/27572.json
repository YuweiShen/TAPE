This falls under the scope of computational linguistics.\n2. cs.LG (Learning) - The paper discusses the use of nonlinear connectives in TLG and provides a Curry-Howard labelling for them. This involves the study of logical systems and their computational properties, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes four conservative extensions of the displacement calculus with brackets, which can be seen as a form of knowledge representation in AI.\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper deals with the formalism of TLG, which can be seen as a programming language for natural language processing.\n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) - The paper discusses the structural properties of the universal and existential exponential modalities of linear logic (LL) in the context of TLG, which can be seen as a formal language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
