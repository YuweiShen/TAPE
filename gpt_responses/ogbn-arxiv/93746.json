The paper focuses on achieving optimal parallelism in a fully asynchronous message-passing model, which falls under the scope of distributed computing. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is widely used in machine learning for Bayesian inference and parameter estimation. The paper discusses the distributed implementation of this algorithm, which is relevant to the machine learning community. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a popular method for sampling from complex probability distributions, which is a common task in artificial intelligence. The paper's focus on distributed implementation of this algorithm is relevant to the AI community. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper presents a distributed algorithm for Metropolis-Hastings sampling, which falls under the scope of control systems. The paper's focus on achieving optimal parallelism in a fully asynchronous message-passing model is relevant to the systems and control community. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the communication complexity of the distributed Metropolis sampler and provides bounds on the number of rounds of asynchronous communications required for simulating $"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
