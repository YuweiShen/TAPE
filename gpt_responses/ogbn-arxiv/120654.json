This falls under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). The technique leverages crowdsourced knowledge from Stack Overflow, which involves natural language processing and information retrieval techniques (cs.IR). The paper also discusses semantic similarity and relevance between terms, which is a common topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the proposed technique aims to improve the search process for software developers, which can have implications for human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
