The use of post-mortem iris recognition in forensic analysis suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of a deep convolutional neural network, which is a popular machine learning technique (cs.LG). The experiments involve the use of a specific database, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the challenges of post-mortem iris recognition, which could be related to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
