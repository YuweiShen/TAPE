Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with NLP and its applications. The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques for developing the lemmatizer, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the development of rules for morphological analysis, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves the processing of text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
