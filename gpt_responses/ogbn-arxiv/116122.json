The proposed approach involves a dual representation of the subspace and an $\\ell_1$-minimization problem on the sphere, which suggests a connection to optimization and information theory. The experiments involve synthetic and real data, which suggests a connection to data science and statistics. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.IT (Information Theory). The sub-categories cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also possible due to the optimization and data analysis aspects of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
