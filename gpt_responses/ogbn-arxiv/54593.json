The paper also discusses the asymptotic analysis of the gap between the sum-rate and the maximal achievable total rate, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of outer bounds, which is a technique commonly used in computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
