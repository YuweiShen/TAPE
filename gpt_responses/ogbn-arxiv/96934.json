The paper also introduces a novel Fourier analysis technique, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents new bounds for the location of satisfiability thresholds, which could be considered a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
