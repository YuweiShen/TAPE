This involves exploiting external knowledge graphs and balancing between external and old knowledge to perform well on new data. The paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new learning method that integrates GCN into a topic model and learns the networks and the topic model simultaneously for data streams. This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with learning hidden topics in data streams, which is a natural language processing task. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a method for topic modeling, which is a common technique used in information retrieval. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves exploiting external knowledge graphs to improve topic modeling, which is related to social and information networks. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel method for learning hidden topics in data streams, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
