The paper also involves complexity analysis and the study of redundancy properties, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) due to its analysis of the complexity of the novel redundancy properties."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
