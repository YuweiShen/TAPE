The use of graph convolutional networks for texture refinement is a recent development in the field of deep learning, which suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The use of a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based method also suggests that the paper may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of generative networks and large-scale databases suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of facial details from the input image suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
