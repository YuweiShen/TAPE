Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the adaptation of the algorithm to different search space characteristics, which suggests it could also fit into cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of metaheuristics and optimization algorithms could also place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
