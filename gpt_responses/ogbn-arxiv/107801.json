The paper also discusses optimizing the network for energy consumption, which is related to embedded systems (cs.EM). The use of classifiers of varying complexity is a form of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a principled optimization algorithm, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) or computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
