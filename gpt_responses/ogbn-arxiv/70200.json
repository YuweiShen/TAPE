This suggests that machine learning techniques could be used to improve the initialisation or to learn better models for the IK problem. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The IK problem can be seen as a control problem, where the goal is to find the joint angles that best explain the observed joint locations. The proposed convex optimisation approach could be seen as a control strategy to achieve this goal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
