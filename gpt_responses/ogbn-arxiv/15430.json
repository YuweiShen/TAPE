The specific application of the method to fMRI analysis suggests a possible fit with neural engineering (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of convex optimization and error bounds may also suggest a connection to optimization and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
