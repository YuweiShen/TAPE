It proposes a new method based on bidirectional random walks to compute specificity and extract entity-specific substructures for RDF graph embedding. This work involves techniques from Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for machine learning, Database (cs.DB) for KGs, and Learning (cs.LG) for vector representations. It also involves Information Retrieval (cs.IR) for entity recommendation and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) for graph analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
