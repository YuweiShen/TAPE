It is related to well-studied problems such as index coding with side information and generalized guessing games. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also discusses the storage capacity as an information-theoretic analogue of the minimum vertex cover of a graph, which suggests that it could belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses a general method of \"gadget covering\" to upper bound the storage capacity, which is a technique commonly used in Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
