This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Game Theory sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses correlated equilibria and achieving higher expected utility, which are relevant topics in AI research. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The notion of exchangeable equilibria involves conditional independence and identically distributed variables, which are concepts commonly used in machine learning. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions a version of the \"revelation principle\", which is a concept in mechanism design and can be related to data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses equilibria in games, which can be applied to social networks and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
