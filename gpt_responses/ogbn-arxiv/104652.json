The paper specifically focuses on transferring knowledge from a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for deployment on embedded systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. The paper also involves training and optimization techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SD (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper involves neural networks, which could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
