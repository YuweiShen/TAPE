This involves searching for roles and relationships within sentences, which is a common task in information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). The proposed indexing scheme and coding scheme are designed to improve querying performance, which is a key concern in database systems (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential for improved search effectiveness, which is a common goal in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
