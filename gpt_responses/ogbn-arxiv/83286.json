This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed network has been trained using curriculum learning, which involves gradually increasing the difficulty of the training samples, and this falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the problem of text detection in degraded images, which falls under the domain of image processing and retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
