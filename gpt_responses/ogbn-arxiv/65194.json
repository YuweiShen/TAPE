The use of Channel State Information (CSI) and singular value decomposition also suggests a possible fit for the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The discussion of worst-case decoding complexity and the use of precoding techniques may also make this paper relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of M-QAM constellations and the use of multiple antennas suggest a possible fit for the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
