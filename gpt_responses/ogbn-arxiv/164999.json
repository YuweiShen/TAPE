The paper also discusses the operational significance of column-distance and column-span metrics, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.DS) and information theory. The paper proposes a new class of codes and establishes an information theoretic upper bound, which are typical contributions in coding theory and information theory. The paper also includes numerical simulations, which are commonly used in computer networks (cs.NI) and communication systems (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the operational significance of the proposed codes, which is relevant to systems and implementation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
