This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a low complexity method for channel estimation, which could fall under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses computational complexity, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
