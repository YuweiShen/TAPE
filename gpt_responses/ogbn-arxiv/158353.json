The use of LDPC codes and the connection established between Slepian-Wolf coding and channel coding suggest that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Coding Theory (cs.CC), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), or Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
