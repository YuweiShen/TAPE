The use of bi-Lipschitz extensions also suggests a possible connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the applications of the results to prioritized and terminal dimension reduction problems suggest a possible connection to machine learning and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
