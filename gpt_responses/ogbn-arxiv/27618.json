This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of Belief-Desire-Intention agents and the focus on critical scenarios suggest that the paper may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories.
