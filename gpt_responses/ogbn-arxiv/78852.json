It also involves the use of algorithms and optimization techniques (cs.IT) to improve TCP performance. The paper specifically focuses on data centers (cs.DC) and the challenges of high bandwidth-delay product networks, which is a common issue in data centers. Finally, the paper proposes a new congestion control algorithm that aims to improve network stability and efficiency, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
