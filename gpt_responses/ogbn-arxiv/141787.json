Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents simulation results on synthetic and real-world images, indicating that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
