The proposed method involves joint optimization of feature aggregating and hashing, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of label vectors for supervised hashing, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). The experiments involve benchmark datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
