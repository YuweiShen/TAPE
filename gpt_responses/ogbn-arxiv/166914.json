The proposed method involves kernel descriptors and multiple kernel learning, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the influence of image styles on object recognition, which relates to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments involve post-processing of images, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves comparing the proposed method to standard descriptors, which could be considered a form of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
