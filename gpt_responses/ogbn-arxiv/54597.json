The proposed regularized form of principal component analysis (PCA) involves regularization techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) to improve the accuracy of the estimates. The experiments conducted on synthetic and real data involve statistical analysis (cs.ST) to compare the performance of the proposed approach with pre-existing factor analysis approaches. Finally, the paper also discusses the computational requirements of the proposed algorithm, which relates to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
