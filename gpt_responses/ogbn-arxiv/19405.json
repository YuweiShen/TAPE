The paper discusses the use of mobile platforms for local businesses to connect with potential customers and offer affordable advertisement channels. The paper also discusses the collection of a large time-series dataset from Foursquare and the use of randomization techniques and hypothesis testing for analyzing the performance of such campaigns. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of classifiers for predicting the success of special offer campaigns, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.MA (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
