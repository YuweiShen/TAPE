The use of the extended Kalman filter is a common technique in estimation and control (cs.CV), and the paper specifically focuses on the use of the filter on Lie groups (cs.LG). The problem of tracking objects with direction measurements also has applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), particularly in the field of computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
