The paper also discusses the issue of intellectual property protection, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper leverages both traditional and deep spatial invisible watermarking mechanisms, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for protecting deep learning models, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
