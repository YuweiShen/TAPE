Additionally, the use of Attentional Encoder-Decoder Recurrent Neural Networks is a common technique in this sub-field. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe use of novel models to address critical problems in summarization suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper involves modeling the hierarchy of sentence-to-word structure, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new dataset and establishes performance benchmarks, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
