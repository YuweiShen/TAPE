The paper deals with open domain factual Arabic question answering using Wikipedia as the knowledge source. This involves challenges related to annotated QA datasets in Arabic, large scale efficient information retrieval, and machine reading comprehension. These challenges are typically addressed in the fields of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE).
