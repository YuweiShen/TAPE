This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a centralized optimization problem that can be solved using distributed algorithms. This involves the use of optimization techniques and algorithms, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) to solve the optimization problem. ADMM is a popular optimization technique used in machine learning, making cs.LG a likely category.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed algorithm to solve the centralized optimization problem due to the privacy concerns and distributed topology of the power system. This falls under the domain of distributed computing, making cs.DC a likely category.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a scheduling problem for prosumers in the smart grid, which involves the use of computational techniques to optimize energy consumption.
