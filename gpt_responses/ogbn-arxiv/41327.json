The use of multiple measurements and parallel channels is a common technique in signal processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses power allocation strategies, which are relevant to communication networks (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents optimal distortion performance, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
