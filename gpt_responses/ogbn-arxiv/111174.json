This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, given the focus on graph processing and join optimization, cs.DB and cs.DS are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
