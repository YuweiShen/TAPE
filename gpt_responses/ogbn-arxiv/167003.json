The paper proposes a data-driven approach to learn local feature representations and associated metric functions for 3D geometry matching. The paper also uses deep learning with convolutional neural networks directly in 3D. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.GR (Graphics). \n\nThe paper also proposes a way to automatically generate correspondence labels for deep learning by leveraging existing RGB-D reconstruction algorithms, which involves machine learning techniques. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also demonstrates the robustness of the proposed descriptor in a purely geometric sparse bundle adjustment pipeline for 3D reconstruction, which involves robotics and control. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics and Control) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a novel approach to handle noisy and partial scanning data, which involves artificial intelligence techniques. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
