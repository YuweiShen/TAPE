The proposed method involves the use of a cascaded Convolutional Neural Network, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of multi-task learning and end-to-end learning, which are common approaches in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of feature maps, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the network, which involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
