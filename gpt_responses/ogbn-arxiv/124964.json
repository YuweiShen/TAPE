The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper proposes a novel explanation method using influence functions to understand the prediction of trained LFMs. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with recommendation systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the interpretability of LFMs, which is a topic in social impact (cs.SI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
