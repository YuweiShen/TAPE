The paper also proposes algorithms for computing imperfect-recall abstractions, which involves clustering and metric spaces (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.DS). The paper also discusses the practical usefulness of the abstraction techniques, which falls under the category of applied machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
