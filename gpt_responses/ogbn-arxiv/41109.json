The paper focuses on scalable semi-supervised learning from data associated with a collection of graphs, which is a key problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The TGCN architecture is designed to discover complex and highly nonlinear data associations, which is a common goal in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also considers graph-based regularizers to promote smoothness and alleviate over-parameterization, which is relevant to the sub-field of statistical inference (cs.SI). The proposed architecture is scalable and robust to perturbations on the graph edges, which is relevant to the sub-fields of data structures (cs.DS) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
