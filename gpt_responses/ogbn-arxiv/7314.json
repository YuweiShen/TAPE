Specifically, the paper discusses the interpretation and limitations of existing measures of uncertainty, proposes a new measure of contradiction, and introduces a degree of specificity based on the distance between a mass and its most specific associated mass. These topics are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
