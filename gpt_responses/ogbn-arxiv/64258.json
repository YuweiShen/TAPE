The use of paragraph structure is a novel approach that can be applied to various NLP and IR tasks, such as document classification and summarization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and speech processing. The paper also involves statistical modeling and machine learning techniques, which are common in sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of structured documents and the exploration of semantic properties of paragraphs can also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
