This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes models based on explicit object information, which suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves measuring the upper-bound performance of the models using gold standard annotations, which suggests that it may belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
