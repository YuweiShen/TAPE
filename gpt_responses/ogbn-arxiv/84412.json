The paper proposes a new RL problem and introduces new objectives and architectures to address the problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the main category for papers on RL and generalization. The paper also deals with natural language instructions, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with 3D domains, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
