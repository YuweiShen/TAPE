The paper focuses on the properties of symbol locality and group decodability, which are important for efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of data transmission and storage. Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), as these fields are also relevant to distributed storage systems and their optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
