Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is a likely sub-category. The problem also involves statistical inference and estimation, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as possible sub-categories. The proposed methods involve analyzing the autocorrelation of the signal and using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm, which are techniques commonly used in signal processing and statistical inference. This suggests cs.SI (Signal Processing) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with a specific problem of detecting multiple copies of a signal with an arbitrary spacing distribution, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
