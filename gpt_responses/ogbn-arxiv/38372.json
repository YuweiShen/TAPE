The paper also introduces a novel co-attention mechanism to capture global correlations and scene context, which involves training a neural network to jointly compute and append co-attention responses into a joint feature space. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on three large benchmarks, indicating that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
