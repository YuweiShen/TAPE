The paper focuses on the safe interaction of humans with robots, which is a key area of research in robotics. The paper uses torque sensors located in the robot's drivetrain to enable the full-body detection of external forces. The paper also uses model-based techniques to estimate the location, direction, and magnitude of collision forces. The paper then develops an admittance controller that achieves a low effective mass in reaction to these forces. The paper presents experimental testing with a calibrated collision dummy and a holonomic mobile platform. The paper also presents a proof of concept experiment where various parts of the mobile platform, including the wheels, collide safely with humans. Based on the above, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
