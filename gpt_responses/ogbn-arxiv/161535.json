The paper also involves considerations of compression and leakage rates, which are related to information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the privacy constraint on the enrolled source data suggests a potential connection to the subfield of cybersecurity (cs.CY). The optimal tradeoff analysis in the paper may also involve machine learning techniques, which could place it in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study of the connection between the secret key rate and security of the authentication system could potentially fall under the subfield of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
