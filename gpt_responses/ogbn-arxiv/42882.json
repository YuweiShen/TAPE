The use of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and ellipsoidal bounds also suggests a connection to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. The simulations involving a platoon of vehicles suggest a connection to the cs.RO (Robotics) category. The use of artificial limits on actuators to prevent dangerous states from being reached suggests a connection to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. Finally, the optimization of the ellipsoidal bounds in terms of volume suggests a connection to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
