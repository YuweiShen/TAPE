Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The paper also mentions efficient pattern searches, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category. The use of compression techniques and space complexity analysis could also make it relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new data structure, which could make it relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. Finally, the use of self-indexing techniques could make it relevant to the Structured Data and Indexing (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
