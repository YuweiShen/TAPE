Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also deals with predicting video relevance, which is a task related to information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a likely category as well. The use of different architectures and ensemble strategies suggests the involvement of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also mentions the use of frame and video level features, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), respectively, making them less likely categories but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
