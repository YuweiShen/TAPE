The paper also discusses the properties of the estimators and their applications, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The use of Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) as a universal code also suggests a connection to statistical inference (cs.SI) and information theory and probability (cs.ITP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
