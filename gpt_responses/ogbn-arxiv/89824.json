Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the deployment of MEC servers on generic computing platforms, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses collaborative caching and processing, which falls under the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses interference cancellation, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses technical challenges and open-research issues, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
