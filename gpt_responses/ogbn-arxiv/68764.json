Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the construction of codes using automorphisms on polynomial rings, which falls under the category of algebraic coding theory. This could be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions the use of linear operators to construct codes, which could be classified under cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
