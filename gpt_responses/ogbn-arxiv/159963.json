The paper also discusses adversarial training, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper focuses on physical attacks, which fall under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new abstract adversarial model, which involves crafting adversarial examples, a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with image classification, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
