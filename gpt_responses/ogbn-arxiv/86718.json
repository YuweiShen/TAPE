The algorithm also involves the use of Voronoi-Delaunay meshes, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper includes comparisons with state-of-the-art meshing methods, which could be considered a form of performance evaluation or benchmarking in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
