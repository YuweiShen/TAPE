The problem of Convex Set Disjointness is a geometric problem, which is related to Set Disjointness and Greater-Than problems, both of which are studied in the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also uses communication complexity theory, which is studied in the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, and the protocols developed in the paper are based on geometric statements, which may be of independent interest and are related to Computational Geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of Distributed Linear Program (LP) Feasibility, which is related to Optimization (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
