The paper also proposes a neural network architecture for learning attention maps, which is a common technique used in computer vision. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a novel neural network architecture for learning attention maps. \n\nThe paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a method for encoding local features into a discriminative global descriptor, which is a common problem in AI. \n\nThe paper may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as place recognition is an important problem in robotics, especially for autonomous navigation. \n\nFinally, the paper may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it uses the term \"contextual attention\" in the title, which is a common term in NLP. However, this is less likely as the paper does not deal with natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
