The method proposed in the paper involves the use of machine learning techniques, such as SVMs, which are also commonly studied in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep features, which are a popular topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of edge statistics, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of spatial bins, which are a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
