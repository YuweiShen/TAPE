Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses pre-processing choices and solutions for robustness to noise and domain adaptation, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions ensemble models, which involve combining multiple models, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of parallel data and the potential impact of orthographic variations, which could be related to computer vision and image processing, making cs.CV a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
