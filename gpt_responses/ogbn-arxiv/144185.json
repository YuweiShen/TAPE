The paper proposes a noise model and auxiliary information set to improve voting outcomes, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), social and information networks (cs.SI), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
