The concept of 2-planarity is closely related to graph theory and combinatorics (cs.DM), and the paper uses techniques from both fields. The paper also discusses the properties of topological drawings, which are relevant to the study of data structures (cs.DS). The paper includes proofs and mathematical arguments, which are typical of papers in theoretical computer science (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of its results, such as the possibility of efficient algorithms for drawing quasiplanar graphs, which is relevant to computer graphics and visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
