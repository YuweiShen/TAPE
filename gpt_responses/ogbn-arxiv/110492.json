The proposed method uses a deep learning approach to predict dense text boundary points, which is a common technique in computer vision and falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of multi-scale features, which is a common technique in machine learning and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of public datasets, which is a common technique in information retrieval and falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the use of text segmentation, which is a common technique in natural language processing and falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the use of image processing techniques, which is a common technique in multimedia processing and falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
