The proposed model is a neural network (cs.LG) that learns separate representations for adjectives and nouns, and optimizes the classification performance over their product. The paper also discusses the use of noisy labels and the ability of the model to generalize to new images, which are topics in machine learning (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
