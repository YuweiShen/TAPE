The paper proposes two neural mention detection approaches and evaluates them with coreference resolution as a downstream task, using multitask learning. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes two methods to deal with partially annotated data, which involves machine learning techniques such as weighted loss and soft-target classification. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
