It proposes a new algorithm called Path Consistency Learning (PCL) that minimizes a notion of soft consistency error along multi-step action sequences extracted from both on- and off-policy traces. This work is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new RL algorithm. It also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with RL, robotics (cs.RO) as it can be applied to robot control, systems and control (cs.SY) as it involves control theory, and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) as it proposes a new algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
