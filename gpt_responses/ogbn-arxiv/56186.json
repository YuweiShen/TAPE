This approach is aimed at addressing the instability of GAN training in high-dimensional spaces, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the use of gradients in the training process, which is a key concept in neural networks (cs.NE) and optimization (cs.GR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.GR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
