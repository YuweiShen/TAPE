The proposed receiver is designed to reduce the complexity of message passing algorithm (MPA), which is commonly used in SCMA systems. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of communication and networking (cs.COMM), network infrastructure (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), and machine learning (cs.LG) as these areas are closely related to the design and optimization of communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
