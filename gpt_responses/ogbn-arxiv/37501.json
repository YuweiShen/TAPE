This is a common problem in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a new regularization technique, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to capture correlations among convolution filters is a statistical approach, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Overall, the paper is likely to belong to one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
