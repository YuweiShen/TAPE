The proposed solution also involves cryptographic techniques such as blurring keys management, which further supports this category.\n2. cs.IOT (Internet of Things): The paper mentions the application of blockchain technology in IoT, and the proposed solution is designed for smart surveillance at the edge, which is an IoT use case.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses video surveillance systems and real-time video analytics, which are related to computer vision and pattern recognition.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed solution involves transforming the VSS into a federated blockchain network, which is a distributed computing approach.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new system for privacy protection in surveillance systems, which involves software design and implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
