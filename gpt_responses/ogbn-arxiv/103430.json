The use of Google Scholar, Mendeley, CiteULike, and Wiki suggests a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The analysis of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google-plus indicates a focus on social computing (cs.SOC). The use of altmetrics as a field of study suggests a focus on cybernetics (cs.CYBER). Finally, the proposal of a new index for measuring social impact suggests a focus on social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
