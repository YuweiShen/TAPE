The paper also discusses preprocessing-based approaches and real-time planning, which are topics commonly studied in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions uncertain object orientation, which is a problem often encountered in computer vision (cs.CV). The use of robots in automation also involves control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques, which could also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
