The paper also mentions the use of automatic selection methods for algorithm parameters, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The use of parallelism and acceleration schemes suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of multiple regularizers, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
