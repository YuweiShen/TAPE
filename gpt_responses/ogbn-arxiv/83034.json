This topic falls under the category of computer networks (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes new heuristics for selecting rates, which involves optimization and decision-making, making it relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the behavior and performance of the heuristics, which could be considered a form of simulation and modeling, making it relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
