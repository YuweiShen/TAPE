The system integrates particle filters for tracking and localizing, a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for dynamic path planning, and a search termination criteria to maximize the number of located animals within power constraints of the aerial system. These techniques are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), control systems (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.MA) research. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
