The paper proposes a context tree based approach for lossless and lossy compression of detected contours in images. This involves designing algorithms for optimal trade-off between coding rate and distortion of the approximate contour. The paper also uses a geometric prior to estimate symbols' conditional probabilities. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
