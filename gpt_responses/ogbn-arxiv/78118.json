The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models and fine-tuning for transfer learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method of automatically tuning fully connected layers using Bayesian optimization involves optimization techniques, which is a sub-topic of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which is a sub-topic of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which involves evaluation and comparison of results, falling under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
