The paper also proposes a new streaming SVM algorithm based on the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem, which is a well-known optimization problem in machine learning. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it deals with the problem of designing efficient algorithms for processing large datasets in a streaming (online) setting, which requires sub-linear space. The paper proposes a new algorithm based on the blurred ball cover, which is a data structure used for efficient nearest neighbor search. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as SVMs are widely used in computer vision for tasks such as object recognition, image classification, and face detection. The paper may also propose a new streaming SVM algorithm that is specifically designed for processing large-scale image datasets. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as SVMs are a popular tool in the field of AI for tasks such as classification, regression, and anomaly detection. The paper may also propose a new streaming SVM algorithm that is specifically designed for processing large-scale datasets in real-time, which is a key requirement in many"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
