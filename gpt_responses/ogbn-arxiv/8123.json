This is a common technique in the field of machine learning and falls under the category of \"dimensionality reduction\" (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of compressed sensing techniques (cs.IT) and numerical optimization methods (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper involves the manipulation of large datasets (cs.DS) and the evaluation of numerical simulations (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
