This involves designing a pre-beamforming scheme that requires only coarse information about the users angles of arrival and angular spread. Information theory is closely related to the design and analysis of communication systems, and this paper proposes a new approach to improve the efficiency of multiuser MIMO downlink communication. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new approach to multiuser MIMO downlink that can potentially improve the efficiency of communication systems. This is relevant to the networking and internet architecture community, as it can help improve the performance of wireless networks. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a new approach to multiuser MIMO downlink that can potentially improve the efficiency of communication systems. This is relevant to the social and information networks community, as it can help improve the performance of wireless networks, which are an important component of social and information networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a new approach to multiuser MIMO downlink that can potentially improve the efficiency of communication systems.
