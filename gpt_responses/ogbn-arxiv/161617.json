This suggests a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the problem of estimating continuous-time stochastic processes, which is a topic of interest in signal processing and control theory, suggesting a possible fit with cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
