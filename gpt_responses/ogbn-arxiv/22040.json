The proposed implementation is efficient and optimized for hardware, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the architecture and logic synthesis of the decoder, which falls under computer architecture (cs.AR) and digital systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the throughput and complexity of the decoder, which falls under control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
