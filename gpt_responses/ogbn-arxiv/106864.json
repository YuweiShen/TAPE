The paper also presents a new perspective on kernelized locality-sensitive hashing (KLSH), which is a machine learning algorithm, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on benchmark image retrieval datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
