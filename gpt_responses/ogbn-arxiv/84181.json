The use of geometric separators, which are a tool from graph theory, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures (cs.DS). The development of approximation schemes involves the use of mathematical programming techniques, which may place the paper in the sub-category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of quasi-polynomial time algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the study of approximation guarantees may place the paper in the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
