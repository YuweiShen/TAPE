This makes it likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a greedy algorithm for solving the problem, which falls under the category of Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper also presents an application of the method in source localization, which is related to the field of Systems and Control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
