This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel hashing loss function and a two-branch CNN-RNN architecture, which are deep learning techniques and hence, the paper could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper demonstrates the superior performance of their approach in zero-shot settings and sketch recognition, which involves generalization and transfer learning, respectively, and hence, the paper could also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
