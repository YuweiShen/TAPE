The use of a maneuver automaton and control policy suggests a focus on system control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of feedback strategies and modular design also suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
