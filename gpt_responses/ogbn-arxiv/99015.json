The paper also proposes a nonconvex optimization formulation for the problem, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of sparse and low-rank matrices, which are commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
