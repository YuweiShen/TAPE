The use of decision diagrams is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) for efficient representation and manipulation of large datasets. The paper also discusses algorithms and efficiency, which are topics commonly studied in computer science theory (cs.DS).
