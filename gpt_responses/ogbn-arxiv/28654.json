The paper also proposes a novel Kalman filter and hypothesize-and-select framework, which could be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. Finally, the paper discusses the potential security implications of tracking in traffic scenes, which could make it relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
