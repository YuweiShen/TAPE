The algorithm is designed for efficient computation, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also includes an extensive experimental study, which could fall under data structures (cs.DS) as it involves comparing the performance of different algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
