The focus on improving model robustness and uncertainty estimation suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of adversarial examples and label corruption also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the mention of out-of-distribution detection suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
