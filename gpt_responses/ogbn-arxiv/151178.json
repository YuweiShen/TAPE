The paper also discusses the limitations of derandomized parallel repetition, which is a promising avenue for achieving many tight inapproximability results. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves concepts from information theory (cs.IT), data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
