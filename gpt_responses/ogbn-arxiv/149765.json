The use of quadratic forms and the NP-hardness of the problem suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the optimization (cs.OH) and algorithms (cs.DS) communities. The proposed computational approaches involve iterative methods and error-bound techniques, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and statistical inference (cs.SI) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
