The focus on finding sub-populations that are exceptional with regard to the global distribution suggests a connection to data mining (cs.DM) and databases (cs.DB). The use of a control variable also suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR), where controlling for variables is important in many applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
