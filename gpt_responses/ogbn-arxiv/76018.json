The use of recurrent neural networks also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed direct loss function and optimization method may also place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of deep neural networks for medical image analysis may also suggest the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of CT and MRI scans may suggest the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
