The paper focuses on the verification of MPI programs with both blocking and non-blocking operations, which suggests a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The use of model checking also suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the use of symbolic execution and model checking together suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
