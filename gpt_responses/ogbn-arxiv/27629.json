The paper also discusses the use of neural language models and sequence-to-sequence models, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with the challenges of working with a morphologically rich language, which could fall under the category of natural language processing (cs.NE) or computational linguistics (cs.CL).
