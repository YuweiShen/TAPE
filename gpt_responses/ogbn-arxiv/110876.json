The paper also discusses optimization of a utility function, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of channel statistics and power control also suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents results for general concave utility functions, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
