It also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as DNNs are commonly used in this field. The paper's focus on memory usage and optimization suggests it could also fall under the sub-categories of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Finally, the use of compression techniques to improve performance suggests it could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
