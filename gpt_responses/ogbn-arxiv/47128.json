The proposed approach involves using Markov Chain random sampling and a multi-armed bandit problem formulation, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of visibility in planning, which is a common concept in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper's focus on balancing global exploration and local connectivity exploitation is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
