The approach proposed involves learning heuristics from human domain experts, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of human-machine collaboration, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
