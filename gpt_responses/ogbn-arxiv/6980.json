This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n2. cs.CL: The paper deals with text-based games and the expansion of the agent's vocabulary. This involves natural language processing techniques, which is a subfield of computational linguistics.\n3. cs.LG: The paper discusses the use of policy distillation method for video games in the text-based game setting. This involves training a model to mimic the behavior of a larger model, which is a technique used in machine learning.\n4. cs.CC: The paper involves the analysis of policy distillation approach in detail. This involves the use of computational techniques to analyze the approach.\n5. cs.SD: The paper involves the use of text-based games as a test-bed to analyze and understand policy distillation approach. This involves the use of simulation and modeling techniques, which is a subfield of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
