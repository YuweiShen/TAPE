The techniques used in the paper involve combinatorial structures such as extremal $t$-agreeing families of $[q]^n$, which are closely related to topics in discrete mathematics and graph theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper cites results from information theory (Ahlswede-Khachatrian [AK98]) and graph theory (Frankl [F76]), which suggest that cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.IT (Information Theory) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
