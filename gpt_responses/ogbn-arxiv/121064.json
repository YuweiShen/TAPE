The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of Sparseout on image classification (cs.CV) and language modelling (cs.CL), which are common applications of deep learning. Additionally, the paper proposes a new regularization technique, which could be considered a contribution to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
