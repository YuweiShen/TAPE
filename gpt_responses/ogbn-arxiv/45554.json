The use of breadth-first search and $s-t$ paths as informative features suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of social networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), and systems and control (cs.SY). The focus on graph mining and heuristics also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
