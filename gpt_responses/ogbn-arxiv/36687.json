Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. The paper also discusses statistical techniques and technical solutions for processing large data sets, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DL (Digital Libraries), and cs.LG (Machine Learning).
