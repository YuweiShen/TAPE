The paper also mentions two specific classes of binary codes derived from Boolean functions, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes open problems related to binary linear codes from Boolean functions, which could fall under data structures (cs.DS) or social and information networks (cs.SI) if the problems involve network coding or graph theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
