The paper also highlights recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) through approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs), which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses control systems, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.RO sub-category.
