Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of oracles and approximation algorithms, which are topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), respectively. The paper also mentions polyhedral distance functions, which are relevant to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
