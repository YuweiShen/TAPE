The paper proposes a neural module network architecture for visual dialog that performs explicit, grounded, coreference resolution at a finer word level. This work involves computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), which are both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI). The paper also involves machine learning (ML) techniques, which are often used in AI research. The paper falls under the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), in order of decreasing likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
