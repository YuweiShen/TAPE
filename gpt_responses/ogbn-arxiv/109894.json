Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of VLC for data transmission, which involves signal processing and information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. The paper also discusses the use of VLC for multimedia applications, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the security challenges of VLC, which falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper discusses the performance evaluation of the proposed systems, which involves simulation and experimentation, making cs.COM (Computers and Society) another likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
