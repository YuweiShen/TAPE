The paper also discusses the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The use of quantization techniques to improve the robustness of DNNs is a form of defense mechanism, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
