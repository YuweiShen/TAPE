The focus is on multi-graphs and different kinds of relationships between users, which is a key area of research in social network analysis. \n2. cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) - The paper deals with social networks and friend recommendation, which is a key area of research in social and economic networks. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a method to mine network representation that effectively exploits heterogeneity in multi-graphs. This involves the use of machine learning techniques for link prediction. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper evaluates the proposed model on a real-world, active social network where this system is deployed for friend recommendation for millions of users. This involves the use of information retrieval techniques to measure accuracy and user satisfaction. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a method to mine network representation that effectively exploits heterogeneity in multi-graphs. This involves the use of data structures and algorithms for network embedding and link prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
