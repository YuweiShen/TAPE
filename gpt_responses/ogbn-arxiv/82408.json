The proposed algorithm involves designing a guiding vector field (GVF) based on the robot's kinematic model and a predefined smooth function, which is a problem in control systems (cs.SY). The algorithm also involves a nonlinear motion controller, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper includes experimental results with wheeled robots, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for perception and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
