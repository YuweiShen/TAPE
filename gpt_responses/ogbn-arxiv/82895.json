This involves exchanging information messages between transmitters and the base station, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme is designed for cellular multi-carrier systems, which are a key component of modern wireless networks. The paper also discusses the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of distributed resource allocation, which is a key issue in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a resource allocation scheme that does not require the presence of a central controller, which is a key concept in systems and control. The proposed approach distributes the computational effort among all the transmitters in the cell, which is also a key issue in systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme is designed for multi-carrier systems, which are commonly used for multimedia applications such as video streaming and audio transmission. The paper also discusses the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of resource allocation for multimedia applications. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed scheme is a distributed resource allocation scheme that involves exchanging information messages between transmitters and the base station.
