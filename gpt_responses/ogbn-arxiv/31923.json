This topic is closely related to several sub-categories in computer science. cs.DB (Databases) is the most likely category as the paper deals with managing data from multiple sources. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DL (Digital Libraries) are also likely categories as they involve techniques for searching and integrating data. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible category as it deals with techniques for searching and retrieving information. Finally, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is a possible category as the paper discusses the shortcomings of existing frameworks and suggests new research directions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
