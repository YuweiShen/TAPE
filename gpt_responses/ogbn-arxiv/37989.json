This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of a multiple-input-single-output-multiple-eavesdropper simultaneous wireless information and power transferring (MISOME-SWIPT) system, which involves networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates a secrecy energy efficiency maximization problem in the MISOME-SWIPT system with proportional secrecy rate constraints, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless information and power transferring, which can be considered as a multimedia application. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on maximizing secrecy energy efficiency in a wireless communication system, which is related to cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
