The paper describes two approaches for generating the datasets and employs an iterative decoding strategy that is tailored to the loosely supervised nature of the constructed corpora. The paper also demonstrates that neural GEC models trained using either type of corpora give similar performance and surpass the state of the art on both the CoNLL-2014 benchmark and the JFLEG task. Given this focus on natural language processing and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The iterative decoding strategy and the use of ensembling also suggest that the paper could be relevant to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
