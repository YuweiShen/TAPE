The paper presents an algebraic condition on the polymorphism clone of the structure, which is a concept from universal algebra, and proves that it is sufficient for the hardness of the surjective CSP. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the areas of computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
