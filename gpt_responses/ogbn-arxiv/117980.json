The paper also proposes a new algorithm for learning basis functions that is efficient and provides a fast approximator, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of optimization algorithms, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sparse coding for achieving better accuracy, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE).
