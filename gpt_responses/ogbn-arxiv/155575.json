The paper also introduces a new feature extractor that improves semantic inference, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of adaptive aggregation weights is also related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of the proposed method for large-scale recognition tasks, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
