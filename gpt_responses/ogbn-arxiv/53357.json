The method is based on lock-in feedback, which is a common technique in control systems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes algorithms for use in sequential experiments, which can be seen as a form of optimization. The problem of finding maxima of unknown functions is also a common problem in optimization. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a method for finding maxima of unknown functions through experimentation, which can be seen as a form of learning. The method is based on feedback, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a method for finding maxima of unknown functions through sequential experimentation, which can be seen as a form of optimization. The method is based on feedback, which is a common technique in neural and evolutionary computing. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes algorithms for use in sequential experiments, which can be seen as a form of software development. The algorithms are designed to address a specific problem and can be implemented in software."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
