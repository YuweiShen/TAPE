The use of cryptographic hash values and URIs is related to digital libraries (cs.DL) and security and cryptography (cs.CR). The focus on linked data and RDF graphs suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the emphasis on compatibility with existing standards and protocols and practicality points to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
