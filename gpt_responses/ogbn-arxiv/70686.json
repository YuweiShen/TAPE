The paper also discusses the space complexity of the protocol, which falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The use of phase clocks for synchronisation and coordination is a common technique in Distributed Computing, which could place the paper under the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a new protocol, which involves pairwise interactions between agents, making it relevant to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses formal argumentation to prove the correctness and efficiency of the proposed protocol, which could place it under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
