This falls under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI), as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB) since the proposed model uses frequent itemset mining algorithms to detect collusion groups. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential impact of collusion attacks on online rating systems, which could fall under the sub-categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
