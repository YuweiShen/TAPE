Additionally, the paper deals with the representation of semantic properties and entities, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The experiments conducted in the paper involve evaluating the hidden state vectors of neural readers, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Learning) sub-category.
