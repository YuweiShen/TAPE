The paper proposes machine learning-based QoT frameworks and compares centralized and distributed frameworks. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). However, since the paper also deals with machine learning, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, since the paper also deals with information theory, it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
