The experiments also include motion planning for a Dubins car, which is a common problem in robotics. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimal control of nonlinear systems, which is a core topic in systems and control. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper introduces importance sampling, which is a common technique in machine learning. The method also involves approximating the optimal control as a weighted sum of given bases, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for computing an optimal policy function, which is a common topic in AI. The method also involves direct policy search, which is a common approach in AI. \n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering): Although not the main focus of the paper, the experiments involve implementing the proposed method, which involves software engineering skills."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
