The use of bag of words (BoWs) models and histograms of optical flow also suggests a focus on computer vision. The paper also proposes a method for embedding SPD manifolds to Euclidean spaces, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of covariance matrices and Riemannian geometry could also suggest a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
