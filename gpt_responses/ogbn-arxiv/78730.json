The proposed method uses deep learning techniques, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are a popular tool in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the challenge of training an end-to-end model for irregularity detection, which is a problem that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is applied to videos, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of self-supervised learning, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
