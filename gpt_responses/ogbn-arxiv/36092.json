The paper also mentions the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is a topic in Cryptography (cs.CR). The algorithmic description and analysis of the method of DaYan deriving one may fall under the categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents a comparison of Qin's algorithm with the Extended Euclidean algorithm, which is a topic in Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
