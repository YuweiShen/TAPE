The focus is on the performance of different shaping techniques for the nonlinear fiber optical channel, which involves signal processing and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of finite blocklengths, which is a topic in information theory and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents results on bit-error rate and bit-metric decoding rate, which are metrics used in performance evaluation of communication systems and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
