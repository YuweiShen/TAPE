The paper also introduces a new formulation for unmixing, which involves optimization and statistical modeling, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of a spatial and sparsity promoting prior, which is relevant to signal processing and image analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on synthetic and real images, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
