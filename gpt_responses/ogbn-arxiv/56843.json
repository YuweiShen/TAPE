The paper proposes a capsule network based model for rating prediction with user reviews. The model extracts informative logic units from the reviews and infers their corresponding sentiments to enable better rating prediction with explanation. This work involves natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems, which are all relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the work involves extracting information from user reviews to improve recommendation. Other likely sub-categories include cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), as the work involves deep learning, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
