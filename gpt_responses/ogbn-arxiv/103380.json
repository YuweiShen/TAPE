It is a domain-general data analysis method that infers multiple non-overlapping views of the data and uses a separate nonparametric mixture to model each view. The method is based on approximately Bayesian inference in a hierarchical, nonparametric model for data tables. The paper includes empirical results on heterogeneous tabular data of up to 10 million cells, such as hospital cost and quality measures, voting records, unemployment rates, gene expression measurements, and images of handwritten digits. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DB (Databases), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
