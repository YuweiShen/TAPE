The proposed method involves replacing the output activation function of DNNs with a graph Laplacian-based high dimensional interpolating function, which integrates the advantages of both deep learning and manifold learning. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
