It uses Web of Science data to investigate whether papers with similar attributes but assigned to different fields receive different citations. This analysis is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), computational complexity (cs.CY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, given the focus on bibliometrics and citation analysis, cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
