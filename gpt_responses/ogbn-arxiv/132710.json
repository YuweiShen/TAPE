The use of distributions and mutual information suggests a connection to probability and statistics, which could place the paper in sub-categories such as cs.DS (data structures) or cs.DM (discrete mathematics). Finally, the study of communication protocols and their efficiency could also be relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which could place the paper in cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
