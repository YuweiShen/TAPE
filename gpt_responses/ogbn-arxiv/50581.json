This involves evolving constraints and candidate solutions together through an inverse fitness interaction process. This approach falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves developing algorithms for solving constrained problems. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of tree-search algorithms like backtracking, which falls under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of heuristics for selecting good variable ordering also falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of GA for learning weights falls under the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses experiments conducted on several instances, which falls under the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
