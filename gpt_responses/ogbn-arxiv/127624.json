The use of deep learning networks and statistical analysis also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also deals with image compression and manipulation, which could place it in the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of probability maps and classification results to locate tampered areas suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
