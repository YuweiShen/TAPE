Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the speed of evaluation, which could fall under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). Finally, the paper involves proving the minimality of a representation, which could be related to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
