The problem also has applications in networking systems, which falls under the category of network and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of linear programming techniques and polyhedral characterizations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to optimization and control theory (cs.RO) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
