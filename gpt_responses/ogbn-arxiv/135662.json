The paper specifically focuses on methods that leverage a very small episodic memory for CL, which suggests that it may fall under the category of \"Memory-Based Learning\" (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of supervised learning tasks and methods, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of \"Supervised Learning\" (cs.LG, cs.AI) and \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning and prior experience, which suggests that it may fall under the category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on the CL setting, which suggests that it may fall under the category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
