This involves the use of a vector map of the path and calculating the shortest path by Grid Count Method (GCM) of Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm. The paper also discusses the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags for landmark determination and verification of source and destination, and an Object Detection Module (ODM) built by Faster R-CNN with VGGNet-16 architecture for supporting path planning by detecting and recognizing obstacles. These topics are all related to robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
