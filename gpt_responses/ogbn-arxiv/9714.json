The use of Bi-Directional LSTMs also suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are a type of database (cs.DB), and the tasks of link prediction and triple classification, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
