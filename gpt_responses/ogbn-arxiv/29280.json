The use of permutation codes and the Kendall's $\\tau$-metric suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the concept of perfect codes, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR), and the size of codes with large automorphism groups, which is relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
