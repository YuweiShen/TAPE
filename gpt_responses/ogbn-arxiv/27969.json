The proposed solution involves using compressed sensing on the least squares residual computed using the previous estimate of the support, which is a novel approach. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper includes a dynamic MRI example, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Systems and Control (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
