The paper also discusses the need for real-time performance and safety, which are important considerations in control systems (cs.SY). The proposed method uses reachability analysis, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also compares the proposed method with other trajectory planning methods, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.LG, cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
