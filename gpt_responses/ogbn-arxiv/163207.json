The use of orthogonal channels and the presence of a passive eavesdropper suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of Gaussian channel models and multiantenna systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
