Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with multimodal data (video and audio transcripts), which suggests that it could be classified under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper mentions using computer vision techniques to extract visual features from the videos, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses evaluating the summarization using metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) research, indicating a possible classification under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper proposes a new evaluation metric that measures semantic adequacy, which could be relevant to researchers in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
