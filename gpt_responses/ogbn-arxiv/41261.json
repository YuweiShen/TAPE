The paper introduces a new concept called time-local predicting information (TiPI) and derives explicit update rules for the parameters of the controller in the dynamical systems framework. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), systems and control (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
