The approach is based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and aims to improve the node classification performance on few-shot learning problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
