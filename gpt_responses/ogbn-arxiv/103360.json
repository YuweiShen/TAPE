Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper uses Correspondence Analysis and hierarchical clustering, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the need for support tools for television movie writing, which could fall under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper's methodology involves quantitative and algorithmic frameworks, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
