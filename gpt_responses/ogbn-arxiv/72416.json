The use of limited labeled data and data augmentation is also a common issue in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of neural networks for classification, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with SAR imaging, which is a topic in graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
