This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a new countermeasure to mitigate DoS attacks in LTI systems, which is a security-related problem. Therefore, cs.CR is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses a message rerouting strategy to prevent DoS attacks, which involves transmitting states through different communication links. This involves information theory concepts and hence, cs.IT is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with communication links and their prioritization in LTI systems, which is a networking-related problem. Therefore, cs.NI is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a structured $\\mathcal{H}_2$ control algorithm to determine the post-attack optimal feedback gains. This involves optimization techniques and hence, cs.AI is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
