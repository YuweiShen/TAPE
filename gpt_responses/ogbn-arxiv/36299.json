Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of network churn on the effectiveness of the compact block protocol, which is a security and privacy concern, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely category. The proposed solution involves maintaining mempool synchronization among Bitcoin nodes, which is a distributed systems problem, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible category. The paper also presents experimental evidence and proposes a new prioritized data synchronization protocol, which involves data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another possible category. Finally, the proposed solution aims to improve the resilience of the Bitcoin network, which is a system-level problem, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
