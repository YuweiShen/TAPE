The use of randomized algorithms and analysis of success probability suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Lastly, the focus on space complexity and lower bounds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
