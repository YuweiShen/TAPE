The use of self-play and iterative learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The specific problem of negotiating and interacting with other agents falls under the subfield of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The simulation of merging traffic involves robotics and control (cs.RO), and the need for agents to anticipate and react to other agents' actions suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
