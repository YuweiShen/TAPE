The use of V-BLAST and 4-QAM suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and computer engineering (cs.CE) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of Rayleigh fading and the use of multiple antennas suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
