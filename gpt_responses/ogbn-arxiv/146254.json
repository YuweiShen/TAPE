Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Liquid Haskell for checking equational proofs, which falls under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also involves formal logic and proof theory, which could place it in the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper deals with functional programming, which could place it in the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of theorem proving, which could place it in the Computational Logic (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
