The paper also mentions the practical applications of the proposed technique in software development and education, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of automated techniques for synthesizing proofs and invariants also suggests a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed technique on pairs of solutions submitted by students, which suggests a connection to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) in terms of verifying the correctness of student submissions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
