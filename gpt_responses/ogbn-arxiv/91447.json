This involves quantifying his local and global reading decisions using an information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. The paper also examines the trade-off between exploitation and exploration in information foraging. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are computational linguistics (cs.CL), digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
