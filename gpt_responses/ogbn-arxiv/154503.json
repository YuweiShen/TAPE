This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Game Theory sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a Markov decision process (MDP) and provides an optimal coordinated learning algorithm for a multi-agent variant of the multi-armed bandit problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with learning in a multi-agent system and provides an efficient factored algorithm for distributed computation of the optimal policy among the agents. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a multi-agent system and provides an incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achieves the optimal joint plan. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Multi-Agent Systems sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper provides an efficient factored algorithm for distributed computation of the optimal policy among the agents.
