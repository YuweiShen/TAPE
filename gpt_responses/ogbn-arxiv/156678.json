It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as deep neural networks are a popular tool in these fields. Additionally, the paper may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it discusses techniques for reducing the quantization loss in neural networks. Finally, the paper may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as deep neural networks are often used in multimedia applications such as image and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
