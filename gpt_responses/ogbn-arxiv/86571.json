The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework aims to improve the efficiency of face detection, which is a common goal in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing face detection methods, which could be relevant to the field of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
