This involves applying unit propagation and selecting relevant clauses based on metrics like the literal block distance (LBD). The paper also includes an empirical investigation with instances from hard combinatorial and application categories of recent SAT competitions. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper deals with improving the performance of SAT solvers, which is a fundamental problem in AI and algorithm design. The other likely sub-categories are cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.SE (Software Engineering) as the paper involves the development and evaluation of a new approach for SAT solvers, which is relevant to these sub-fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
