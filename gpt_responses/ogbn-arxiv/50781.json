The paper also discusses the index coding problem, which is related to network coding and communication complexity (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes schemes that exploit the null space and side information of the receivers, which are techniques commonly used in signal processing and coding theory (cs.SI). The paper also deals with MIMO systems, which are a topic in wireless communication and signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the capacity region of the index coding problem, which is a topic in coding theory and communication complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
