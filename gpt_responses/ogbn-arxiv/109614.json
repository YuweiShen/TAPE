The paper also discusses the list-decoding capacity of LDPC codes, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The paper uses graph-based codes, which are related to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses local properties of codes, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for linear-time list-decodable codes, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
