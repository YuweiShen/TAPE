The use of symmetric menu complexity as a measure of the complexity of the mechanism suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the study of combinatorial optimization (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.IT). Finally, the use of subadditive valuations and the focus on approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the study of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
