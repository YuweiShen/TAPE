The paper also introduces a declarative extension of SQL for video analytics, which relates to database systems (cs.DB). The optimization techniques presented in the paper involve using NNs as control variates and a novel search algorithm, which are both related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
