These characteristics suggest that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization of design parameters and control policies, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also mentions examples of CCMA systems and their simulation results, which could be relevant to the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category. The use of optimization methods for tasks such as internal collision avoidance and external obstacle avoidance could be related to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the validation of the trajectory optimization method through experiments could be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
