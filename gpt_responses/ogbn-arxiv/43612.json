This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The proposed technique is applied to natural image coding and piecewise smooth image coding, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper introduces a novel graph estimation algorithm, which could also make it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with signal compression, which could make it relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
