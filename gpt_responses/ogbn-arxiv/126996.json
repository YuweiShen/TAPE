Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and optimization, which could also place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of feedback and oracle access suggests a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and the mention of noisy gradient signs suggests a possible connection to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
