The paper also considers hardware impairments and low-complexity receivers, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a common technique in wireless communication, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel explicit characterization that gives Pareto optimal transmit strategies, which is related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
