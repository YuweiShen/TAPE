This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) as the system uses image recognition algorithms to detect and identify animals. Additionally, the use of machine learning and data management also falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), deep learning (cs.DL), and cybernetics (cs.CY). The paper also discusses the challenges of managing and analyzing large datasets, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
