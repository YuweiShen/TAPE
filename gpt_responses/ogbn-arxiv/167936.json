The focus on causality-based feature selection suggests a strong connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of algorithms to select features also suggests a connection to data science (cs.DS) and computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the development of an open-source package and the experimental evaluation of algorithms suggest a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
