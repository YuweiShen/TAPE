This involves game theory (cs.GT) as the mechanism must be strategy-proof, and data structures (cs.DS) as the reviews must be stored and processed efficiently. The classification problem itself is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the use of reviews implies some information theory (cs.IT) may be involved."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
