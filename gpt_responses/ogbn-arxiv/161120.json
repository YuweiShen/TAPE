The paper also discusses different notions of program equivalence, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The complexity bounds and implementation method mentioned in the abstract suggest that the paper may also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
