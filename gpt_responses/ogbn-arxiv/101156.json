The paper also proposes a new variant of local SGD and studies its communication efficiency and performance trade-offs, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the issue of generalization performance in large-batch training, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
