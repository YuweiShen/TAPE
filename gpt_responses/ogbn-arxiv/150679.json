The use of spanners and skeletons is also relevant to network engineering (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of polynomial-time algorithms, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of algorithms with low computational complexity, which is related to algorithm design and analysis (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
