This involves a learned primal-dual reconstruction scheme using the Wasserstein distance as the loss function. This work is highly relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV), as well as information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) due to the use of optimal transport theory. Additionally, the paper involves training a reconstruction algorithm, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
