This problem is closely related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) as it involves the study of geometric objects and their properties. The paper also introduces an algorithm to solve this problem, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The problem of constructing polygons with angular constraints has applications in fields such as robotics, path planning, and image processing, which are covered by sub-categories such as cs.GR and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
