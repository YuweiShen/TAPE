The connection between the generalized Marcum-Q function and the hypergeometric function is also relevant to information theory. \n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper presents new expressions for the cumulative distributions of the bivariate Nakagami-m distribution and the distribution of the minimum eigenvalue of correlated non-central Wishart matrices. This involves numerical computations and analysis. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly discuss social networks, but the connection between the generalized Marcum-Q function and the hypergeometric function may have applications in network analysis. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not discuss machine learning, but the hypergeometric function is commonly used in statistical analysis and may have applications in machine learning. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper does not directly discuss systems and control, but the bivariate Nakagami-m distribution is commonly used in wireless communication systems, which may involve control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
