The focus on program semantics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to program analysis, which may be of interest to the subfield of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions approximations, which are commonly used in formal methods (cs.FL) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
