This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the effects of atmospheric turbulence and path loss, which are common in wireless communication systems, and hence, it could be categorized under computer communications (cs.COMM). The use of FSO links also involves the study of photonics (cs.PHOTONICS) and optics (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
