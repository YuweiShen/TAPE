It involves the analysis of words and their relationship between units of sense and units of form. This falls under the scope of computational linguistics, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of NooJ, which is a linguistic development environment that uses machine learning techniques to analyze and process natural language. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the scope of machine learning.\n\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of electronic dictionaries and transducers for the automatic processing of the Albanian language involves the use of AI techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning.\n\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the use of morphological tools of NooJ to create grammatical tools to represent and treat phenomena related to the diversity of word structures in Albanian. This may involve the use of neural and evolutionary computing techniques.\n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may involve the development of algorithms and data structures for the processing of Albanian language data using NooJ."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
