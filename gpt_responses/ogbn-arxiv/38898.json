This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) domain. The use of deep learning models for this task also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of optical flow maps, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research. The proposed fusion mechanisms for integrating spatial and temporal information also suggest that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning models for dynamic saliency prediction also suggests that the paper may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
