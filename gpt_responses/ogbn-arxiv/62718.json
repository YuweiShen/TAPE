This involves developing a regularization functional to avoid overfitting and reduce model complexity. The paper also presents an efficient backfitting algorithm with linear per-iteration complexity. Given these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.ST (Statistics)\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
