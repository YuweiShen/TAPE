The focus of the paper is on reducing communication overhead, which is a key issue in distributed optimization, and this is achieved through sparsification and compression techniques. These techniques involve manipulating the data that is communicated between devices, which is a topic that falls under the subfield of data compression (cs.DC). The paper also involves analyzing the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm, which is a topic that falls under the subfield of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper involves numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical findings, which is a topic that falls under the subfield of data science (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
