Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) and display port, which are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM). The use of fast session transfer (FST) protocol and time-division multiple access (TDMA) also suggests the involvement of information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the physical layer and medium access control layer of the protocol stack, which falls under the category of architecture and implementation (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
