The use of row-orthogonal matrices, such as the partial discrete Fourier transform matrix, is also a common technique in signal processing and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed algorithm is based on a state evolution analysis, which is a common approach in statistical physics and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, numerical experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm, which falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
