The paper proposes a novel algorithm for learning in these games, which is a significant contribution to the field of game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new algorithm for learning in resource allocation games, which is a problem in artificial intelligence. The algorithm uses semi-bandit feedback with side-observations, which is a common technique in AI. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new algorithm for learning in resource allocation games, which is a problem in machine learning. The algorithm uses semi-bandit feedback with side-observations, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for learning in resource allocation games, which is a problem in data structures and algorithms. The algorithm is based on path planning problems with side-observations, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a new algorithm for learning in resource allocation games, which is a problem in robotics.
