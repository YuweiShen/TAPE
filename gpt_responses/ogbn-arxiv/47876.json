Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the nearest neighbor classifier, which is commonly used in natural language processing, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) a possible sub-category.
