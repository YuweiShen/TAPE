Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves graph theory and combinatorics, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as likely sub-categories. The use of Galois theory and polynomials points towards cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with planar graphs and their properties, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
