It also involves networking (NI) concepts such as routing and network capacity. The optimization problem is non-convex and requires the use of optimization techniques such as Lagrangian dual decomposition and cutting-plane method, which fall under the category of systems and control (SY). The paper also mentions the use of matrix differential calculus, which falls under the category of multimedia (MM) and machine learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
