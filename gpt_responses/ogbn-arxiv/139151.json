This involves a combination of networking, distributed systems, and information theory concepts, which are covered by the arXiv categories cs.NI, cs.DC, and cs.IT. The platform also aims to deliver end-to-end services, which involves system-level considerations and may fall under the cs.SY category. Finally, the platform is being developed by a telecommunications research center, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.CE category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
