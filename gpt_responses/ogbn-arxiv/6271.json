The use of graphs and convolutional neural networks also suggests it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The consideration of intrinsic characteristics and attention mechanisms suggests it could also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
