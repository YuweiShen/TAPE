The proposed method involves generating steganographic adversarial examples, which can be considered a form of image manipulation and thus related to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of neural networks in steganalysis also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves experimentation and testing, which can be related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed method involves enhancing steganographic security, which can be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
