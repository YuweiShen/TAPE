This involves designing joint multicast and unicast beamforming strategies to maximize the weighted sum of the multicast rate and the unicast rate under per-BS power and backhaul constraints. Information theory concepts such as rate maximization and beamforming are central to the paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of providing multicast and unicast services concurrently in cellular networks with limited backhaul capacity. This involves designing joint base station clustering and beamforming strategies to optimize the use of network resources. Networking and internet architecture concepts such as backhaul constraints and base station clustering are central to the paper. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint multicast and unicast beamforming problem with adaptive base station clustering that aims to maximize the weighted sum of the multicast rate and the unicast rate under per-BS power and backhaul constraints. This involves designing control strategies to optimize the use of network resources. Systems and control concepts such as optimization and adaptive clustering are central to the paper. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of providing multicast and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
