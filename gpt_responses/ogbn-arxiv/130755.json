Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the impact of shadow fading on the resource request pmf, which falls under the category of network infrastructure (cs.NI). The use of millimeter wave frequencies is a key aspect of the paper, which suggests the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also deals with system parameters and their impact on the resource request pmf, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the approximation of the pmf, which is a statistical problem and falls under the category of cs.COM (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
