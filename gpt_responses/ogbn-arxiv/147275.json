The paper uses finite field theory and basic theory of cyclic codes and skew cyclic codes, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT) and computer algebra (cs.SC). The paper also discusses the dual codes and self-orthogonal codes, which are related to cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides an explicit expression for each outer code in any concatenated code, which involves computations and algorithms (cs.DS, cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
