The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques such as image-based grasp proposal and 3D reconstruction, which suggests that it could also be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of machine learning models for grasp proposal and 3D reconstruction also suggests that it could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves grasping objects in 3D space, which could also fall under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
