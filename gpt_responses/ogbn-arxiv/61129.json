The use of transposition networks is a novel approach to this problem, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses applications in bioinformatics, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-categories.
