The focus on preserving distances for a set of terminals suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The use of doubling metrics, which have been extensively studied in the context of metric embeddings (cs.MS), further supports this. Finally, the mention of labeling schemes and embeddings into normed spaces suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
