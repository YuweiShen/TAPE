This problem is closely related to topics such as data streaming, sketching, and compressed sensing, which are all subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT), databases (cs.DB), computational complexity (cs.CC), and data mining (cs.DM), which are all relevant to the problem of norm estimation in data streams."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
