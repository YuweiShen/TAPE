It proposes a new exploration method based on assigning exploration bonuses from a concurrently learned model of the system dynamics, which is parameterized with a neural network. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the development of algorithms and models for machine learning, which is the main focus of this paper.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the development of intelligent agents and their applications, which is relevant to this paper as it deals with reinforcement learning in complex domains.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the development of algorithms and systems for robotics, which is relevant to this paper as it deals with learning in complex environments.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the development of algorithms and models for computer vision, which is relevant to this paper as it deals with processing raw pixel inputs.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the development of control systems and their applications, which is relevant to this paper as it deals with learning to control agents in complex environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
