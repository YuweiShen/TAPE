The paper also discusses the capacity of small cell networks and the scheduling of multiple vehicles at a given infrastructure tower. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the channel characteristics unique to both THz and mmWave spectrum bands and analytically derives the resulting capacity of such a small cell network. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions potential use cases such as ultra-high-definition infotainment services, which fall under the category of multimedia. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the SDN-controlled admission policy, error recovery, and handling of distinct link states that arise due to motion along practical vehicular paths, which are all related to systems and control. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography and security, but the use of SDN in vehicular networks raises security concerns that could be addressed in future work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
