The paper proposes a policy gradient method for optimizing a combination of SPICE and CIDEr metrics, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Monte Carlo rollouts, which is a technique used in information retrieval (cs.IR).
