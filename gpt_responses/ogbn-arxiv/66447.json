This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the support for high data rates, which could relate to Multimedia (cs.MM) or Architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories.
