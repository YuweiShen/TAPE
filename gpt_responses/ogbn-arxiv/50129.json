The paper also discusses concerns about third-party use of private location information, which is a common topic in the cryptography and security sub-category.\n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses social networking services and their incorporation of location as a feature of user interaction. The paper also describes how an individual's social network structure can be revealed through location sharing preferences towards contacts. These topics are relevant to the social and information networks sub-category.\n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper describes the architecture and implementation of a location sharing system, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses protocol unification and masking, which are techniques used in data privacy and security.\n\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses location-based services and their integration with the Albatross system. This involves the use of databases to store and retrieve location information. The paper also describes how Albatross can enhance privacy in location-based services.\n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses concerns about privacy and security in location-based services, which are relevant to the computers and society sub-category. The paper also describes how Albatross can protect an individual's social network structure, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
