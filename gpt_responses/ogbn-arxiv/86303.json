This involves the use of unmanned flying platforms (NFPs) for transporting the traffic between access and core networks. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper primarily focuses on the design of a backhaul/fronthaul framework for wireless networks, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper investigates the feasibility of using FSO links for high-speed data transmission, which is a topic of interest in information theory. \n\n3. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the use of unmanned flying platforms (NFPs) for transporting the traffic, which is related to the field of robotics. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of FSO links for transporting multimedia traffic in 5G wireless networks. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper briefly mentions the security challenges associated with the proposed framework, which falls under the scope of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
