Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models and their limitations, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to fusion, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image datasets, which could also place it under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the use of adaptive weights, which could suggest it belongs to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
