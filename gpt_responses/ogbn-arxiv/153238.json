This involves algorithms for finding optimal sensor locations, balancing security gains with costs, and dealing with different types of evaders (deterministic or Markov chain-based and reactive or oblivious). These topics are closely related to the fields of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
