The paper also mentions the use of neuromorphic event cameras, which could potentially fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) or emerging technologies (cs.ET). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency and power consumption of the proposed architecture, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
