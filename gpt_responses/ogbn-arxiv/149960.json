This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of a video stream using scalable video coding (SVC), which is a multimedia technology. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers the transmission of a video stream from a multi-antenna base station to multiple groups of single-antenna users, which involves networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a beamforming scheme that leverages superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancelation (SIC), which are signal processing techniques. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision or pattern recognition, the use of scalable video coding (SVC) is a technique that is often used in computer vision applications such as video surveillance and object tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
