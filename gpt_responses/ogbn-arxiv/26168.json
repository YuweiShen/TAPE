The use of partial interference cancellation (PIC) group decoding and the trade-off between decoding complexity and code rate suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the grouping scheme for decoding, which is related to network information theory (cs.NI) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the simulation results and performance evaluation of the proposed STBCs suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
