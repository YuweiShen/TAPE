The paper proposes a new neural CTR model that combines the Deep Field-aware Factorization Machine (DeepFFM) with Compose-Excitation network (CENet) field attention mechanism. The paper also conducts extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
