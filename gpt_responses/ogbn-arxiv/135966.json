This falls under the category of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). The use of SAT-solvers and encodings for solving this problem suggests a focus on Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The discussion of different encodings and their performance also suggests a focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the use of SAT-solvers for improving the lower bound demonstrates a focus on Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
