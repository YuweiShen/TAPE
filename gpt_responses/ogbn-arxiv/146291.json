Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning architectures, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The authors also mention the use of a prototype naive combination of the two methods, which could be related to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the methods in challenging conditions, which could be relevant to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
