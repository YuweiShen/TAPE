Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The tool is also designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, which suggests a human-computer interaction aspect, making cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) a likely sub-category as well. The tool can be used for crowdsourced annotation, which relates to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also mentions the importance of abundant and reliable data for deep learning models, which suggests a possible connection to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
