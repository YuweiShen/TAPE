The use of game theory to solve the motion planning problem suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and systems and control (cs.SY). The algorithm proposed in the paper involves computation and optimization, which are common themes in artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
