This technique has applications in computer graphics (e.g. rasterization of depth-of-field blur), computational geometry (e.g. Poisson-disk sampling), and numerical analysis (e.g. estimation of probability of failure). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.GR (Graphics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
