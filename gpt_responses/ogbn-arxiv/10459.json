The paper also discusses the mathematical properties of infinitely divisible random variables, which is related to statistics (cs.ST) and mathematical physics (cs.MS). Finally, the paper's focus on performance analysis of wireless systems could also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
