The paper proposes a new algorithm for mixture proportion estimation, which is a problem that arises in many weakly supervised learning problems. The algorithm is based on embedding distributions onto an RKHS and solving a simple convex quadratic programming problem. The paper also provides convergence rates under certain assumptions on the distribution. Given these characteristics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
