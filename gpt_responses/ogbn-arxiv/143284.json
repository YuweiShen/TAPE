The paper focuses on developing a similarity metric based on a deep, fully convolutional embedding model and a grouping method based on selecting all points that are sufficiently similar to a set of \"seed points\" chosen from a deep, fully convolutional scoring model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
