The paper also introduces a new form of shared reduction, which is a logical concept. \n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper deals with the computational complexity of \u03bb-terms, which is a topic of interest in programming languages. The paper also introduces a new calculus of explicit substitutions, which is a programming language concept. \n3. cs.TL (Theoretical Computer Science) - The paper deals with the theoretical aspects of computation, such as the invariance thesis and the size-explosion problem. The paper also introduces a new form of evaluation, which is a theoretical concept. \n4. cs.LG (Learning) - The paper does not directly deal with machine learning, but the concept of invariance is relevant to the field of learning, as it is a desirable property for models. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper deals with the computational complexity of \u03bb-terms, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory. The paper also introduces a new form of evaluation that is linearly related to the size of the output, which is a complexity-theoretic concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
