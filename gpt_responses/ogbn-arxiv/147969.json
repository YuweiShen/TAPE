This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-disciplines, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), multimedia (cs.MM), multiagent systems (cs.MA), and systems and control (cs.SY). Given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories. However, the use of directional antennas and the resulting improvement in system performance also touches on topics related to hardware design (cs.MM), optimization (cs.MA), and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
