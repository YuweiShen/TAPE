The use of deep learning also suggests that it could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithm that uses both pairwise label information and classification information, which is a common approach in supervised learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
