This is a common topic in AI research.\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) - The paper discusses the limitations of first-order logic and proposes a new representation that subsumes both FOL and MILP. This is a core topic in logic in computer science.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper establishes formal methods for reasoning about first-order programs, including a sound and complete lifted inference procedure for integer first-order programs. This involves algorithmic techniques and data structures.\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes a new programming language, called first-order programming, which subsumes both FOL and MILP. This is a topic in programming languages research.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper discusses the limitations of MILP and proposes a new representation that can offer exponential savings in representation and proof size compared to FOL. This involves mathematical concepts and techniques from discrete mathematics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
