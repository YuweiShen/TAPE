The paper also proposes a new loss function for optimization, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of the proposed method on semantic segmentation pipeline, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
