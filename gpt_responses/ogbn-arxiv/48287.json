The proposed method involves learning a single model to handle multiple degradations, which requires a certain level of scalability and generalization, suggesting that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also relevant sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of synthetic and real LR images, which implies that multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
