The paper also proposes a novel time-coupling constraint, which involves considering the delay-sensitivity of sources, and incorporates it into the rate allocation algorithm. This constraint is related to control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper proposes a distributed algorithm for rate allocation, which involves communication between different nodes in the network, and thus falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
