The use of different loss functions for pretraining is a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which could be of interest to researchers in neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
