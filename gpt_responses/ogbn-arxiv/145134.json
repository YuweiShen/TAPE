The proposed algorithm involves change-based evaluation of CNNs, which is a technique for reducing the computational cost of per-frame evaluation. This technique involves exploiting the spatio-temporal sparsity of pixel changes, which is a concept that is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which is a topic that is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
