The paper also mentions the use of polar codes, which are a popular coding scheme in the field of signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). The paper discusses the use of low-complexity coding schemes, which is a topic of interest in the field of distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the erasure relay channel as a running example, which is a specific type of network topology that falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
