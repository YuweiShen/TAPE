The approach uses BERT for generating contextual representations, introduces a Gaussian probability distribution to capture local structure, and applies attention mechanism to fuse title information and biomedical knowledge. The paper falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) for biomedical applications, which is covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. Specifically, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category as it covers NLP and information extraction. cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also likely as the paper proposes a neural network-based approach. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is relevant as the paper deals with extracting information from biomedical literature. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible sub-categories as the paper proposes a novel neural network-based approach for improving CPI extraction performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
