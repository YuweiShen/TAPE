The experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets for image classification (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet), indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of meta-learning approaches, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of dropout, weight decay, and batch normalization, which are common techniques in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of DNNs on different datasets, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
