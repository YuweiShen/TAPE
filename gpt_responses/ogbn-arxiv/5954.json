The proposed method involves using a recurrent network to extract long-term context information, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a transition-aware classifier, which involves making decisions based on the state of the system, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on video datasets, which is a common application of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with detecting actions in videos, which is a common application of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
