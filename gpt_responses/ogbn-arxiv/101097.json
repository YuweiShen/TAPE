The use of potential functions and gradient-based control laws also suggests a connection to optimization and numerical analysis (cs.NA). However, the focus on distributed coordination and formation control, as well as the use of matrix calculus, suggests that the paper is most likely to belong to the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
