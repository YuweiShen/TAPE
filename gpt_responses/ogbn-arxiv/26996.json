The use of deep learning systems and probe datasets suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the evaluation of the learning system, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) or robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
