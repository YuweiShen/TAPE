It also involves studying the security aspect of the channel, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of multiple antennas at the transmitters and receivers suggests that the paper may also be related to the field of multimedia communications (cs.MM). The paper also involves the study of channel matrices, which is a common topic in network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of achieving secure degrees of freedom, which is a topic in the field of secure information transmission (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
