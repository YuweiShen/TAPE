The paper introduces parameterized approximations for ATSP and discusses their performance in experiments. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.DM (discrete mathematics), cs.CG (computational geometry), cs.CC (computational complexity), and cs.GT (computational game theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
