The paper proposes a simple algorithm for building a decoder for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) task, which is a continuous control task that can model a wide range of real-world physical environments. The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance and provides experimental results. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
