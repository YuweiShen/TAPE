The paper also discusses the advantages of both model-based and model-free RL approaches, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of linear-Gaussian policies and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The fact that the method can be combined with guided policy search (GPS) to train arbitrary parameterized policies such as deep neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of simulation and real-world experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
