This involves using an approximate forward model that introduces aliasing artefacts in the gradient information for the iterative reconstruction. The paper then proposes a CNN that can use the approximate information to perform an iterative reconstruction. Given that the paper involves both computer vision and machine learning techniques, it is likely to belong to the cs.CV and cs.LG sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.IT and cs.NA sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves medical imaging, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
