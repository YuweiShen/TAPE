This topic is closely related to network infrastructure (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also involves optimization and control theory (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of iterative decomposition methods and the potential impact on delay minimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
