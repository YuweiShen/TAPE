The proposed Information Retention Network (IR-Net) addresses the information loss in both forward and backward propagation, which is related to optimization (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper presents technical contributions such as Libra Parameter Binarization and Error Decay Estimator, which are relevant to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
