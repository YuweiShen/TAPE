The proposed network architecture involves information fusion and temporal transformation, which are also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of motion vectors from compressed video stream as an alternative to optical flow, which relates to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
