The use of coding and decoding techniques also suggests that the paper may belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of space-time codes and their performance in MIMO systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
