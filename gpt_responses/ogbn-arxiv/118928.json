It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as object pose estimation is an important task in robotics. The use of neural networks for reconstruction and rendering suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the creation of a new dataset suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
