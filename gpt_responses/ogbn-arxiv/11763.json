The use of short messages is a key aspect of the paper, which could also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves analyzing the expressive power of a class of quantum interactive proof systems, which could be seen as a problem in data structures (cs.DS) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
