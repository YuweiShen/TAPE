It also involves image and video processing techniques. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a novel scheme for training 2-bit CNNs. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with the practical application of complex activity detection on portable devices. The paper also involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it proposes a new model called DFTerNet. Finally, it involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with sensor-based games and multi-sensor collaboration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
