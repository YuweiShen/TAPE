Specifically, it focuses on lossy compression scenarios where the application tolerates some distortion of the gathered signal in return for improved energy efficiency. This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as network infrastructure (cs.NI), control systems (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
