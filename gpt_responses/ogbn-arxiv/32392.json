However, the main focus of the paper is on information theory (IT) and communication (COM), as it studies the spectral efficiency of the network. The paper also deals with network infrastructure (NI) and signal processing (SI), as it considers the impact of pilot contamination and different degrees of channel state information on the performance of the network. Finally, the paper deals with massive MIMO (MM), which is a specific area of research within wireless communication that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. Based on these considerations, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SI, cs.MM, and cs.COM, in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
