The paper provides tight lower bounds for this problem, which is a fundamental result in the field of bandit algorithms. Given the focus on optimization and machine learning, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.GT (Game Theory), as these fields are closely related to the Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
