It also presents a task-based partner-aware robot control technique, which involves human-robot collaboration and communication (cs.HC). The coupled-dynamics formalism and the approach to exploiting helpful interaction with a humanoid robot involve system dynamics and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions using machine learning techniques to improve the robot's performance (cs.AI) and presents experimental results to validate the theoretical findings (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
