This involves defining a value function that can be used to evaluate the quality of a state in the game. The paper also includes an empirical study that shows how neural networks can be used to approximate value functions in different domains. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.GT (game theory), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing), and cs.SY (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
