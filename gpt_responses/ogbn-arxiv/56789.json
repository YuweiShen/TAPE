This involves using features from shallower layers as inputs for training the next deeper layer. The paper also compares the proposed framework with existing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on benchmark problems related to computer vision and natural language processing, which suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
