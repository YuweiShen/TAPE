The paper compares two different representations for observation and action spaces in DRL, which is a common topic in the sub-category of AI (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the performance of these representations, which is a common topic in the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses game theory and decision making, which are common topics in the sub-category of Game Theory (cs.GT). The paper also mentions computer vision, which is a common topic in the sub-category of Computer Vision (cs.CV).
