The approach involves the use of a lexical parser to extract control statements and method identifiers from Java programs, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The proposed similarity measure and retrieval algorithm involve the use of sequence-based similarity, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the experiments involve the comparison of different retrieval models, which is related to databases (cs.DB) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
