This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo dropout, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses the BraTS dataset, which is a widely used benchmark in medical image analysis and falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
