Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a general attack algorithm and evaluates the efficacy of physical adversarial manipulations, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of DNNs in safety-critical situations, which relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
