Additionally, the paper validates the proposed method on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and Food-101 datasets, which are commonly used in machine learning research. The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with deep convolutional neural networks and image datasets. The use of Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) as it proposes a new method for pruning deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
