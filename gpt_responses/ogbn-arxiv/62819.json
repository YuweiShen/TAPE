This work involves the use of deep learning techniques such as DNN and CNN, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper focuses on recognition tasks, which are often associated with the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the architecture on resource-limited platforms, which falls under the sub-category of cs.ET (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
