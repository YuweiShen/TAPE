This is a topic that falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of interval Markov decision processes (IMDP) and convex optimization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the state-space explosion problem, which is a common issue in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the approach, which is a topic that falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
