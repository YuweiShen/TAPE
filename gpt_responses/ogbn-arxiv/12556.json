The scheme combines formalisms of abstraction and inheritance hierarchies, which are commonly used in machine learning and knowledge representation (cs.LG). The paper also discusses probabilistic networks, which are commonly used in decision analysis and probabilistic reasoning (cs.SI). The application of the scheme to an automated machining problem involves data analysis and decision-making, which are relevant to data science (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
