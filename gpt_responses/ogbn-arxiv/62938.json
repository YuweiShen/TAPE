The paper also explores the performance of different CNN architectures, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the evaluation of the models is done on benchmark datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
