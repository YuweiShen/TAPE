It also benchmarks two low size, weight, and power (SWaP) accelerators, which could fall under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM) or systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses power consumption and inference versus training, which could fall under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper is relevant to the field of augmented reality (cs.AR) as machine learning accelerators can be used to improve the performance of AR applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
