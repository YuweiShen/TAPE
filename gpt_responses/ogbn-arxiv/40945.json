The method uses causal dilated convolutions, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a triplet loss, which is a common technique in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
