The use of determinants and polynomials also suggests a connection to algebraic complexity theory (cs.AC). However, since the paper focuses on the combinatorial aspects of determinantal projections and monomial sets, rather than their algebraic properties, we consider the other sub-categories to be more likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
