This is a core problem in computer vision, and the paper uses several computer vision techniques such as 360-image, 2D image-based layout, and planar patches for hybrid representations. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): Relative pose estimation is a crucial problem in robotics, especially for tasks such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The paper proposes a method that can output multiple relative poses, which is useful for robotics applications. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a global-2-local matching procedure that utilizes initial relative poses obtained during the global phase to detect and then integrate geometric relations for pose refinement. This involves machine learning techniques such as feature representations and pose refinement. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves scene completion and matching of completed scans, which are important problems in computer graphics. The paper proposes hybrid representations that combine different types of representations for scene completion, which is a graphics-related problem. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach for relative pose estimation that involves several AI techniques such as scene completion, matching, and feature representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
