This makes it likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the conversion of non-clausal formulas to CNF, which involves logical reasoning and inference, making it relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The proposed score function is computed in linear time, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category, as it deals with the complexity of solving satisfiability problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
