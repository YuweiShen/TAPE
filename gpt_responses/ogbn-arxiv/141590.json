The use of tree automata suggests a connection to formal language theory and computational complexity (CC). The system also involves data structures and algorithms (DS) for storing and querying the indexes, and compression techniques (DL) for reducing memory consumption."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
