This paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as it deals with the classification of semantic relations in scientific literature. It may also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as the task involves identifying relevant information from a large corpus of scientific literature. Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) are also possible sub-categories as the paper uses embeddings and classification algorithms to perform the task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
