Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep learning-based object detection and optical flow methods, which are common techniques in machine learning and multimedia processing, respectively. Hence, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories. Additionally, the paper involves training a combined detector for text and logo, which involves optimizing the performance of the algorithm, indicating that it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
