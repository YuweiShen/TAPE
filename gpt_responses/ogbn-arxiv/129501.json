The paper focuses on the application of this approach to a clinically relevant task (sleep scoring) and demonstrates its effectiveness in low data regimes. Given the focus on machine learning and the use of EEG signals, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) due to the use of EEG signals, cs.CV (Computer Vision) due to the focus on learning informative representations, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) due to the use of machine learning techniques, and cs.CL (Computation and Language) due to the potential for natural language processing applications in the sleep scoring task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
