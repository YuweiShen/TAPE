This suggests that the paper could belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the dynamics of the primary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, which suggests that it could also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of deep reinforcement learning algorithm for deriving an optimal transaction transmission policy suggests that the paper could also belong to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves decision-making and optimization, which suggests that it could belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of cognitive radio networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
