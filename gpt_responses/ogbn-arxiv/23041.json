The problem involves a noisy channel, and the absence of channel state information or transmission feedback at the sensor. These characteristics suggest that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Networked Systems (cs.NI), Machine Learning (cs.MA), and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
