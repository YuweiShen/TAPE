The focus is on block-sparse signals, which is a specific type of sparsity structure, making cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.SI (social and information networks) also possible categories. Finally, the paper proposes algorithms for efficient recovery, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
