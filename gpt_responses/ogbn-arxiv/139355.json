The problem involves packing a set of rectangular items into a strip with bounded width and infinite height, with the objective of minimizing the packing height. This problem is closely related to other problems in computational geometry and combinatorial optimization, such as bin packing, cutting stock, and scheduling. \n\nGiven the problem's nature, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithm for Strip Packing with a better approximation ratio than the previous best-known algorithm. The algorithm uses a structural result that applies to other problem settings as well. This suggests that the paper involves the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. \n\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The problem of Strip Packing is a classic problem in computational geometry, and the paper deals with the problem's approximation algorithms. The paper also presents a structural result that applies to other problem settings, which suggests that the paper involves the study of geometric structures and algorithms. \n\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The problem of Strip Packing is a combinatorial optimization problem, and the paper deals with the problem's approximation algorithms.
