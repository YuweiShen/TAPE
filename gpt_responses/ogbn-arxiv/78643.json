This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the application of ES in humanoid locomotion, which falls under the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the unique robustness-seeking property of ES, which could be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
