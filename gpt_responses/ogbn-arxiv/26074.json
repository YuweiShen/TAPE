The use of multiple antennas to increase capacity is a common technique in wireless communication, and therefore this paper could also be classified under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The analysis of the impact of quantized feedback on the system performance involves control theory and system dynamics (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas also has implications for multimedia processing (cs.MM), as it can improve the quality of video and audio transmissions. Finally, the paper involves the use of mathematical models and statistical analysis to derive expressions for system performance, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
