The use of ADCs and the issue of dynamic range suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SP). The paper's focus on recovering signals with large amplitudes suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.MM) or large-scale data analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the use of numerical experiments suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
