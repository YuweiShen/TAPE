Additionally, the paper discusses the allocation of resources within a cloud, which falls under the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper also mentions the control of tradeoffs between security, price, and performance, which is related to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category. The use of firmware and software attestation to ensure secure communication between servers falls under the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses a prototype that demonstrates scalable end-to-end security, which is related to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
