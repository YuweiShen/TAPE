Therefore, cs.CL and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces a regularization scheme for higher-order tensor networks, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), making cs.LG and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of the proposed architecture with other recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without external memory, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
