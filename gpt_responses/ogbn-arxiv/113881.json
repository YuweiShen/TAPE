This topic falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which are covered by the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories. The paper also uses game theory concepts, which are covered by the cs.GT sub-category. The paper also discusses Monte Carlo selection problems, which are related to computational statistics and data analysis, covered by the cs.DS sub-category.
