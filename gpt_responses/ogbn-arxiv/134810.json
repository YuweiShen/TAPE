The paper discusses the use of classification models to predict the quality of different frequency bands based on the UE location and spectral correlation between radio frequency signals. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
