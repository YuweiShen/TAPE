The paper focuses on the use of DTLS, a security protocol commonly used in IoT, and proposes a hardware-based solution to address the computational cost associated with software-only implementations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the categories of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Embedded Systems (cs.ET), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Architecture (cs.AR), and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
