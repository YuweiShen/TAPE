This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category covers research on logic and its applications in computer science, including automated reasoning and theorem proving.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of AI, including knowledge representation, reasoning, and automated deduction.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category covers research on programming languages and their semantics, including formal methods and verification.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of software engineering, including formal methods and software verification.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of machine learning, including automated reasoning and theorem proving. While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of external ATPs can be seen as a form of machine learning in which the system learns from past examples to improve its performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
