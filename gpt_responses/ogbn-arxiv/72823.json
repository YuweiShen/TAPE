This involves collecting user interactions with a live streaming platform to detect highlights. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) categories. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques to collect time-stamped chat messages, which suggests it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) categories. Finally, the paper uses iterative refinement techniques to improve highlight extraction, which could involve computer vision techniques, indicating that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
