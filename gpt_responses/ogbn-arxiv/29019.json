Additionally, the paper discusses the human visual perception system, which is closely related to the field of computer vision. The paper also mentions multi-task auxiliary learning, which is a common technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of subjective attention and task intention also suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the experimental verification of the proposed theory may involve the use of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
