The paper also discusses the integration of cross-domain networks, which could fall under the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The proposed evaluation metric and mathematical formulations suggest that the paper could also belong to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories.
