This problem is related to data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the size of the data structures, which is related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and data management (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents algorithms for both single source and all-pairs versions of the problem, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
