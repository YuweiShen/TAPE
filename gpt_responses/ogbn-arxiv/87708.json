This involves optimising two objectives - maximising the number of released PMs and minimising the number of VM migrations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed algorithm involves optimisation using ant colony system, which is a type of evolutionary algorithm. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with virtual machine consolidation in cloud data centres, which is a distributed computing problem. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed algorithm involves optimisation using ant colony system, which is a type of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimising the allocation of virtual machines to physical machines in cloud data centres, which can be seen as a control problem. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed algorithm involves optimisation using ant colony system, which can be seen as a type of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
