The use of multi-stage features and Lp pooling also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the benefits of different pooling methods, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
