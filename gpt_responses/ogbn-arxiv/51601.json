Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for generating CAM using multiple classification models, which is a common approach in computer vision research. The paper also mentions the use of hierarchical clustering, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The proposed method also involves the use of a new orthogonal module, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
