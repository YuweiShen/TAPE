The authors propose a new approach for generating adversarial examples that maintain the executability and functionality of the original input, which involves the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and deep learning models (cs.LG). The approach also involves visualization-based techniques for malware detection (cs.CV) and has implications for software engineering (cs.SE) in terms of improving the robustness of malware detection systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
