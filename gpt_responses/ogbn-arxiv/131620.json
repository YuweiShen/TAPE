This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of CapsNets also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a modified architecture for CapsNets, which involves the use of tumor coarse boundaries as extra inputs, indicating the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
