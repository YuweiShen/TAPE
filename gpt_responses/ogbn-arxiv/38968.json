The paper also discusses the impact of channel characteristics and power allocation on the system performance, which is related to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses numerical simulations to evaluate the proposed scheme, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to secure wireless communication systems, which can be considered as a system-level solution and falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
