The focus on obtaining efficient bounds also suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) as a likely sub-category. The use of algorithms to derive these bounds suggests discrete mathematics (cs.DM) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the implementation aspect of the paper suggests programming languages (cs.PL) as a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
