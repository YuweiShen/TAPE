It proposes a solution using deep reinforcement learning and evaluates it through simulations and hardware experiments using state-of-the-art vision DNNs. The paper's focus on robotics, machine learning, and computer vision makes cs.RO, cs.LG, and cs.CV the most likely categories. The use of wireless networks and communication also suggests cs.SY and cs.NI as possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
