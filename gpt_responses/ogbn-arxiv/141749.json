This aligns with the focus of cs.CY on the social and ethical implications of computing technologies. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper explores the landscape of environmental community action and the role of technology in facilitating or hindering such action. This aligns with the focus of cs.SI on the study of social networks and their impact on information dissemination and collective behavior. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses design fieldwork with government, private, and public interest stakeholders to inform research on mobile environmental sensing. This aligns with the focus of cs.HC on the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper describes the development and deployment of an environmental air quality sensing system on street sweeping vehicles. This aligns with the focus of cs.SY on the analysis, design, and control of complex systems. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the use of mobile sensing platforms raises potential security and privacy concerns that may be relevant to cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
