This involves defining nested term graphs based on a signature that is partitioned into atomic and nested function symbols, and inducing corresponding notions of bisimulation between nested term graphs. The paper also discusses the implementation of nested term graphs using first-order term graphs. Given these topics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.TL (Term Rewriting), cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
