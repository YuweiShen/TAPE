This falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the use of ATP and ITP involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of Elfe, which is a software tool, and software engineering (cs.SE) is relevant in this context. Finally, the paper discusses the use of formalized mathematics (cs.ET) in teaching axiomatic geometry to students."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
