The approach is based on statistical signal processing and decision theory, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper demonstrates the practical interest of the approach in a large-scale image search scenario, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
