This approach is related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) due to its focus on optimizing neural network architectures for image classification tasks. Additionally, the use of regression models and random search is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
