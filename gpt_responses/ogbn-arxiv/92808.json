This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes an autonomous compressive spectrum sensing framework for cognitive radios, which involves networking and internet architecture aspects.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The proposed framework can be applied to social and information networks, as it enables a CR to autonomously choose the number of measurements while guaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery error.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm that bridges the gap between CS theory and practical spectrum sensing, which involves systems and control aspects.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the performance of the proposed framework and algorithm in recovering wideband spectrum, which can be considered as a multimedia application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
