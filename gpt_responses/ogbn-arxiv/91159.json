It also involves logical reasoning and consistency properties, which are relevant to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The comparisons between DeLP and ASPIC+ involve notions of closure and consistency, which are also relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the properties of attacks and justifications, which are relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the rationality postulates of argumentation, which are relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
