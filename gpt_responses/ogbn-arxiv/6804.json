Specifically, the paper proposes two novel algorithms for off-policy temporal difference learning. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
