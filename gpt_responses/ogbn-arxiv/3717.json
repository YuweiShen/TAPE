The paper proposes a new learning paradigm for keyphrase generation and examines the effects of ordering on models' behavior. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is focused on NLP. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) and artificial intelligence (AI) topics, which could place it under cs.IR and cs.AI, respectively. Finally, deep learning (DL) is a common technique used in NLP, so cs.DL is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
