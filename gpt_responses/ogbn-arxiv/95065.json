The paper specifically focuses on the use of pulsed electromagnetic fault injection, which is related to electromagnetic compatibility (cs.EM) and hardware security (cs.AR). The evaluation of the countermeasure schemes involves practical implementation and testing, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
