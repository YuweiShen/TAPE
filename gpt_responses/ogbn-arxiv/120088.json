This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses entropy and approximation algorithms, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses practical applications of summary trees, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
