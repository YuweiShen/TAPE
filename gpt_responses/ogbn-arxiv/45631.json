Therefore, it is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Autostacker is a machine learning system, so it is highly likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to the development of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. Autostacker can be seen as an intelligent agent that searches for the best machine learning pipeline, so it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and analysis of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. Autostacker uses an evolutionary algorithm to search for the best machine learning pipeline, so it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers topics related to the analysis and interpretation of visual data. Autostacker does not focus on visual data, but it can be applied to any type of data, including images. Therefore, it is also possible that it belongs to this sub-category"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
