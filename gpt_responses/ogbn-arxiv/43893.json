The paper also discusses the use of proto-graphs and Tanner graphs, which are relevant to network coding (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) applications. Finally, the paper presents explicit code constructions and upper bounds on minimum distance, which are topics of interest in the algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
