The paper also presents a new method for proving outer bounds for linear coding, which could be relevant to the sub-category of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities, which could be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also deals with network topology and connectivity, which could be relevant to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses coding techniques, which could be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
