The proposed method involves dropout, which is a popular regularization technique in artificial intelligence (AI) research. The experiments involve analyzing image and video data, which are common in multimedia (MM) research. Finally, the paper also discusses the robustness of the method against attacks, which is a topic in computer security (CR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
