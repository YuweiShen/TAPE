The primary focus is on network infrastructure (cs.NI), as the system is designed to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies in real-time. The paper also discusses security (cs.CR) and distributed systems (cs.DC), as the system is designed to be scalable and able to handle large amounts of data. Additionally, the system could be applied to control systems (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) for analyzing and processing the collected data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
