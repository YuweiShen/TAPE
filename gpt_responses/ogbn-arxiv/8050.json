This problem is closely related to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses approximation algorithms for grammar-based compressors, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper uses a family of words defined over a binary alphabet, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
