Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of a fixed sensing matrix, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) and optics and photonics (cs.OH) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents simulations of the proposed architecture, which could be considered under the signal processing (cs.SP) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
