Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization and graph algorithms, which are topics related to information theory and computer science. Hence, cs.IT (Information Theory) is also a likely category. The paper proposes a hierarchical approach to resource allocation, which involves estimating the load of each FAP and allocating physical resource blocks to FAPs. This hierarchical approach is related to topics such as distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also involves interference management, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
