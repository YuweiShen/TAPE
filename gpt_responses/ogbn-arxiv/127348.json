The use of proof-labeling schemes and boolean predicates on network states suggests that the paper could also fit in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The focus on local verification of certificates and the use of adjacency lists suggest that the paper could belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of linearly proportional detection of illegal states suggests that the paper could also fit in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the use of certificates on a limited number of bits suggests that the paper could also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
