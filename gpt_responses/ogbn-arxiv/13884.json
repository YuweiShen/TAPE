The paper presents a general approach to deriving inapproximability results in the value oracle model, which is a common model used in the study of submodular maximization problems. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.GT (computational game theory), cs.CC (computational complexity), cs.IT (information theory), and cs.LG (machine learning). Among these, cs.DS and cs.GT are the most likely categories, as the paper deals with optimization problems and their approximability, which are central topics in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
