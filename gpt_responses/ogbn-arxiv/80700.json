The application of this framework is demonstrated on a real-world industrial application of traffic light detection, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the challenges of regulatory acceptance of safety-critical systems, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of black-box nature of DNNs, which could fall under cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
