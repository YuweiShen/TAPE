The paper also discusses the use of a multi-armed bandit approach for algorithm selection, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments in the paper involve image classification tasks, which are often studied in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the importance of considering limited time budgets and computational resources, which are relevant topics in data science (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
