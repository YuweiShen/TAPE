The use of thesaurus- and co-occurrence-based approaches for query expansion is evaluated, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper deals with data management and archives, which could fall under databases (cs.DB) and digital libraries (cs.DL). Finally, the social science aspect of the paper could also relate to computational social science (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
