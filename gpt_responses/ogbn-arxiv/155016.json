The paper also discusses the use of chaotic iterations, which is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves simulations and analysis of the generated numbers, which falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NI) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
