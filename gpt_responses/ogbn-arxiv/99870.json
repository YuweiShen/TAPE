The paper also presents a new framework for computation using discrete ODEs and provides characterizations of complexity and computability classes. This suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
