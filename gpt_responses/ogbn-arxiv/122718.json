Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with aerial images. The paper proposes a self-supervised training procedure, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with deep learning.
