The use of dropout layers in neural networks is also a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve both regression and classification tasks, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the use of determinantal point processes-based sampling is a technique commonly used in neural network ensembles (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
