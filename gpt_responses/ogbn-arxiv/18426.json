The use of constellations for compressing descriptions of places visited by robots involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The method for extracting compact spatial and semantic descriptors of objects in a scene involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method for decentralized loop closure verification involves both machine learning and control systems (cs.LG and cs.SY). Overall, the paper covers a range of topics that could fit into multiple sub-categories, but the focus on robotics and computer vision make cs.RO and cs.CV the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
