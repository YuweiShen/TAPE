This suggests that the paper could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), or Security and Cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of algorithms to detect fake views in real-time, which could fall under the Streaming and Online Algorithms (cs.SI) sub-category.
