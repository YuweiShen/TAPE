The focus is on anonymous graphs, where the agents have no unique identifiers, which is a topic of interest in the area of self-stabilization (cs.DS) and fault-tolerant computing (cs.AL). The use of time as a means to break symmetry is a novel approach, which may have applications in synchronization (cs.SI) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
