The paper proposes a novel probabilistic learning objective that models the uncertainty in the location of objects using a dissimilarity coefficient. This objective is optimized using deep learning frameworks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the complexity of the conditional distribution, which suggests that it may fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the experiments are conducted on image data sets, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
