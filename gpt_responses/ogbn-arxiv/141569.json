The paper also discusses the communication complexity of these methods, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC). Information theory (cs.IT) is also relevant as the paper considers different assumptions on the information available to individual machines. The paper also discusses the types of functions considered, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper considers cases where machines have unbounded computational power, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
