The paper also involves the optimization of the protocol's performance, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm and multi-packet reception (MPR) capability in the proposed protocol involves signal processing and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also deals with the problem of collisions in VLC systems, which is a security and cryptography issue (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a distributed algorithm for the random access protocol, which falls under computer networking and internet architecture (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
