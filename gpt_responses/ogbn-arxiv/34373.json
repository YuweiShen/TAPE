The approach combines visual and textual features, which suggests relevance to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The use of deep learning techniques and the investigation of predictive power and generalization capacity also point towards machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on information extraction from historical documents suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
