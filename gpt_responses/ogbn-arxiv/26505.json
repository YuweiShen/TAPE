The construction of disjunct matrices and their relaxed version, almost disjunct matrices, involves combinatorial designs (cs.DM) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the analysis of the average distance of constant weight codes, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
