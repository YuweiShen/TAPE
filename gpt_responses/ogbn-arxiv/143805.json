Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves crawling YouTube videos, which is related to multimedia processing (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The filtering and post-processing steps mentioned in the paper also involve signal processing techniques, which are related to cs.SD (Sound). Finally, the paper discusses the use of deep neural networks, which is related to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
