The use of a convolutional neural network for learning a similarity metric suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The tracking aspect of the paper suggests that it may also fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of appearance metrics and tracklets suggests that the paper may also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
