The application domain is medical imaging (cs.MED), specifically intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images of coronary arteries. The use of transfer learning, where pre-trained CNN models are fine-tuned for the specific task, is also mentioned, which is a common technique in both computer vision and machine learning. Finally, the paper also mentions the potential use of neural networks for automatic plaque detection, which falls under the domain of computational neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
