The paper discusses the use of physical-layer interference models and mode selection to achieve these goals. Given the focus on networking and communication, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses information theory and channel capacity, suggesting cs.IT (Information Theory) as another likely category. The use of control signaling and distributed orchestration of base stations and user equipment suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a possible category. The paper also discusses the use of simulation studies and implementation using open-source software, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
