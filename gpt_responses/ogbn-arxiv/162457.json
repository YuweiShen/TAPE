The paper also discusses the use of data fusion and machine learning techniques, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of millimeter wave frequencies for positioning also falls under the category of millimeter wave technology (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of received signal strength intensity (RSSI) for positioning, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
