Additionally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial manipulations, which is a security concern (cs.CR). The paper also uses image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, which are commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CV). The proposed method of region-based classification is a novel approach to defending against evasion attacks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of ensembling to predict labels, which is a technique commonly used in neural network research (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
