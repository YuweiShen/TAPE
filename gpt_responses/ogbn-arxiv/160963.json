The proposed approach involves learning word sense representations and a sense selection mechanism given contexts. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
