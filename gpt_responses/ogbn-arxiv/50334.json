This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses automatic disaggregation methods to estimate the energy demand of constituent loads. This involves the use of machine learning techniques.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to the above, the use of automatic disaggregation methods involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper may involve the development of software for implementing the proposed measurement system and automatic disaggregation methods.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The proposed measurement system may involve the use of embedded systems for monitoring the voltage and current of the aggregate load."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
