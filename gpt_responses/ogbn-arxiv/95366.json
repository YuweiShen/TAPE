The paper also discusses the hardness of the problem, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of algorithms to find evacuation plans suggests the paper could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or search and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
