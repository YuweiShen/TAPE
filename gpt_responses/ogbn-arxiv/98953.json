The method proposed in the paper involves using a language model to generate a skeleton sentence and attribute phrases separately, which requires machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its algorithm using different evaluation metrics, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
