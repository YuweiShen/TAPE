The paper also proposes a neural network-based approach to improve the performance of session-based recommendation, which is a popular research area in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also uses natural language processing techniques to extract user-side contexts, which is a common research area in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category.
