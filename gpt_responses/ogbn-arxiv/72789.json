The paper uses both video and audio features to predict emotions, which suggests that it could belong to multiple sub-categories. However, given the emphasis on multimodal models and the use of pre-trained neural networks for feature extraction from video, cs.MM (Multimedia) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the use of RGB frames and optical flow for video feature extraction suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep neural network models for classification, which could fall under cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing for feature extraction from audio, which could also fall under cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
