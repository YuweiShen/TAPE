The paper proposes a novel method for controlling the length of the summary, which involves incorporating a word-level extractive module in the encoder-decoder model. This approach involves using machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two datasets, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
