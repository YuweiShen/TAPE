The paper proposes a semi-supervised approach to NAS, which involves using unlabeled data to improve the controller. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also applies the approach to text-to-speech task, which falls under the sub-category cs.CL (Computation and Language) and uses computational resources, which falls under the sub-category cs.SD (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
