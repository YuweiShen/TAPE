This falls under the category of optimization and machine learning. Specifically, the use of Gaussian process surrogate models suggests a focus on neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE), while the optimization aspect suggests categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
