The use of ontology and domain information extraction also suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). The paper also deals with metadata representation and linked data, which are relevant to Database (cs.DB) and Semantic Web (cs.SE) sub-categories. Finally, the use of ranked search results and machine learning techniques for improving retrieval performance suggests a connection to Deep Learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
