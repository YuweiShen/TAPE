The problems studied in the paper involve solving systems of polynomial equations, which is a common problem in scientific computing (cs.SC). The use of isolating regions and separating forms suggests a connection to real algebraic geometry (cs.DS), while the computation of the topology of a curve suggests a connection to computational topology (cs.SY). Finally, the use of bit complexity analysis suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
