The paper also discusses power allocation and beamforming for downlink NOMA, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The discussion of coordinated and uncoordinated transmissions for uplink NOMA suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia) as NOMA is a potential technology for improving multimedia transmission. Finally, the discussion of NOMA in cellular systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
