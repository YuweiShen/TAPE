Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the implementation of the theory in a proof assistant, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also deals with category theory and homotopy theory, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CT (Computational Topology), respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the use of SSTs in higher category theory, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
