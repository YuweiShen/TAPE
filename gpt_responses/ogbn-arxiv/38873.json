This involves using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to map pairs of compatible or incompatible items from a symbolic word space to an embedded style space. Given this focus on image and text processing, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational linguistics (cs.CL).
