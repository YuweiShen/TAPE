This is a core topic in software engineering.\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the role of stakeholders (e.g., project managers, quality assurance manager, developers) in the execution of a software development project. This has implications for the social and ethical aspects of software development.\n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper mentions the development of a Software Project Control Center (SPCC) for systematic quality assurance and management support. This may involve the use of programming languages for data visualization and analysis.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper discusses the need for context-, purpose-, and role-oriented information for all stakeholders during the execution of a software development project. This has implications for the design of user interfaces and interaction techniques.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the collection, interpretation, and visualization of measurement data in order to provide information for all stakeholders. This may involve the use of social and information networks for data analysis and visualization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
