The method involves extracting versatile features that are effective across all source subjects and adapting the model to the target subject. This approach is based on meta learning and aims to find feature representations that are broadly suitable for different subjects. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
