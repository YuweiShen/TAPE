It is also likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as efficient implementations of tensor operators are key enablers of effective deep learning systems, which are often used in computer vision and artificial intelligence applications. Additionally, it may belong to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category as the paper discusses the limitations of relying on hardware-specific operator libraries and the need for high-level graph optimizations that can be applied across different hardware targets. Finally, it may belong to the architecture (cs.AR) sub-category as it discusses the engineering costs associated with deploying to new hardware targets and the need for effective model transfer across workloads."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
