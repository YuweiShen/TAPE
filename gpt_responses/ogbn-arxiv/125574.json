It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as 3D object detection is an important task in robotics. Additionally, the paper proposes an end-to-end trainable model, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves geometric constraints and projections, which suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
