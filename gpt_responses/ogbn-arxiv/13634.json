The paper proposes a CNN-based approach to solve this problem on a single sunny day. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also deals with the problem of recovering surface normals from photometric cues, which involves understanding the geometry of the scene. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category cs.GR (Graphics). \n\nThe paper uses a CNN to learn priors on material properties and surface geometry, which involves training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to solve the problem of photometric stereo, which involves combining photometric cues with prior knowledge on material properties and surface geometry. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a method that can estimate surface normals from outdoor images, which involves understanding the geometry of the scene and the lighting conditions. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
