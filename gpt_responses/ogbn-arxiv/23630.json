The paper also discusses the successful application of the proposed method in a railway surveillance system, which indicates the potential relevance to artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NE) fields. Additionally, the paper involves experiments on ImageNet, which is a popular dataset in multimedia (MM) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
