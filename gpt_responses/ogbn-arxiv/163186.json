The use of Level-3 BLAS-based procedures also suggests a numerical analysis approach. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithmic variants of standard procedures to overcome performance bottlenecks, which is a typical problem in data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the use of singular value problems suggests a possible connection to machine learning applications. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): There is no clear connection to social and information networks in the paper. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper does not deal with symbolic computation, but rather with numerical methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
