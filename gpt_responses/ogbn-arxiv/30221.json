However, the focus on spectral embedding methods and the use of Procrustes analysis suggest that the paper is most likely to belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Other possible sub-categories include Machine Learning (cs.LG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), and Systems and Control (cs.SY), as these areas also deal with similar mathematical and computational techniques. However, the emphasis on network analysis and change detection makes cs.SI the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
