The paper also proposes practical algorithms for \"memorizing\" information about the training dataset, which is a core topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The specific tasks evaluated in the paper, such as image classification and face recognition, are also commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of ML frameworks and services for non-experts suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the practical implementation of these algorithms may involve data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
