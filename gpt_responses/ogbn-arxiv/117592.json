Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP and ML for text processing. The paper also discusses the use of a passage ranker to select high-quality passages, which falls under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper proposes a globally normalized BERT model, which involves optimization and training techniques, and thus could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of sliding window to split articles into passages, which could be related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
