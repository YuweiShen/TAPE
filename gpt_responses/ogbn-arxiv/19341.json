This problem is related to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.CC). The Lyndon array is also used in string compression (cs.IT) and pattern matching (cs.DM). Finally, the paper includes experimental results, which suggests that it may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) researchers interested in efficient string processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
