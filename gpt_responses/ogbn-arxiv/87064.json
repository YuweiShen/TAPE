The paper focuses on investigating the search behavior of users in information retrieval systems, which is a common topic in the field of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The use of eye tracking data and log analysis also suggests a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI). Additionally, the paper deals with the use of search terms and their variations, which is a common topic in Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The use of large-scale log analysis also suggests a focus on Deep Learning (cs.DL) and Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
