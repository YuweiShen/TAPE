Information theory concepts such as entropy rate and channel capacity are also mentioned. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image transmission and compression, which falls under the multimedia domain. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves image processing and transmission, which is a key area of computer vision. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with transmission over a deep-space communication channel, which is a networking and internet architecture problem. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a major focus of the paper, the use of Raptor codes for error correction can be seen as a security measure to ensure reliable transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
