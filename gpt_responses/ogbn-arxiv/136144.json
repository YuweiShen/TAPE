Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the neural architecture, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The proposed modifications to the equivariant feature mappings involve attending to relevant transformations in the data, which is a form of attention mechanism and falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the performance of the neural networks on rotated MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks and fall under the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the use of multiple symmetries in the proposed co-attentive equivariant neural networks, which falls under the sub-category cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
