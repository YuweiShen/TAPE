This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of reinforcement learning and network embedding also suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories.
