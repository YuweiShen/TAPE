The main technical contribution is the efficient construction of hopsets on directed graphs, which is a key component in many algorithms for the approximate shortest-path problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry), which are all closely related to graph theory and algorithms. Additionally, since the paper presents a parallel algorithm, it is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
