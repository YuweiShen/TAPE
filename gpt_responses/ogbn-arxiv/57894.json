Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also deals with multimedia documents, which suggests cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of intelligent stimuli retrieval applications indicates the involvement of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely category. The paper also mentions the use of real-life videos, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the need for better stimuli descriptions and annotations could involve information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
