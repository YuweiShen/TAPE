This involves using sketches to estimate factors of the graphical model, which suggests a connection to algorithms for data streaming and sketching. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
