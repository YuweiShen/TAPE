The paper proposes new methods for explaining the informative components and important node features in the input data used by the GNN model. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
