This involves the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to analyze nonverbal cues such as body motion and eye gaze, as well as the development of a controller for a humanoid robot (cs.RO). The study also involves human participants and their perception of the robot's actions, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of machine learning techniques to build the computational model and validate its performance also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
