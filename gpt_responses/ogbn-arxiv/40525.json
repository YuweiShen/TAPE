This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including: \n\n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category deals with audio and speech processing, which is directly relevant to the paper's focus on speech enhancement. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing, which is also relevant to the paper's use of a language model to enhance speech. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with machine learning techniques, which are used in the paper to learn the acoustic noisy-clean speech mapping function. \n- cs.SI (Speech and Signal Processing): This sub-category deals with speech and signal processing, which is directly relevant to the paper's focus on speech enhancement. \n\nOverall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SD and cs.CL, followed by cs.LG and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
