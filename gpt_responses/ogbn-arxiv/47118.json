This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of algorithms to find plans and associated disclosure policies suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the fact that the paper deals with a worst-case model and formulates the disclosure policy as a map on edge labels suggests that it may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
