The paper also discusses the expressive power and efficient algorithms for world-set decompositions, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions decision problems and algorithms, which are related to computer science theory (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
