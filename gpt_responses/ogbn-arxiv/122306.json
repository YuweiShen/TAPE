It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the proposed method involves adding noise to the gradients to improve performance. Additionally, it may be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as deep learning models are commonly used in computer vision tasks. It could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the proposed method involves modifying the optimization algorithm for neural networks. Finally, it may be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it involves optimizing the batch-size in stochastic optimization algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
