It also discusses the use of universal priors and loss functions, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions convergence of posteriors and losses, which is a topic in statistics and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with computability and convergence, which are topics in theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
