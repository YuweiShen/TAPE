The paper also uses stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization algorithm in machine learning (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper analyzes the algorithm using the Fokker-Planck formalism, which is a common tool in control theory and stochastic systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
