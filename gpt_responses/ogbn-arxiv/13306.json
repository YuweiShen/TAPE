This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses optimization of the pooling function alongside the features in a single global objective function, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of a Gaussian function for pooling, which is a common technique in neural networks and may suggest that the paper belongs to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of heuristics in existing pooling schemes, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents experiments on MNIST digits, which suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
