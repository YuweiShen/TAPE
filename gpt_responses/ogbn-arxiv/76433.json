This is a problem that is commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper proposes a new approach that involves jointly optimizing low rank matrix completion and integrability constraints, which is a technique that is commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on real and synthetic datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
