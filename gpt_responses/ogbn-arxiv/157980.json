The paper also discusses the challenges of training on small datasets, which is a problem that is often addressed using machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and regularization, making cs.LG and cs.AI likely categories as well. The paper also mentions two specific image-based tasks - image quality estimation and image tampering detection - which fall under the categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
