This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this task suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of UDPipe 1.2 baseline for sentence segmentation, tokenization, and dependency parsing, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
