As such, it is most likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. However, the paper also discusses the concept of human-centered transparency and the use of psychophysics to optimize teleoperation control, which suggests that it could also fit into the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of motor control and perceptual assessment, which could potentially place it in the Machine Learning (cs.MA) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
