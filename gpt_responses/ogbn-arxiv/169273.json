This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses fairness in resource allocation, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to scheduling problems in cellular base-stations and queueing systems, which are examples of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
