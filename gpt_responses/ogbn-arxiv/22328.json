The paper also deals with networks and their modeling, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of embeddings and their distributed representation suggests the possibility of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) being a likely category. Finally, the paper deals with large datasets and efficient training strategies, which could also fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
