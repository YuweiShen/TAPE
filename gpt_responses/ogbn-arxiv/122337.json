Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel approach to regress 3DMM parameters, which involves training a CNN end-to-end. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. Additionally, the paper incorporates multiview geometric constraints into the network, which could place it in the cs.GR (Graphics) category. The paper also mentions the use of a differentiable dense optical flow estimator, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper deals with 3D shape recovery, which could place it in the cs.RO (Robotics) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
