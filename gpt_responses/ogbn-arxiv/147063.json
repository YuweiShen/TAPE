The paper also discusses the use of preambles for channel estimation, which is a common technique in wireless communication and falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of optimal design techniques, which is a topic related to optimization and numerical analysis (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses simulation results, which may involve statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
