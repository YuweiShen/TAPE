The paper also mentions applications in community detection and clustering, which are topics in social network analysis (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The construction of a Succinct Clique Tree (SCT) involves compressing the representation of all cliques in an input graph, which is related to data compression (cs.CE). Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of getting local per-vertex and per-edge $k$-clique counts, which is a problem in social network analysis (cs.SI) and statistical analysis (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
