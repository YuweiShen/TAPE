Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these are the most relevant subfields for this topic. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of experience replay buffer and learning update steps, which are related to optimization and control, respectively, making cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. Finally, the VizDoom environment used in the experiments involves graphics rendering, which could also make cs.GR (Graphics) a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
