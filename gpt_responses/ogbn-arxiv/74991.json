This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Databases (cs.DB) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents a generic approach to parallelising data sketches efficiently, which suggests that it may also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the error introduced by parallelism and utilises relaxed semantics and the notion of strong linearisability to prove correctness, which suggests that it may belong to the Probability (cs.PF) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
