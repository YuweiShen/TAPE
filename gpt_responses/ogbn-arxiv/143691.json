The paper focuses on the use of optimization algorithms to efficiently compute control policies, which suggests that it may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel smooth and differentiable quantitative semantics for STL, which could be of interest to researchers in the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SY and cs.RO, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
