This topic falls under the scope of several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). However, given the focus on fraud detection and the use of machine learning techniques, cs.CR and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of dealing with complex financial data, which suggests a potential overlap with cs.DB and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
