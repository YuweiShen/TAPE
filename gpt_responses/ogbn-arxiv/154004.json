This involves the use of high-performance computing infrastructures such as clusters of GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). \n\nThe paper also focuses on deep learning frameworks and neural nets, which are related to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nThe experiments conducted in the paper involve the use of ImageNet and CIFAR datasets, which are related to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed designs into the KVStore API of the MXNET, which is related to the sub-category cs.Distributed and Parallel Computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
