The paper proposes a new approach that exploits nested nonprehensile actions to solve the problem of rearrangement. The paper also revisits several existing rearrangement planning techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves reasoning about object interactions, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also involves experiments with a real Kuka robotic arm, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
