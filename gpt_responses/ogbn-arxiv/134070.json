The use of constant envelope (CE) signals emitted from each antenna is a technique that aims to improve energy efficiency, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). The paper also analyzes the distortions introduced by low-resolution quantization to PSK, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT and cs.COMM, followed by cs.SI, cs.NI, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
