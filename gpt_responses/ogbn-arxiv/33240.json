The use of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) and Markov decision processes (MDP) suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The optimization aspect of the problem may also make it relevant to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of entropy as a cost function suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
