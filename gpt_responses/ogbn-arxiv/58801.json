The use of DeCNNs to reconstruct input images is also a common technique in computer vision and image processing. The paper also discusses the impact of changing the number and shape of feature maps, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the intrinsic symmetry and invertible structure of the CNN-DeCNN architecture, which relates to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
