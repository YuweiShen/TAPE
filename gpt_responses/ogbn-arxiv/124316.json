The paper also discusses control laws for navigating under kinodynamic constraints, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper uses mathematical formalization and graph theory to encode priorities and homotopy classes, which are topics in mathematics (cs.MA). The paper also discusses unexpected events and the need for robustness, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of homotopy classes to deviate from pre-planned trajectories, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
