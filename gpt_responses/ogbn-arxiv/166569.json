The paper also discusses the security of deep convolutional neural network models, which is related to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper proposes an attack on the MTCNN detector, which involves generating adversarial examples, and hence, it is related to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with real-world scenarios and the use of printed face attributes, which is related to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
