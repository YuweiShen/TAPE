The paper also discusses the use of channel interleaving and bit-mapping, which are techniques commonly used in system-level design (cs.SY) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed design in different channel conditions, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
