The optimal strategy of each agent is derived and a recursive method to achieve the optimal strategy is provided. This falls under the scope of game theory. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper studies the decision process of an agent in a social network, where social learning and negative network externality play important roles. This falls under the scope of social and information networks. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the capability of agents to make decisions to maximize their utilities, which involves learning from other agents' experiences. This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n4. cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper studies the decision process of agents in a social network, which falls under the scope of computational social science. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the intelligent decision-making capabilities of agents in a social network, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
