The authors propose a redesigned RCNN model and training strategies, which involve machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.AI), reinforcement learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also deals with multimodal and multiclass detection, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
