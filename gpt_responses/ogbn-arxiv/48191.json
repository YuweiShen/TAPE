The use of tensor factorisation and complex domain analysis suggests that the paper may fall under the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the development of a new algorithm for EEG connectivity estimation, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential clinical applications of the proposed method, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
