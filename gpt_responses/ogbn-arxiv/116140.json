Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the exploration of resolution-refutation properties, which is a topic in mathematical logic, making cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) another likely sub-category. The algorithm's efficiency and scalability suggest that it may involve data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category. The paper also deals with propositional logic, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper's focus on formal verification suggests that it may also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
