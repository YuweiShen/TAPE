The use of an augmented stylus also involves robotics (cs.RO) and signal processing (cs.SD) to generate realistic tactile and sound feedback. The paper also discusses the effects of superposition and fluctuation of frequencies on human perception, which relates to the field of signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper evaluates users' perception and preference of each feedback type, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
