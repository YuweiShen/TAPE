The proposed algorithms are based on convex optimization, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the application of the algorithms to noisy measurements, which falls under the category of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
