The use of convex programs and LP solvers suggests that the paper may belong to cs.GT (Game Theory) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The mention of \"small\" coefficients and strongly polynomial time algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of flexible budget markets as a key concept suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
