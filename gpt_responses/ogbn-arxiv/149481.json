The use of simulation and training of a deep learning agent also suggests the possibility of computer vision (cs.CV) being involved. Additionally, the paper deals with the challenges of uncertainty and safety in a dynamic traffic environment, which could also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
