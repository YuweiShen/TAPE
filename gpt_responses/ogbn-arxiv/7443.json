The paper also introduces a new type of degree constraint based on matroids, which is related to graph theory (cs.GT). The paper uses iterative rounding/relaxation algorithms, which are commonly used in optimization problems and fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves numerical analysis and optimization techniques, which fall under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithmic approach to solve the problem, which falls under the category of computational complexity and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
