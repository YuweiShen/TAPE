The proposed method involves using a fully convolutional neural network to estimate multiple grasp poses from a single RGB image, which requires computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The use of multiple hypothesis prediction model also involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the real-time robotic applications require control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
