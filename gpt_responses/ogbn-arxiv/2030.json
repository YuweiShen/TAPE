The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques such as visual inertial odometry and Extended Kalman Filter (cs.CV). The proposed system also involves cloud computing and data fusion, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the system aims to enable autonomous navigation in real-world environments, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
