This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of deep learning models and attention networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories.
