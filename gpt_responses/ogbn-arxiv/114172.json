This involves the use of information theory concepts such as channel capacity and mutual information. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of OFDM in communication systems operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band to achieve multi-Gbps transmissions. This is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a power allocation (PA) scheme that seeks to minimize the average symbol error rate. This involves the design of a control system to optimize the performance of the OFDM system. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of low-resolution ADCs to ensure an acceptable level of power consumption and system costs in mmWave systems. This is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of OFDM in communication systems to combat frequency-selective fading and achieve multi-Gbps transmissions. This is a key area of research in multimedia systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
