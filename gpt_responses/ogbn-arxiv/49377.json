The use of Private Stream Aggregation schemes involves the aggregation of data in a network, which can be seen as a problem in distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of key-homomorphic functions, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The comparison of different perturbation mechanisms involves statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.LG).
