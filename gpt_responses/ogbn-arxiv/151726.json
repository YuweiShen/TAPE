Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a boosting algorithm to solve the optimization problem, which could fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the pedestrian detector is designed to work in real-world scenarios, which could be related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
