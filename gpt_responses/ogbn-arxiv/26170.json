The system is designed to help domain experts with their training tasks in a practical environment, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HCI). The paper also mentions the use of a novel cube-style visualization to reveal complex correlations among multiple types of heterogeneous training data, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
