This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless cooperative communications, which is a key area in networking and internet architecture. The proposed LAURA framework involves relay selection, which is a fundamental problem in wireless networks.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses physical layer security in the presence of untrusted relays, which is a key problem in cryptography and security. The proposed LAURA framework aims to provide security against interception by untrusted relays.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless communications, which is a key area in multimedia. The proposed LAURA framework aims to provide reliable and secure transmission of multimedia content.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a framework for link adaptation and relay assignment, which involves power and rate allocation to achieve reliability and security.
