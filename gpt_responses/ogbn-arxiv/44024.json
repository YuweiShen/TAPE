The paper also discusses the use of Hessian-free optimization for training deep MDRNNs, which falls under the category of neural networks and machine learning (NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE. However, since the paper also discusses the use of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as an objective for learning MDRNNs, it could also belong to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (CL) and machine learning (LG). Additionally, since the paper discusses the use of MDRNNs for speech and handwriting recognition, it could also belong to the sub-categories of computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
