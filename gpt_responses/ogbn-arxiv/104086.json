The paper also discusses the impact of CSI feedback delay and channel dynamics on MU-MIMO performance, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a new scheme for MU-MIMO that is based on scheduling, which is a common technique in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.COM). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
