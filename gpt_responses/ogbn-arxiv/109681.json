The use of SAT solvers and XOR-SAT filters suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and constraint satisfaction problems (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the information-theoretic limit, which is a concept in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the focus on storage efficiency and algorithmic performance suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
