The paper presents an empirical comparison among several compressed representations for binary relations, analyzing their space usage and the speed of their operations using different (synthetic and real) data distributions. The paper includes both neighborhood and set operations, proposing algorithms for set operations for the BRWT, which were not presented before in the literature. The paper also includes a scalability study of the data representations. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DB (Databases), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
