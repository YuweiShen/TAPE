The paper discusses the development of automatic question-answering systems and the need for automatic evaluation of chatbots. The proposed models use hierarchical structures and attention mechanisms to learn dialogue representations. The paper also introduces new evaluation measures for the Dialogue Quality and Nugget Detection subtasks. Based on this information, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and software development (SD) aspects, which make cs.IR and cs.SD possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
