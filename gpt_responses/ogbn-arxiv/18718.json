This involves analyzing the local phase information of images and proposing a new objective index called the feature similarity index for tone-mapped images (FSITM). This work is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image processing and analysis. It also involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with HDR images and their tone mapping. The paper also involves graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with the visualization of images. Information theory (cs.IT) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are also relevant as the paper proposes a new objective index for evaluating TMOs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
