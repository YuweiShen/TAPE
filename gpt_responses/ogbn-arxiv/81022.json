The use of optimization algorithms and approximation techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The paper also discusses utility maximization, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT) and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
