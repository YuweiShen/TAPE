The paper discusses the use of hybrid beamforming and low-resolution ADCs to reduce power consumption, which is a common problem in wireless communication systems. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on millimeter wave communication systems, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
