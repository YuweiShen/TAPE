The paper also heavily relies on linear algebra and category theory, which are covered under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IT (Information Theory), respectively. The use of Frobenius algebras to model classical data in quantum protocols suggests a possible connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), while the use of strongly monoidal functors to formalize topological quantum field theories suggests a possible connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
