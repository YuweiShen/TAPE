The paper also discusses a novel neural network training approach for continuous or high-dimensional data, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions the multivariate alternating conditional expectation (MACE) algorithm for computing the proposed functional representations for discrete data, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
