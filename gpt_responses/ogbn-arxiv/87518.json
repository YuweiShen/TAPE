The paper also discusses the issue of multipath interference, which is related to the physical setup of the camera and its interaction with the environment, making it relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper reports results on both simulated and physical experiments, which suggests that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
