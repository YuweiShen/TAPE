The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint clustering and representation learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions mini-batch k-means, which is a common clustering algorithm in multimedia (cs.MM). The feature drift compensation scheme proposed in the paper is related to domain adaptation, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing techniques such as stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization algorithm in computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
