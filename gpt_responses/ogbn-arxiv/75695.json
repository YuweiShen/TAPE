The techniques used in the paper involve data structures and graph theory, which are typical topics in the cs.DS and cs.CG sub-categories. The paper also involves combinatorial optimization, which is a topic in the cs.DM sub-category. The paper's focus on finding maximum flow involves linear programming, which is a topic in the cs.GT sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of numerical methods to solve linear programs suggests that it could also be relevant to the cs.NA sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
