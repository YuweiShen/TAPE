Additionally, the paper addresses linguistic quality aspects that are only indirectly captured by content-based approaches to summary evaluation, which is a common problem in NLP. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. \n\nFurthermore, the paper deals with information retrieval and text generation, which are relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a model that can be used for system development, which is relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
