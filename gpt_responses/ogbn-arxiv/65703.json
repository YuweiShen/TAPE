The approach combines geometric matrix completion models with conditional random fields (CRFs) and uses a deep model to predict missing entries by solving the MAP inference problem. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures (cs.DS), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
