The authors use access logs to study the connection speeds, data usage caps, and user behavior across different providers. This makes cs.NI the most likely category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with a TV streaming service and its usage patterns, which falls under the domain of multimedia. The authors also analyze the impact of external events on live TV usage, which further strengthens the case for cs.MM.\n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The authors use access logs to study user behavior and usage patterns, which can be seen as a form of social network analysis. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential of product bundle discounts to capture a bigger share of accesses, which can be seen as a strategy to leverage social networks.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the impact of data usage caps imposed by mobile ISPs on user behavior and usage patterns. This can be seen as a societal issue, as it affects the accessibility and affordability of a popular TV streaming service.\n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not explicitly deal with security or cryptography, but it does discuss the potential of spec"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
