The paper also discusses the trade-off between resource usage and accuracy, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed architecture blocks, depthwise dense block and depthwise feature-pyramid-network, involve neural network design and optimization, which could also fall under neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on three benchmarks, which could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
