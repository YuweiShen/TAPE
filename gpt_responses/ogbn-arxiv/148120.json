Additionally, the proposed Instance Relation Network (IRNet) utilizes deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms for feature extraction and classification, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of sparsity constraints in the Duplicate Removal Module suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper involves the analysis of a large dataset, which may suggest that it belongs to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of instance relation interaction in the proposed method may suggest that the paper belongs to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
