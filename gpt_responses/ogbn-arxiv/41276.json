The paper also mentions the use of expensive techniques for recognizing words in a holistic way, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithm specifically designed for text, which relates to natural language processing (cs.CL). The comparison of different methods and the use of experiments suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
