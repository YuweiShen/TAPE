Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new algorithm that involves optimization and machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves numerical methods for solving ODEs, which makes cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves optimization techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category.
