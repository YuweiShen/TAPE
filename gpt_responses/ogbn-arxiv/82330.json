The proposed method involves exploiting the structured sparsity of multiple SM signals, which is a technique commonly used in compressive sensing (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a subspace pursuit algorithm for signal detection, which is a technique used in sparse signal processing (cs.SI). The paper deals with improving the performance of SM-MIMO systems, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity signal detector, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
