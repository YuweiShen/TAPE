The convergence property of the schemes is also discussed, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also presents a new discrete scheme, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the comparison of asymptotic errors involves statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
