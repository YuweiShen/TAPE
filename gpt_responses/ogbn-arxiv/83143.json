The use of valued constraints and algebraic properties of functions suggests a connection to the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The mention of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the abstract suggests that the paper may be relevant to these subfields as well. The identification of a novel class of submodular functions that can be expressed by binary submodular functions suggests a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the refutation of a conjecture on the structure of the extreme rays of the cone of Boolean submodular functions suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
