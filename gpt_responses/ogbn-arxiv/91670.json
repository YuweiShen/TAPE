This topic is closely related to computer security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on deep neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper proposes a general framework for embedding watermarks in model parameters, which could also be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data privacy (cs.CY) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
