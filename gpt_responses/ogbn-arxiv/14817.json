The paper also considers secrecy in wireless communication, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper involves multiple receivers and transmitters, which suggests the use of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also deals with beamforming, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves numerical simulations, which suggests the use of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
