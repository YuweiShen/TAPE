The proposed method involves fine-tuning pre-trained Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and using them as base classifiers, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Additionally, the conversion of telecom datasets into 2D images and the use of Deep CNNs with high learning capacity on images suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV). Finally, the use of ensemble-based meta-classification techniques such as Genetic Programming and AdaBoost suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
