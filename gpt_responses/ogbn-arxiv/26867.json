Electromagnetic energy harvesting is a common method used in IoT devices, making this sub-category a likely fit.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper emphasizes the role of software in optimizing energy consumption of IoT systems. This involves control of hardware, making cs.SY a relevant sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the need for energy transparency in software development, which is a software engineering concern.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the interaction between software and hardware in optimizing energy consumption, which is a topic that falls under hardware architecture.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses deeply embedded systems that operate on limited sources of energy, which is a characteristic of embedded systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
