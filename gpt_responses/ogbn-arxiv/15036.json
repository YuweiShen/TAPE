Additionally, the use of Active Contour Models (ACM) and geometric properties of buildings suggest that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The end-to-end training approach and incorporation of priors and constraints also suggest that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of structured output models and evaluation on challenging datasets suggest that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
