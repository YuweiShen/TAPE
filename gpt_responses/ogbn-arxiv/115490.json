The paper proposes a new algorithm for matrix completion that estimates leverage scores and then uses them to resample the matrix nonuniformly. This algorithm is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), information theory (cs.IT), data structures (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
