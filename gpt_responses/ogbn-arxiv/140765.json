This falls under the domain of embedded systems, which is concerned with the design and implementation of computer systems that are integrated into physical devices.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on measuring the energy consumption of wireless IoT devices, which requires understanding the communication protocols and network architectures used by these devices. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture, which is concerned with the design and analysis of communication systems and protocols.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a calibration technique for the power measurement platform, which involves modeling and analyzing the behavior of the system under different settings. This falls under the domain of systems and control, which is concerned with the modeling, analysis, and optimization of complex systems.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the effect of various design parameters on the performance of the power measurement platform, which involves optimizing the hardware architecture for low-power and high-accuracy operation. This falls under the domain of hardware architecture, which is concerned with the design and implementation of computer systems at the level of circuits and components.\n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The paper focuses on the emerging field of IoT, which involves the integration"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
