This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image classification and processing, which is a key aspect of multimedia.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper uses sensor pattern noise (SPN) to distinguish between computer-generated graphics and natural images. SPN is a technique used in digital forensics and can be related to cryptography and security.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses deep learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to classify images.\n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with computer-generated graphics and their distinction from natural images, which falls under the domain of computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
