This is a core topic in computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video copy-move detection, which is a multimedia-related problem. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a method for detecting and localizing video copy-move forgeries, which is relevant to information retrieval tasks such as detecting fake news or identifying manipulated images and videos. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with detecting and localizing video copy-move forgeries, which is a security-related problem. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it is possible that some of the techniques used in the proposed algorithm are based on machine learning methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
