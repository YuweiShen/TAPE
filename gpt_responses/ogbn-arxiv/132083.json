Additionally, the use of ontologies to answer queries from students and lecturers suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the application of the method to lecture notes suggests a potential application in software engineering (cs.SE) for educational purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
