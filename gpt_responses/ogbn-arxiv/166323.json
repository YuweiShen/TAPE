The paper also proposes algorithms for group election, which is a variant of leader election, and uses it to implement TAS objects, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses adversary models and complexity analysis, which are common topics in distributed computing and algorithms research. Therefore, cs.DC and cs.DS are the most likely categories. The paper also involves some topics related to logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL), such as describing the modification to a TAS algorithm and proving the existence of a schedule determined by an oblivious adversary."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
