Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and complexity analysis, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as likely sub-categories. The connection between separability and partitions suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as a possible sub-category.
