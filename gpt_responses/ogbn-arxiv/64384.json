The use of deep learning and LSTM models also suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The experiments involve classification of attention state and emotional sentiment, which could potentially fall under computer vision (cs.CV) as well as human-computer interaction (cs.HC) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
