The paper also discusses the practicality and composability of secure neighbor discovery protocols, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes and analyzes specific secure neighbor discovery protocols, which could be of interest to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
