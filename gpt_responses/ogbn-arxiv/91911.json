The paper discusses the development of a semantic inventory for adpositions and case markers in English, which involves natural language processing techniques that are often associated with machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions an automatic disambiguation task, which could fall under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of corpus data, which could be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the consideration of adposition and case phenomena in multiple languages, which could be relevant to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE) if these languages were used to train or test neural models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
