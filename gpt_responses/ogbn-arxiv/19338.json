This involves generating test goals, modifying them to examine unintended game transitions, and extracting test goals from human tester trajectories. The paper also discusses the use of interaction states to model human tester interactions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SE (Software Engineering), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.GT (Game Theory). The paper also touches upon human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and systems and control (cs.SY) in terms of the proposed methodology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
