This involves the use of caches in small-cell base stations to reduce the overall backhaul load. The paper derives necessary conditions for secrecy and achievable backhaul rate for two models of eavesdropping attacks. It formulates the optimal caching schemes with secrecy constraints as a convex optimization problem and investigates the backhaul rate performance of the heterogeneous network with secrecy constraints using numerical simulations. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of secrecy constraints, which is a key topic in information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the use of caches in small-cell base stations to reduce the overall backhaul load, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with the problem of eavesdropping attacks and derives necessary conditions for secrecy, which are topics in cryptography and security. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper formulates the optimal caching schemes as a convex optimization problem, which is a topic in distributed computing. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper investigates the impact of system parameters such as file popularity and capabilities of small-cell base stations on"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
