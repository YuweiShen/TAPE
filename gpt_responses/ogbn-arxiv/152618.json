The use of higher-order types and the characterisation of the hierarchy NP $\\subseteq$ NEXP $\\subseteq$ NEXP$^{(2)}$ $\\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq$ NEXP$^{(k)}$ $\\subseteq \\cdots$ also suggest that the paper may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The use of cons-free programs and immutable functions is a technique used in functional programming, which may suggest that the paper could also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper may also be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category, as it deals with the complexity of functional programs. Additionally, the use of higher-typed, purely functional programs may suggest that the paper could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on characterising the hierarchy of non-deterministic programs may suggest that it could also belong to the Theory of Computation (cs.THEORY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
