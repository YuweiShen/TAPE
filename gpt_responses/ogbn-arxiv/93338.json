It also involves cryptography and security (cs.CR) as smart contracts are executed on a blockchain. The paper evaluates and compares different formalisms, which requires statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a new formalism for modelling smart contract semantics, which falls under the category of computational economics (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
