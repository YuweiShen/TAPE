The proposed method involves merging multiple pre-trained models, which falls under the category of transfer learning and multi-task learning (cs.AI). The use of layer-wise neuron sharing and weight updating also suggests a potential application in neural architecture search (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve image datasets such as ImageNet and CelebA, indicating a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
