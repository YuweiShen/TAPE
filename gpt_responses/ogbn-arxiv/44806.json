The paper also discusses the use of latent conditional random fields (L-CRFs) for modeling the dynamics of facial expressions and AUs, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of considering the variability in latent states for modeling facial expressions and AUs, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
