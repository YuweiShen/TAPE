Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of recurrent neural networks also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV), although these are less likely given the focus on NLP tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
