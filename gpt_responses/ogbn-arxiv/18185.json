These techniques are commonly used in the fields of Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Multimedia (cs.MM), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computer Communications (cs.COM). Given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories. However, the paper also discusses the use of ABF and beamforming, which are more commonly associated with cs.SY and cs.COM. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.MM, cs.SY, and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
