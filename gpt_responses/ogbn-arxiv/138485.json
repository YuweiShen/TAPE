The use of formal language theory and graph structures for planning and filtering suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and planning (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the impact of degradations in a robot's sensor and actuation suites, which relates to system modeling and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's focus on algorithms and operations suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
