It also talks about the extension of blockchain from a linear to a non-linear structure for performance improvements, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the trade-off between scalability and finality-duration, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper establishes a formal framework and proves certain results, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
