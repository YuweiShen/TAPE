This method is based on encoding the language semantics and the two programs as terms. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the formalization of read-sets and write-sets of symbolic expressions and statements, which suggests that it could also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the verification of program schemas and compiler optimizations, which could place it in the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
