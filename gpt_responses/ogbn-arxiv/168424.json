The paper discusses methods of constructing codes and obtaining bounds on minimum distances, which are typical topics in information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions a problem about binomials over finite fields, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper's focus on constructing codes with better parameters suggests that it may be relevant to computer science (cs.CC) and possibly also to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
