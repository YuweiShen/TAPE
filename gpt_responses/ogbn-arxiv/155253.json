The technique involves enforcing directional path consistency, which is related to graph algorithms and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the technique, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
