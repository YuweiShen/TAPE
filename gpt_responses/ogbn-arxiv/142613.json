It is implemented in a typical Wasserstein auto-encoder framework and uses a mixture of Gaussians as a target distribution in latent space. The paper discusses the use of a Gaussian classifier induced by the target distribution and the optimization of the model using Cramer-Wold distance as a maximum mean discrepancy penalty. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computation and language (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
