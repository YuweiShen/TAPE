Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are likely categories. The paper also proposes a new filtering technique based on bitmaps and bitwise operations, which are common in data structures and algorithms. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are also possible categories. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed technique on CPU and GPU architectures, which is related to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
