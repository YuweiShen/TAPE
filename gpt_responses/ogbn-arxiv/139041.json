The use of non-circular sources is a specific aspect of the problem, which suggests the cs.SI (Signal Processing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance analysis of the proposed algorithms, which involves statistical considerations and asymptotic results, indicating the cs.ST (Statistics Theory) sub-category. The use of antenna arrays and the estimation of parameters from signals suggest the cs.SP (Signal Processing) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of mean squared error (MSE) expressions, which is a common metric in machine learning, suggesting the cs.MM (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the estimation of parameters from noisy signals, which is a common problem in information theory, suggesting the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
