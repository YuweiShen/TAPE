It is applicable to any existing model training setting that provides a loss measure for samples and a way to refit on new ones. The paper demonstrates the success of the proposed approach in improving the accuracy of deep image classifiers and the quality of samples generated by DC-GAN models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
