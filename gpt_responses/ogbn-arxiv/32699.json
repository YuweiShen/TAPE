The use of embedded security aspects for detecting fake currencies also involves cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The involvement of real forensic samples in the experiment suggests the use of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. The comparison with human subjects and the applicability for mass checking of currency notes suggests the use of machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
