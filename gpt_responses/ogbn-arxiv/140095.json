The paper also proposes a new accuracy measure for assessing the performance of these systems, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) and computational engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper discusses the preferences and needs of clinicians, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper mentions experimentation and computation, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
