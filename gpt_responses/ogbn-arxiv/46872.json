Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of deploying data processing frameworks in large-scale clusters and multi-tenant Cloud infrastructures, which could also place it in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The use of reactive dataflow programming and Lua scripting language could suggest a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SE (Software Engineering), respectively. Finally, the paper also discusses the experimental results of the proposed framework, which could place it in the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
