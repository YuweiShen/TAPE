The use of compressive sensing techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of sparse signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with MIMO systems, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of multiple antenna systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
