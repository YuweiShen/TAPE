This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of local minimum mean square error (L-MMSE) combining, which is a signal processing technique, and hence, the paper could also be classified under signal processing (cs.SI). The use of massive MIMO also makes it relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.MM) as it involves the use of multiple antennas to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Finally, the proposed algorithm involves optimization techniques, which could be classified under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
