Additionally, the paper proposes a solution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which falls under the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also formulates the problem as a parameterized action Markov decision process (PAMDP), which falls under the sub-category of Control Systems (cs.SY).
