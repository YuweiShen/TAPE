It uses a declarative language, such as SQL, to enumerate hypotheses that probe the structure of an unknown probabilistic graphical causal model of the underlying system. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper emphasizes the use of databases to enable users to rapidly explore the possible causal mechanisms in data collected from diverse sources.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an unsupervised root-cause analysis engine that uses time series monitoring data to identify causal dependencies and rank hypotheses.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with large complex systems such as data centres, which can be seen as information networks.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses how the engine has helped resolve over 30 performance issues in a commercial product since late 2014, which suggests a software engineering context.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of probabilistic graphical causal models, which are a common tool in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
