The paper focuses on the design and analysis of the modulation scheme, including the optimal maximum likelihood detector and a low-complexity suboptimal detector. Theoretical derivations of channel capacity and bit error rate are presented in various channel scenarios, and performance bounding is also provided. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.IT (Information Theory)\n- cs.COMM (Communication and Networking)\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control)\n- cs.MM (Multimedia)\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
