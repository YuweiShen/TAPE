The paper discusses the fusion of different views into one graph and the learning of explicit cluster structure. These topics are related to machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.SI, and cs.CL. Among these sub-categories, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely ones as the paper focuses on developing a clustering algorithm for multi-view data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
