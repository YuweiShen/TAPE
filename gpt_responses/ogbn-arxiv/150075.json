This involves combining variational auto-encoders with locally-optimal controllers and introducing specific structures in the generative graphical model to robustly linearize the model dynamics. The paper also proposes a principled variational approximation of the embedding posterior that takes the future observation into account, making the variational approximation more robust against noise. Based on these contributions, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper involves experiments with image data, which suggests a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's focus on optimal control suggests a possible connection to cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
