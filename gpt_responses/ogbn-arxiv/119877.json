The use of hypergraph-theoretic methods suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of computer science dealing with discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorial optimization (cs.CG). Finally, the mention of \"ordering\" in the title suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of computer science dealing with data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
