The paper also discusses the transformation of the input sequence in terms of runs, which is a concept commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The difficulty of synchronizing the channel output sequence to the transmitted codeword is a problem that arises in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a mutual information decomposition, which is a technique used in machine learning and information theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
