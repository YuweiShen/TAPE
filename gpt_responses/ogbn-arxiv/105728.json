The algorithm leverages modern program synthesis techniques, which are also studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and computer architecture (cs.AR) communities. Finally, the paper applies the approach to traces from a variety of sources, including virtual platforms and real-time systems, which suggests a potential application in the systems (cs.SY) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
