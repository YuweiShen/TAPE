The concept of information-symbol locality is motivated by applications to distributed storage, which falls under the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also discusses the minimum distance of codes, which is a topic in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (cs.DC) sub-category. The local error-correction property is related to error-correcting codes, which are studied in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions concatenated codes, which are a type of error-correcting code and are studied in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
