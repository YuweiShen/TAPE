The paper also involves designing a mechanism to elicit true noise rates from strategic annotators, which falls under the category of mechanism design (cs.GT). The use of auction theory and Myerson's optimal auction design framework suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the problem of learning from noisy labeled examples is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
