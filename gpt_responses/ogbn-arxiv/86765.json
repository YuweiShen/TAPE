The paper proposes a novel deep learning framework for joint activity recognition and indoor localization using WiFi channel state information (CSI) fingerprints. Therefore, it is likely to also belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), control systems (cs.SY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) due to the use of deep learning and the potential applications in surveillance and location-based services."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
