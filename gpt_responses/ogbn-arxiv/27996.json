The use of massive MIMO technology also suggests a potential fit with multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the proposed algorithm for acquiring reliable CSIT involves compressive sampling, which could be relevant to computer science and information retrieval (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
