The use of stochastic geometry models and performance evaluation also suggests the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), which are a type of wireless communication technology, indicating the Mobile Computing (cs.MA) sub-category.
