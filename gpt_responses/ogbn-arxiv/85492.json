The use of distances and the mention of computational complexity suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of consensus and approximation may also make the paper relevant to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
