This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The study proposes a new class of arbitrary input generalized erasure channels, which can be approximated by other same channel models. This can be relevant in the context of social and information networks.\n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the efficient construction of polar codes for a binary erasure channel using its useful property. This can be related to computational complexity.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The recursive formulas of the polar transformation of the proposed channel can be seen as a data structure or algorithmic problem.\n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The evaluation of the polar transformation using the \u03b1-mutual information can be relevant in the context of networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
