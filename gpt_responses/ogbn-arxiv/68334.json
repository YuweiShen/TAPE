The construction is based on solutions of $k$-restriction problems, which are well-known in coding theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses deep results from coding theory to provide explicit, deterministic algorithms, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.DS (data structures) and cs.DM (discrete mathematics). Finally, the paper involves numerical optimization to find the optimal point set, which may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.NA (numerical analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
