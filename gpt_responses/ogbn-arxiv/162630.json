The paper specifically focuses on the effectiveness of different text representation mechanisms, including word embeddings, for active learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are covered by sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning). \n\nFinally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) tasks such as document classification, which is covered by the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
