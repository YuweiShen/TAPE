The use of sensor nodes to collect information about the wireless environment suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the development of a deep reinforcement learning-based method for power control indicates a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
