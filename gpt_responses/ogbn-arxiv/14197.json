Therefore, cs.AI and cs.MA are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of function approximation and distributed optimization, which are topics in machine learning (ML) and optimization (RO), respectively. Additionally, the paper deals with coordination and control in multi-agent systems, which are topics in systems and control (SY).
