The introduction of new tractable subproblems of the CSP can be useful in solving real-world problems efficiently. \n2. cs.DS: The paper introduces the notion of topological minors of a binary CSP instance, which is a concept from graph theory. The paper also discusses the use of forbidden patterns to define tractable subproblems, which is a common technique in algorithm design and analysis. \n3. cs.CC: The paper discusses the complexity of the CSP and introduces new tractable subproblems. This is a central topic in computational complexity theory. \n4. cs.LG: The paper discusses the use of forbidden patterns to define tractable subproblems, which is a common technique in machine learning. The paper also introduces the notion of topological minors, which is a concept from graph theory that is relevant to many machine learning applications. \n5. cs.DM: The paper introduces the notion of topological minors of a binary CSP instance, which is a concept from graph theory.
