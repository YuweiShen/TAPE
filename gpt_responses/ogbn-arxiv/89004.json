The paper proposes neural network models for implicit discourse relation classification, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The models are based on feedforward and long-short term memory architecture, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves tuning of hyperparameters, which is a common task in neural network optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with cross-linguistic discourse parsing, which involves information retrieval and information extraction (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
