The paper proposes a new dataset for drone-based geo-localization, which involves machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The paper also analyzes off-the-shelf CNN features, which is a common technique in CV. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of navigation, which is related to graphics (GR) and robotics (RO) fields.
