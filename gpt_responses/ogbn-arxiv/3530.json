The use of constraints to represent partially known or unknown property values is related to database systems (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The development of a semantics for this extension of RDF and the study of SPARQL query evaluation is related to logic and knowledge representation (cs.LG), software engineering (cs.SE), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
