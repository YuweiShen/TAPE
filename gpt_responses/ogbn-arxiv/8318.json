The paper also discusses optimization of the sensor design, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of optical time-of-flight range measurement modules and optimization of the elastomer-air boundary could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper provides hardware design files and software sources, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
