This topic falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization and control (cs.OH). The paper also introduces new proof techniques for the alternating direction method (ADM) in the batch setting, which could be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of ADM in online learning scenarios could also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
