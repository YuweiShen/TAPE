The paper also discusses the error probability and the gap to capacity, which are important topics in coding theory (cs.CC). The trade-off between the gap to capacity and the error probability can be seen as a problem in optimization or control theory (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the Bhattacharyya parameter, which is a concept in probability theory and statistics (cs.DS). Finally, the discussion of error floors and their absence in polar codes relates to the design and analysis of communication networks (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
