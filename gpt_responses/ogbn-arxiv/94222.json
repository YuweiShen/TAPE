Additionally, the paper involves the use of analytical tools to model the decoding process, which could fall under the category of network information theory (cs.NI) or distributed systems (cs.DS). The analysis also involves the derivation of the distribution of the number of inactivations, which could be related to statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the proposed analysis could lead to the design of optimized LT codes, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
