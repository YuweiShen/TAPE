The paper focuses on deep learning models and their customization and combination for few-shot learning tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with natural language processing tasks, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
