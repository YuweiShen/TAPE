This suggests that the paper could belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Software Engineering (cs.SE) categories. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the modularity and extensibility of the language, which could also place it in the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) category. The paper also mentions the use of constraints and automatic parallelization, which could suggest Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
