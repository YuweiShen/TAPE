This involves aspects of multi-agent reinforcement learning (cs.MA), as well as deep reinforcement learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and systems and control (cs.SY). However, since the focus is primarily on the development of a new meta-learning framework, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
