The problem is formulated in a Bayesian filtering framework and exploits lanes, traffic signs, and vehicle dynamics to localize robustly with respect to a sparse semantic map. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
