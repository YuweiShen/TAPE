The use of kernel machines and the focus on learning context-aware similarity functions suggest a strong connection to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of deep networks and the regularization term suggest a possible connection to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
