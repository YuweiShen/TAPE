The paper also mentions mechanisms of feature extraction and connectivity between cells, which are topics related to neural networks (cs.NE). The proposed method of spectral clustering with anisotropic affinities is a machine learning technique (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the discussion of neural plausibility suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
