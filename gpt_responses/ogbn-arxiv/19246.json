Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of a low power embedded SOC, which suggests a focus on robotics and automation, leading to the possibility of cs.RO (Robotics) as a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks and optimization, indicating a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a ResNet10 like encoder, which is a type of neural network architecture, suggesting a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
