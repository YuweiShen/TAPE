Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks for state-to-action mapping in autonomous agents, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also proposes improvements to the neuroevolution process, which could be considered a contribution to the field of machine learning (cs.AI) and computational learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
