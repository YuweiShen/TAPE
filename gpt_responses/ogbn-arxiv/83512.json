This is a core topic in information theory. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a signal constellation for the separation-based compute-and-forward framework, which is a technique used in wireless networks. This could potentially fall under cs.SI. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a technique for wireless networks, which could fall under cs.NI. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of the channel coding, which could potentially fall under cs.CC. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not directly relate to multimedia, but the proposed lattice codes could potentially be used in multimedia applications such as video compression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
