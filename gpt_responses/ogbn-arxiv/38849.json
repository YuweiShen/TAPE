The problem involves computing the resilience of the system, which can be seen as a graph-theoretic problem (cs.DS, cs.DM). The paper also proposes algorithms to compute the resilience, which can be seen as a computational problem (cs.AL). Finally, the paper deals with synchronization and communication among robots, which can be seen as a problem in systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
