The paper also discusses the impact of noise regularisation on the behaviour of these models, which is a common technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification tasks, which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper also discusses the theoretical implications of noise regularisation on the covariance matrix of the NNGP, which relates to systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
