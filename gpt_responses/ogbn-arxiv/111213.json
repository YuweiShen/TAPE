The use of monomials in the code construction suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory (cs.CC). The study of weight hierarchy and minimum Hamming distance is related to the theory of error-correcting codes (cs.DS). The use of the Hasse derivative suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and its applications in coding theory (cs.SD). Finally, the study of simplifying expressions related to the weight hierarchy suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
