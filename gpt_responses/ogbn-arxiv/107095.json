It also proposes a new algorithm called XReg for efficient training and prediction. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it specifically focuses on Dynamic Search Advertising (DSA) and proposes a labelwise prediction algorithm for recommendation tasks. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as DSA involves processing and understanding user queries and matching them with relevant ads. \n\nComputer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category as XR can potentially be applied to image and video ranking tasks. \n\nFinally, the paper may be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it proposes a hierarchical decomposition of the XR task into smaller regression problems for efficient training and prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
