This topic falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions potential applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of spectral methods for polynomial approximations suggests a possible connection to scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
