Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the biological applications of the algorithm, indicating that it could be relevant to the sub-category cs.BIO (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics). The algorithm is designed to be low memory and scalable, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). The paper also mentions that the algorithm could enable novel biological analyses, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the algorithm involves statistical analysis, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
