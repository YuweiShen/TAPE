Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning alternatives, which suggests a possible fit for cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The evaluation protocol introduced in the paper also involves practical scenarios, which could potentially fall under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
