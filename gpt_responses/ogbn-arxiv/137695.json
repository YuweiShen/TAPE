The use of antenna selection diversity schemes also suggests a possible connection to control systems (cs.SY). The mention of multiuser scheduling gain and comparison with MIMO systems may indicate a focus on multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the estimation of ergodic capacity and comparison with upper and lower bounds suggests a possible connection to computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
