The paper also discusses convergence problems and overfitting, which are common issues in neural networks and optimization algorithms, respectively, and are relevant to the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also presents empirical results and discusses the use of polynomial models as an alternative to neural networks in various applications, which is relevant to the categories of data science (cs.DS) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
