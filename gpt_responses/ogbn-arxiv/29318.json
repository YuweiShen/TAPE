This is related to information theory concepts such as entropy and information content. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The use of Gaussian processes and kernel methods is also common in neural network and evolutionary computing research. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for system identification, which is a problem commonly encountered in artificial intelligence applications such as robotics and control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
