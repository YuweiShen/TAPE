The paper also involves optimization of algorithms for polynomial and matrix operations over finite fields, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). The use of polynomial root finding algorithms and matrix multiplication algorithms also relates to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
