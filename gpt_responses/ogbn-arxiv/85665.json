The paper also proposes an adaptive subcarrier grouping algorithm, which involves system design and control (cs.SY) and communication and networking (cs.COMM). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of channel correlation on system performance, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
