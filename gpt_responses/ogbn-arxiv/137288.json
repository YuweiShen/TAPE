As such, it is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, given that the focus of the paper is on NMT, we believe that cs.CL is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI. The other two sub-categories are less likely, but still possible given the use of neural networks in the proposed framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
