Additionally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of compressed models to adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper also explores the impact of compression on the transferability of adversarial samples, which is a topic that is relevant to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
