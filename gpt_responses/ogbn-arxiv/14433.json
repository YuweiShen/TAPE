The proposed method involves designing a module and a localizer, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions benchmark datasets, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) research.
