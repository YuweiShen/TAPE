The proposed algorithm is an extension of the SMOTE algorithm, which is a popular oversampling algorithm used in machine learning. The paper provides a theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm and presents experimental results on real-world datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
