The paper also addresses privacy concerns, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The proposed adversarial learning framework involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a machine learning technique, and thus could be related to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
