The problem of finding an optimal path model involves combinatorial optimization, which is a common topic in algorithms and data structures, suggesting cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as another likely sub-category. The problem also involves information theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible sub-category.
