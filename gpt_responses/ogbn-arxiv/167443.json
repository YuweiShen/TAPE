The method is based on least square regression (LSR), which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The method is also discriminative, which suggests it involves some form of classification or pattern recognition (cs.AI). The experiments involve various databases, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
