The paper also uses a neural encoder-decoder architecture, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper discusses the performance of the compressed embeddings on several benchmarks, which is a common evaluation method in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of pre-training on Wikipedia sentences, which is a common technique in both natural language processing and machine learning (cs.CV, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
