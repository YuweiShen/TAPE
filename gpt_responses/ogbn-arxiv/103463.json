Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves training strategies and optimization techniques, which are related to machine learning (LG) and signal processing (SI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed methods on a specific dataset, which falls under the sub-category of speech recognition (SD).
