This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design and implementation of a complete transceiver chain for the PUSCH in 5G NR, which involves synchronization, channel estimation, and equalization techniques. These are relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a software implementation of a complete transceiver chain for the PUSCH in 5G NR, which involves control and optimization of system parameters for efficient communication.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): Although the paper focuses on software implementation, it may also be relevant to hardware architecture as it discusses the functional building blocks of the system and their impact on performance.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper may be relevant to multimedia as 5G NR is expected to support high-speed data transfer and low-latency communication, which are important for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
