This involves protecting sensitive information while sharing usage logs to detect potential threats. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with privacy-preserving techniques for sharing sensitive information, which falls under the scope of cryptography and security. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of smart home environments on society and the challenges of managing data generated by them. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a distributed approach for threat hunting that involves sharing information between different parties, which is relevant to social and information networks. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the challenges of managing and analyzing data generated by smart home environments, which involves human-computer interaction. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a scenario for proactive threat intelligence sharing in smart home environments, which involves retrieving relevant information to detect potential threats."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
