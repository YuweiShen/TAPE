This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with natural language processing techniques such as attention, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories.
