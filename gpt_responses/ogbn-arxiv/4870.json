The most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as kernelization is a technique used in algorithm design. The paper also involves computational geometry, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as a likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorics, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as likely sub-categories.
