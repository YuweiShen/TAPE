The use of curves on a grid suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The concept of 4-connectivity is related to graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the use of a modification of a previous representation technique suggests a possible connection to software engineering and programming (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
