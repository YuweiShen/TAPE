This problem is closely related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR), as well as data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes new algorithms that achieve optimal sample complexity, which is a topic of interest in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG), and the problem of query release is a common task in databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
