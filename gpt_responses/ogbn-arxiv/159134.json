It also involves the use of Deep Boltzmann Machines and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of Robust Deep Boltzmann Machines, which are a form of Robust Boltzmann Machines. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper introduces new fitting algorithms with occlusion awareness, which involves the use of masks obtained from the RDBM reconstruction. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. \n\nThe paper evaluates its proposed approach using challenging face datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of Deep Boltzmann Machines and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, which are commonly used in Neural Networks (cs.NE).
