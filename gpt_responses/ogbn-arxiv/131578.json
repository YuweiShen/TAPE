This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the regularization of large models, which is a common topic in the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of activation functions is also relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
