This falls under the domain of information theory.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a deep neural network-based autoencoder for end-to-end learning of the communication system. This falls under the domain of neural computing.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for communication system design and implementation.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the robustness of the proposed system against sampling synchronization errors and non-linear amplifier impairments, which falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed communication system can be used for multimedia applications, such as video and audio streaming, which falls under the domain of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
