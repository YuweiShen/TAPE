This is a core topic in machine learning.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): EVMs are a type of probabilistic model, which is a core topic in AI. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimality of EVMs for a large class of functions, which is relevant to AI.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the concept of exchangeability, which is a fundamental concept in information theory.
