This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and transmission power. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions potential application scenarios such as D2D communications in hotspots such as game stadiums and airports, which involve multimedia content delivery. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper introduces the idea of mobile crowd sensing to collect active spectrum measurements from massive personal mobile devices, which involves social and information networks. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the interference constraint from the licensed DTV services and proposes an opportunistic spatial reuse algorithm for each D2D link to determine its MPEP, which involves security and cryptography concepts such as interference avoidance and signal encryption."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
