Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance improvement of neural parsers through incorporating pre-trained encoder representations, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the generalization on English and Chinese corpora, which could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
