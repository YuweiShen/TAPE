This falls under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a spatio-temporal activity-centers algorithm to model users' behavior more accurately, which involves data modeling and analysis, falling under the Databases (cs.DB) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
