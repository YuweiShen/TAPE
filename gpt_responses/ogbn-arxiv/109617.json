The methodology, called successive subspace learning (SSL), involves both unsupervised and supervised dimension reduction, which are key techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the comparison between SSL and deep learning, which is a popular subfield in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the proposed method, PixelHop, is an image processing technique, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
