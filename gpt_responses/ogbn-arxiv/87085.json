The use of signal temporal logic (STL) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) also suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific applications mentioned, such as autonomous driving and aircraft electric power systems, suggest a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and programming languages (cs.PL) for specifying and implementing the controllers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
