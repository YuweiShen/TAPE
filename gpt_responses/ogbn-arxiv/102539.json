The approach leverages inherent robustness properties of well-trained models, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach is applied to natural language processing (NLP) classifiers, which falls under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) domain. Finally, the approach is scalable and modular, which is a common topic in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
