Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). However, the paper also discusses the use of artificial neural networks, which falls under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper deals with small datasets, which is a common issue in machine learning, and could be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the transferability of the models to different languages, which could be classified under cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
