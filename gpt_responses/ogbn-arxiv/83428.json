This topic is closely related to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are subfields of computer science. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories for this paper. The paper also uses statistical measures, which are commonly used in machine learning and data mining, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper deals with linguistic evidence, which is related to the study of language and linguistics, making cs.CY (Computational Linguistics) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
