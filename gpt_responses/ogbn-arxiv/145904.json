Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of a hierarchical model and scope-based normalization features also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
