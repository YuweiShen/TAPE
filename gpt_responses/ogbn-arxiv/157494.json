The proposed method involves linear interpolation of labeled sample pairs, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the robustness and generalization power of the proposed method, which are topics in computer security (cs.CR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
