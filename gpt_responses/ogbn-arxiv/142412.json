Computer vision techniques are used for pupil detection and tracking, calibration, and accurate gaze estimation. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on the development of an open source platform for mobile eye tracking and gaze-based interaction. The system is designed to be accessible and affordable, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications in industry and research. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for playback and visualization of video and gaze data. The GUI is platform-independent and can be used to analyze and interpret the data collected by the eye tracking system. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions the use of the eye tracking system for human-robot interaction. The system can be used to track the gaze of a user and provide feedback to a robot, which can improve the interaction between humans and robots. \n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper presents an open source software framework for mobile eye tracking. The framework is designed to be extensible and customizable, which allows users to develop their own applications and algorithms for gaze-based interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
