The use of graph-mining-based algorithms to extract reliable experts from the crowd workers is a key contribution of the paper. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories of computer science, including Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), and Cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
