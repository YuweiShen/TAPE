The paper also discusses the composition of ML pipelines from hundreds of primitives from various libraries. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of automated machine learning and the creation of Docker containers that run on Kubernetes clusters within DARPA to provide an execution environment for automated machine learning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions advanced video/image classification as one of the ML domains covered by MARVIN. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of Docker containers that run on Kubernetes clusters within DARPA to provide an execution environment for automated machine learning. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of the MARVIN tool, a web-based application and associated back-end interface written in Python that enables composition of ML pipelines from hundreds of primitives from various libraries."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
