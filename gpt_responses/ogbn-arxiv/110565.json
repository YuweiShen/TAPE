The proposed approach involves the use of an extended Jacobian matrix, which is a common tool in robotics and control theory (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of numerical simulations to illustrate the properties of the proposed method, which is a common approach in robotics research (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper involves the use of algorithms to solve inverse kinematics problems, which is a topic commonly studied in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to task execution that involves the use of functional redundancy, which is a topic that can be relevant to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
