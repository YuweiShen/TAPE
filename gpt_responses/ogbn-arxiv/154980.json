The paper also involves image processing techniques such as wavelet transform and Hilbert transform, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The Log-Gabor iris encoder is a well-known technique in iris recognition, so it is likely that the paper would be categorized under cs.LG (Log-Gabor). Finally, the paper involves encoding techniques, which are related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
