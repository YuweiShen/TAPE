This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) since the paper discusses the use of Spark for processing the data. The paper also mentions the use of databases (cs.DB) and software engineering (cs.SE) in the implementation of the prototype system. Finally, the paper discusses the threat models and protection guarantees, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
