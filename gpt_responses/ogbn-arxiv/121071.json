The method involves optimizing the conditional entropy of unlabeled target data with respect to the classifier and feature encoder. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
