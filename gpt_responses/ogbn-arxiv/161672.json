Therefore, cs.NI (Networks and Internet Architecture) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses control overhead, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of routing protocols, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
