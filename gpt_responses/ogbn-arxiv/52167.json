This suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE). The mention of hardware and software heterogeneity suggests a potential fit with computer architecture (cs.AR) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the focus on system scale and correctness tools suggests a potential fit with control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
