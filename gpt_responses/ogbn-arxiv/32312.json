The proposed method involves a layered data structure, block-based intra prediction, adaptive transform, and entropy coding. These techniques are commonly used in computer graphics (cs.GR), computer vision (cs.CV), and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques (cs.IT) and computational geometry (cs.CG) methods. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.MM, cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.CG, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
