The use of linear beamforming strategies also suggests a possible connection to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed Branch-and-Bound method and the comparison of suboptimal techniques with global optimal solutions may be relevant to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
