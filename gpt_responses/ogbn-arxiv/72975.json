This involves reasoning about the semantics and validity of logical assertions in the context of quantum computation, which is highly non-deterministic and has a large impact on the definitions of the semantics. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category deals with the use of logic in computer science, including formal methods, automated reasoning, and proof theory. The paper's focus on logical analysis of entanglement and separability in a quantum computation language makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages, including functional programming languages. The paper's focus on a functional quantum computation language with higher-order functions makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): This sub-category deals with emerging technologies in computer science, including quantum computing. The paper's focus on quantum computation and its impact on logical analysis makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems, including those that involve quantum computing.
