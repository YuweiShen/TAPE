The authors prove the existence of Arrow-Debreu equilibrium and analyze the equilibrium with respect to uniqueness, Pareto-efficiency, and social-optimality. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the downlink of a small cell network, where small cells are powered solely through ambient energy harvesting. The authors propose a distributed user association scheme that converges to the equilibrium. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the uncertainty of the amount of harvested energy, which is a random variable without a priori known statistical characteristics. The authors model the network as an exchange economy with uncertainty and analyze the equilibrium properties. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a distributed user association scheme based on the Walras\u2019 tatonnoment process and the static knapsack problem. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed model through intensive numerical analysis. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper presents a user association problem in a competitive market with self-interested small cells and users, which can be modeled as a multiagent system.
