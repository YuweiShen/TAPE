The method proposed uses vision-based techniques (cs.CV) and optimization algorithms (cs.AI) to improve the accuracy of the tracking. The use of physics simulation as a forward model also involves system dynamics (cs.SY). Finally, the use of GPU acceleration and parallel computing is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
