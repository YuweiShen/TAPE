This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as well as computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE) since the application is in the medical field. The use of medical feature embedding also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the handling of high dimensionality in EHRs implies a potential connection to databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
