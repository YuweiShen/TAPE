The use of Bayesian methods for uncertainty estimation and the novel spike-and-slab dropout-based variational inference approach suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential for natural language processing (cs.CL) applications of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
