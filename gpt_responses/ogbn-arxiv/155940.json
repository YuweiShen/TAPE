Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Sound (cs.SD) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed solution involves the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for sound classification, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions the possibility of using automated machine learning, which is a sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
