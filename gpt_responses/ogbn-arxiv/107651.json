The problems are represented as graph optimization problems, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) category. The use of ordinal preference information to approximate solutions is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social choice theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis to prove the effectiveness of the ordinal approximation algorithm, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
