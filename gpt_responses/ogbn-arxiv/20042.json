The use of these features helps in selecting the main point or key sentence in the articles to be compared, reducing time and space usage for the comparison process without affecting the effectiveness of the plagiarism detection. This paper involves natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, and data structures, which are the main areas covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.CL, cs.IR, cs.LG, cs.CR, and cs.DS. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
