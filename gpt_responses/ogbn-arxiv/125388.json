Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a method that involves deep learning and feature encoding, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on improving emotion recognition performance, which is related to Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves analyzing and processing large datasets, which is related to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
