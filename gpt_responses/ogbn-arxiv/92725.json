This involves the use of shared factors as in the Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) and the division of the GRBM hidden layer into speaker and channel factors. The paper also proposes various new scoring techniques for speaker verification using GRBM. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SD (Sound), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
