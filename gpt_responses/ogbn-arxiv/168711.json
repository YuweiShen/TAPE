The paper also discusses the use of jamming signals, which falls under the category of network intrusion detection and prevention (cs.NI). The proposed power allocation strategy involves optimization, which is a common theme in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of the proposed system model to multiple relays and Willies, which involves multiple access communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
