The paper proposes a novel coded delivery scheme, which involves the use of storage and caching, and thus could also be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between memory and load, which is a common theme in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper is focused on optimizing the performance of the caching scheme, which is a topic in computer networks (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
