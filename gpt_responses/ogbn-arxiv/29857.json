Additionally, the paper discusses the linguistic challenges associated with this task, which is a common theme in the cs.CL sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques to train data-to-text surface realisers, which makes it relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the creation of a benchmark for data-to-text generation, which involves the use of evaluation metrics and criteria. This makes it relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which deals with the development and evaluation of intelligent systems. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of statistical analysis and manual evaluation, which makes it relevant to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category, which deals with the analysis and retrieval of information from large datasets. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the development of high-quality data-to-text surface realisers, which involves the use of neural networks and other machine learning techniques. This makes it relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category, which deals with the development and application of neural networks and other evolutionary algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
