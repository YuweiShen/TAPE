The paper proposes a standardized benchmark for evaluating DRL algorithms, which is related to the sub-category of optimization and learning (cs.LG). The use of Atari games as a benchmark involves computer vision (cs.CV) and game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the reproducibility of results, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
