This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including data mining (cs.DM), computer vision (cs.CV), social networks (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper proposes a new framework for seeded graph matching that employs high order structural information and Personalized PageRank, which are techniques commonly used in these sub-fields. Therefore, it is likely that the paper belongs to one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
