The paper also discusses the use of bigram and trigram embeddings, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper's focus on improving word embeddings for various tasks suggests that it could also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
