The focus is on massive MIMO, which is a subfield of millimeter wave communication (cs.MM). The paper also considers hybrid architectures, which are commonly used in wireless networks (cs.NI). The proposed algorithms involve optimization and statistical inference, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the role of system parameters in channel estimation, which is relevant to control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
