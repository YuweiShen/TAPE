The proposed efficient operator for Euclidean projection is also a key building block for projection-based methods, which are widely used in machine learning. \n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a bisection algorithm to solve the problem of Euclidean projection onto the intersection of norm balls, which is a numerical optimization problem. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the time complexity of the proposed solution and compares it with other methods, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper mentions that the auxiliary function used in the bisection algorithm is piecewise smooth and monotonic, which is a topic in symbolic computation. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions the use of composite norm constraints in regression problems, which is a topic in information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
