The use of large antenna arrays and signal processing algorithms also falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on millimeter wave signals, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of scatterers and algorithms for estimation, which are topics related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
