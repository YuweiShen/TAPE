The proposed framework involves the use of non-local relationships and iterative diffusion in the feature space, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of the proposed framework for autonomous driving, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper reports state-of-the-art or competitive results on three related datasets, which is a common evaluation metric in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
