It also involves the use of neural-net-guided Monte Carlo tree search self-play, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence research. The cs.LG sub-category is also likely as it involves machine learning techniques to improve the learning process. The use of convolutional neural networks for board evaluation in Go also suggests a possible connection to the cs.CV sub-category. The cs.GT sub-category is relevant as Go is a game with well-defined rules and strategies, making it a topic of interest in game theory research. Finally, the cs.NE sub-category is relevant as the paper involves the use of neural networks for learning and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
