The use of deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is also a key aspect of the paper, which makes it relevant to the subfield of deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper focuses on improving the performance of blind steganalysis, which involves detecting hidden messages without prior knowledge of the steganographic algorithm used. This makes it relevant to the subfield of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
