Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to extract relevant information from the HealthMap news corpus, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely category. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as word2vec, which suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as other possible categories.
