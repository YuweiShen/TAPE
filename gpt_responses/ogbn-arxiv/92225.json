The paper also introduces a new method for enforcing consistent mappings during translation, which involves learning harmonic functions over a sample graph. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper includes experimental results in a number of applications, including medical imaging and semantic labeling, which could be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
