The paper also discusses the equivalence of these semantics with reduction semantics, which is a topic often studied in the subfield of programming language semantics (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses denotational semantics, which is a topic commonly studied in the subfield of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of global heaps and evaluation suspension, which are topics commonly studied in the subfield of programming language implementation (cs.SE) and type theory (cs.TL). Finally, the paper discusses the adequacy of the semantics, which is a topic commonly studied in the subfield of formal methods (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
