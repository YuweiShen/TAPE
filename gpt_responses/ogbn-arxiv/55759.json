The paper also mentions the use of epsilon-greedy exploration, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning. \n\nThe paper also deals with privacy-preserving techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. \n\nThe use of features and the need to keep them private suggests that the paper could also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on learning from data and maximizing rewards suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of differential privacy suggests that it could also belong to the cyber security (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
