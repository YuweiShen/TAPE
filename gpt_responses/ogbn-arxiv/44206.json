Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM) aspects, which makes cs.IR and cs.MM likely categories as well. The paper also deals with security and privacy issues related to crisis data, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible category.
