Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of information and communication. The paper also discusses the practical system design and performance evaluations, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper mentions field trials and standardization activities, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
