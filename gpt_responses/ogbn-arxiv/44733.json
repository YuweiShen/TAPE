The use of sparse structure and adaptive algorithms also suggests a potential connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the simulation results mentioned in the abstract suggest that multimedia (cs.MM) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
