The focus is on the design, manufacturing, and evaluation of the screw, which can passively morph into the drilled curved tunnels with various curvatures. \n2. cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper describes the implementation of a curved drilling technique for internal fixation of bone fractures and focuses on the design and manufacturing of a novel bendable medical screw. \n3. cs.BIO (Computational Biology): The paper discusses the use of a novel bendable medical screw for internal fixation of bone fractures and evaluates its performance and efficacy using finite element simulations and experiments conducted on synthetic bone samples. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not a primary focus, the paper mentions the use of imaging techniques such as X-ray and CT scans for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper includes images and videos of the proposed robot-assisted procedure and the bendable medical screw in action."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
