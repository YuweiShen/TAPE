The paper focuses on cross-lingual natural language inference, cross-lingual document classification, and parallel corpus mining. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses machine learning techniques to learn a classifier on top of the resulting embeddings, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses a new test set of aligned sentences in 112 languages, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper also discusses multilingual similarity search, which could be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
