The paper discusses techniques for handling quantifiers, which suggests that it belongs to the logic (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also mentions applications in query reformulation, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses clausification, which is a technique used in programming language semantics (cs.PL) and automated reasoning (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses postprocessing steps, which suggests that it may also belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
