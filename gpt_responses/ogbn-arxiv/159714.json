This involves predicting the future locations of surrounding flying objects and classifying them into different groups with similar levels of maneuverability. This work is relevant to the field of robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with autonomous and cooperative UAVs. It also involves machine learning (cs.AI) as an unsupervised learning algorithm is used. The paper also mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) for object profiling. Additionally, the work is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY) as it aims to facilitate control and communication protocols in UAV networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
