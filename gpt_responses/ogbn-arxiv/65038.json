This falls under the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Planning and Scheduling (cs.PL). The use of landmarks and their reasonable orders involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the implementation of the approach involves software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
