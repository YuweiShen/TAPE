This work is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.MM) as it involves developing algorithms for automatic subtle emotion recognition. The paper also discusses the importance of recognizing subtle emotions in various real-life situations, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on two well-established and publicly available databases, which could be of interest to researchers working in the field of neuroscience and psychology (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
