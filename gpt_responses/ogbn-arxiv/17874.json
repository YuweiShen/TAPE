The paper utilizes stochastic geometry and queueing theory to develop a spatiotemporal mathematical framework to analyze and assess the performance of the two paradigms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also involves information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), machine learning (cs.MA), and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
