The paper specifically focuses on two tasks, machine translation and semantic parsing, which are both subfields of natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also introduces a novel token-level ramp loss objective, which is a technique used in optimization and training of neural models, falling under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of neural models in image captioning, which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of metric-augmented objectives, which is a technique used in optimization and training of neural models, falling under the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
