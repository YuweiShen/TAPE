The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence techniques such as reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and the optimization of reward functions (cs.LG). The paper also touches upon the control and coordination of the agents (cs.SY) and the use of computer simulations to test the proposed framework (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
