The proposed solution involves using sampling and iterative procedures, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the accuracy of the optimizer, which is related to security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed solution in terms of overhead and performance, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
