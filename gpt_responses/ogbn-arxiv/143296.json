The paper also mentions scenarios where channel hardening is not sufficiently pronounced, such as small scattering angular spread and cell-free massive MIMO, which are topics of interest in the signal processing (cs.SI) and communication (cs.COM) communities. Finally, the paper specifically mentions the use of zero-forcing beamforming, which is a common technique in massive MIMO (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
