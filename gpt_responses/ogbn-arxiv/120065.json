This topic is closely related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it aims to improve the user experience of data visualization. The paper also involves graph drawing (cs.GR) as it deals with creating visual representations of data. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of data management (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR) in the process of applying style templates to new data sources. Finally, the paper touches on the topic of social and information networks (cs.SI) as it demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of source datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
