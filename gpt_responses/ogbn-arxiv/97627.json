The lower bounds for the expected number of Pareto optima are derived using results in geometry connected to arrangements of hyperplanes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves the analysis of algorithms for multiobjective optimization problems, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms. The lower bounds for the expected number of Pareto optima are derived using techniques such as smoothed analysis, which are commonly used in the analysis of algorithms. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper involves the study of multiobjective optimization problems, which are often studied in the context of game theory. The lower bounds for the expected number of Pareto optima are derived using techniques such as hyperplane arrangements, which are also used in the study of game theory. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves the analysis of numerical methods for solving multiobjective optimization problems. The lower bounds for the expected number of Pareto optima are derived using techniques such as smoothed analysis, which are commonly used in numerical analysis. \n5. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper involves the study of multiobjective optimization problems"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
