The paper also introduces an extension of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), which is a formal language used in programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also mentions the use of Bounded Model Checking (BMC), which is a technique used in hardware design (cs.DC) and software verification (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and formal verification (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
