The paper proposes a new training method called Image-Text-Image (I2T2I) which integrates text-to-image and image-to-text synthesis to improve the performance of text-to-image synthesis. This work involves computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.CV and cs.CL. The paper also uses recurrent neural networks (RNN) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are machine learning (ML) techniques, indicating that it could be classified under cs.LG and cs.AI. Finally, the paper deals with synthesizing objects with complex shapes, such as animals and humans, which could be categorized under cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
