It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as the authors train a 3D CNN to detect Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as the CNN is used for automatic medical decision making. Neural networks (cs.NE) is also a likely sub-category as the paper deals with training and interpreting a neural network. Finally, human-computer interaction (cs.HC) is a possible sub-category as the paper discusses the importance of understanding the decisions of a CNN to increase trust in computer-based decision support systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
