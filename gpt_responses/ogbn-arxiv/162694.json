The use of Transfer Entropy (TE) and Mutual Information (MI) suggests that the paper is related to Information Theory (cs.IT). The proposed estimator is based on neural networks, which indicates a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural Networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions transportation, social, neural, and gene-regulatory networks, which suggests a Systems and Control (cs.SY) perspective. Finally, the paper aims to discount synergistic information, which is related to Causal Inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
