Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also discusses coding opportunities and outer-bounds, which are topics in communication systems (cs.COMM) and network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of feedback links, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of results to non-homogeneous settings, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
