Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also discusses deep neural networks, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper also deals with noise injection, which could fall under cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
