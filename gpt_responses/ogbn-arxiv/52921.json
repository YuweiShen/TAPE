It also involves the use of polynomials, which is a common tool in coding theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the parameters of the designs, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of quadratic functions over finite fields suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
