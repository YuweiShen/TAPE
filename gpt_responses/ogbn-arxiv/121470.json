The paper also discusses the risks associated with sending user data to cloud servers, which relates to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. The proposed framework involves adversarial training, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the framework's performance using metrics such as multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM), which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
