The paper proposes a solution using the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which is a common tool in control theory and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also involves optimizing the decision-making process using threshold policies, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the specific challenges of millimeter wave communication, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
