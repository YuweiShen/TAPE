This involves beamforming and power control, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also formulates the problem mathematically and uses dual decomposition, which are techniques commonly used in control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of simulation results, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
