It considers different types of multi-antenna transmission techniques and analyzes their coverage probability, per user rate, and area spectral efficiency (ASE). This involves the use of tools from stochastic orders and upper bounds on the coverage probability. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
