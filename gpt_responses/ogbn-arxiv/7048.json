The focus on learning non-linear functional dependencies from high-dimensional data sets suggests a strong connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence, while the discussion of adversarial attacks and robustness points towards computer security and cryptography. The mention of data sets also suggests a connection to computer vision, and the use of high-dimensional data sets suggests a potential connection to neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
