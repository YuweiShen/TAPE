This involves the use of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques to extract features from video and physiological signals. The system also involves the use of robotics (cs.RO) to provide automated interventions based on the pain assessment. Finally, the paper discusses the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspects of the system, including the need for user-friendly interfaces and the importance of involving caregivers in the development process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
