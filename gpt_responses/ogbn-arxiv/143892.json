This is a key area of research in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the design of a new contention control mechanism to ensure that the number of admitted grant-free users is carefully controlled and the interference from the grant-free users to the grant-based users is effectively suppressed. This is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new communication scenario that involves a combination of grant-based and grant-free protocols. This requires the design of new control mechanisms to ensure that the system operates correctly. This is a key area of research in systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve connectivity and spectral efficiency. This is a key area of research in multimedia, as it can help to improve the quality of multimedia transmission.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the design of a new contention control mechanism to ensure that the interference from the grant-free users to the grant-based users is effectively suppressed.
