The approach is validated on image classification datasets, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The use of mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and optimization also suggests control and optimization (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with identifying critical neurons and removing non-critical ones, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
