It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the proposed method can be useful for learning restricted classes of functions. Additionally, it may be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper discusses the trade-off between per-iteration work and the number of iterations needed on problems with a large number of constraints. It may also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as constrained optimization is often used in computer vision tasks. Finally, it may be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the paper proposes a method for staying close to the feasible region while only applying constraints probabilistically at each iteration, which can be useful in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
