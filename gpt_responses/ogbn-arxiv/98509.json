The task of cross-lingual keyword spotting involves mapping keywords in one language to spoken utterances in another language, which could also fall under speech processing (cs.SD). The use of neural networks for this task also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
