The specific techniques used, such as semantic matching and answer position inferring, are commonly used in NLP research and are often found in papers related to computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates its model on two popular NLP datasets, SQuAD and MARCO, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
