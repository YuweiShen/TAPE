This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as the model is trained on image-based data. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of attention-based encoder-decoder architecture, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and deep learning (cs.DL). The dataset used in the paper is generated by matching XML and PDF representations of scientific articles, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the proposed Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for table recognition is a measure of similarity between two trees, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
