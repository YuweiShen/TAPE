This involves the use of coordinate fingerprints and a deep neural network (DNN) to map the measured position information of a user to the optimal phase configurations of the RIS for signal power focusing. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of information processing, transmission, and storage. The paper's focus on optimizing signal power focusing in indoor communication environments aligns with the goals of this sub-category.\n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category deals with the design, analysis, and implementation of networked systems and protocols. The paper's focus on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for indoor communication environments aligns with the goals of this sub-category.\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. The paper's use of deep learning for optimizing the configuration of RISs aligns with the goals of this sub-category.\n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents and systems that can perceive their environment, reason, and act.
