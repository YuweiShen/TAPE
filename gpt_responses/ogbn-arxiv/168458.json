The paper's focus on maximizing submodular functions subject to constraints is also relevant to machine learning applications. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Submodular functions have been used in various AI applications, such as summarization, recommendation systems, and active learning. The paper's focus on maximizing submodular functions subject to constraints is also relevant to AI applications. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): Submodular functions have connections to information theory, particularly in the context of entropy and mutual information. The paper's focus on maximizing submodular functions subject to constraints may also have information-theoretic implications. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper derives a lower bound on the approximation ratio of any polynomial time algorithm for the problem of maximizing submodular functions subject to constraints, which is a classic topic in computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
