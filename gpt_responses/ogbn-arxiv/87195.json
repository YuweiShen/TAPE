The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian neural networks, which are a type of probabilistic machine learning model, indicating a potential fit for the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of sensors and image processing for autonomous driving also suggests a potential fit for computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the safety guarantees and decision making involved in autonomous driving, indicating a potential fit for systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
