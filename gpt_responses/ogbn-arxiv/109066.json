The use of ontologies and machine learning techniques suggests that this paper could fall under the categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Databases (cs.DB), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The two drug-repurposing systems described in the paper, one based on information retrieval and the other based on non-negative matrix factorization, suggest that this paper could also fall under the categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
