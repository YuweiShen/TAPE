This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of these models for forecasting in photovoltaic systems suggests a potential application in systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of traditional regression approaches, which could fall under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA) or statistics (cs.ST). Finally, the paper presents a non-parametric approach to probabilistic forecasting, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
