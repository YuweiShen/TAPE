The paper also considers the impact of coexisting competing radio access technologies on the system performance, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the expected battery lifetime, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR).
