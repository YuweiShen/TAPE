Additionally, the paper focuses on high dynamic range (HDR) images, which are often used in multimedia applications (cs.MM). The use of neural networks also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses perceptual masking effects, which are related to human perception and could fall under graphics (cs.GR) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
