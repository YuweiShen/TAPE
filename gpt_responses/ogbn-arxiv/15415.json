This involves designing a system that supports effective communication between workers and provides context-specific arguments targeted to their reasoning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HCI, which deals with human-computer interaction and user-centered design. The paper also involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques to improve crowd accuracy, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.CL (computational linguistics) and cs.AI (artificial intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of argumentation to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional approaches, which could be classified under cs.CY (computational complexity) and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
