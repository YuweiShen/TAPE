The use of approximate message passing (AMP) methods is a popular approach to solving this problem, and the paper specifically focuses on the convergence of AMP under general transforms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also discusses the use of quadratic cost functions, which is a common topic in machine learning and optimization, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) may also be a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of damping in the GAMP algorithm, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing and communication systems, suggesting that cs.SP (Signal Processing) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper uses numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, suggesting that cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
