The paper focuses on algebraic constructions and properties of interleavers, which suggests that it belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the spread factor of interleavers, which is a measure of their performance, and proposes a new interleaver metric that takes into account both the spread factor and a new nonlinearity metric. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Graph Theory (cs.GT) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also presents an infinite sequence of quadratic permutation polynomials, which are used to generate maximum-spread interleavers, indicating that it may belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper includes extensive computer simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed interleaver metric, which suggests that it may also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
