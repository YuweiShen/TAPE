The paper proposes a two-mode Labeled Hidden Markov Model to detect spammers based on the temporal patterns of reviewers' posting rates. This approach involves analyzing the transitions between different states of posting rates, which is a typical problem in computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also uses co-bursting behaviors to detect spammer groups, which involves analyzing the relationships between reviewers and products, a typical problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and social network analysis (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to detect spam, which is a common problem in cybersecurity (cs.CR) and data mining (cs.SD). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL, cs.IR, cs.SI, cs.CR, and cs.SD, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
