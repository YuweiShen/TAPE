This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the strategies used by poker agents, which are represented as binary files. This suggests the use of AI techniques to compute these strategies, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents algorithms that learn from a training set of game instances and solutions. This indicates the use of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions private information distributions in poker games, which can be seen as a security concern. This makes cs.CR a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the algorithms used to compute equilibrium strategies in poker games. This suggests the use of data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
