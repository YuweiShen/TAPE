The approach involves exploring local patterns in multiscale data using deep learning to construct and explore the relationship between physical features and simulation errors. This involves techniques such as feature similarity measurement, empirical correlations, and the effect of mesh size. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a data-driven approach using deep learning to improve the credibility of thermal-hydraulic simulation codes. This involves techniques such as feature similarity measurement and exploring the relationship between physical features and simulation errors.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a data-driven approach using machine learning to improve the credibility of thermal-hydraulic simulation codes. This involves techniques such as deep learning and exploring the relationship between physical features and simulation errors.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a data-driven approach using deep learning to improve the credibility of thermal-hydraulic simulation codes.
