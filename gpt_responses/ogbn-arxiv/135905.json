This topic is closely related to the fields of neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of approximation models in evolutionary algorithms, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with optimization problems, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
