The paper also introduces a new optimization algorithm, Dragon Fly (DF), which is a swarm intelligent optimization algorithm and falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The algorithm is evaluated through different experiments and benchmarks, which could also fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The paper also discusses the design and adaptation of the algorithm, which could fall under the programming languages (cs.PL) category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed technique and algorithm could involve machine learning techniques, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
