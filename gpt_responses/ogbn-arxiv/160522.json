The concept of border support rank is closely related to the complexity of matrix multiplication algorithms, and is therefore likely to be studied in the theoretical computer science community. This suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algebraic geometry and tensor decomposition, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper mentions applications in quantum communication complexity, which suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
