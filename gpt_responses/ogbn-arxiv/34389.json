The paper also mentions the use of neural models, such as BERT, which is a popular model in the sub-field of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of efficient models, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
