This involves optimizing power allocation and beam allocation at the transmitter, and utilizing hybrid detection at the receiver. These concepts are related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
