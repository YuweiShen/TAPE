This involves transforming task behaviors to adapt to new tasks zero-shot. The paper draws inspiration from functional programming and recent work in meta-learning to propose a class of Homoiconic Meta-Mapping (HoMM) approaches that represent data points and tasks in a shared latent space, and learn to infer transformations of that space. HoMM approaches can be applied to any type of machine learning task, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
