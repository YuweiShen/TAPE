The problem of aggregation in trees is also relevant to game theory (cs.GT), as it involves making decisions based on the actions of other agents. The paper proposes online algorithms for the problem, which falls under the subfield of algorithms (cs.AL). The problem is also relevant to networked systems and communication, which falls under the subfield of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI).
