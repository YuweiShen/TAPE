This falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. The paper also makes use of geometric insights and techniques, which suggests a possible fit under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves optimization and numerical analysis, which could place it under the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper includes simulations, which could potentially place it under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
