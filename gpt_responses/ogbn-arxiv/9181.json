Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions multiple-description coded (MDC) video content, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of SDN also falls under the category of cs.SD (Software Engineering), and the optimization of video quality falls under cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of network load, which is related to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
