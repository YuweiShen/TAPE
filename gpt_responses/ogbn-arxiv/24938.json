The paper also discusses logical formalisms such as default logic, autoepistemic logic, and circumscription, which fall under the category of logic and computation (cs.LO). The paper also mentions argument systems, which are used to formalize commonsense reasoning, and thus can be classified under computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the principle of negation as failure, which is a concept in the field of constraint reasoning (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions possibilistic logic, which is a type of uncertainty reasoning, and thus can be classified under programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
