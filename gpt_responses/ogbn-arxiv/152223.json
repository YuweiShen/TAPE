This is a common problem in machine learning and optimization, which falls under the category of \"Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The use of batches of fixed size for parallel evaluation is a technique commonly used in distributed computing and parallel algorithms, which falls under the category of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY). Finally, the use of Gaussian processes and active selection of evaluation points is also a common technique in the field of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
