The proposed approach involves hidden factor analysis and sparse representation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are carried out on face aging databases, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
