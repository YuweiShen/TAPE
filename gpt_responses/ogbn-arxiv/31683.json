This involves the use of robotics and control systems to operate the vehicle and its sensing capabilities. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The interlock drive system and the in-situ measurement of ground properties require the integration of sensing and control systems. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the design and construction of lunar landing pads and blast walls, which involves computational modeling and simulation of the behavior of the interlocking spikes and the soil. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The concept of using interlocking spikes for traction and sensing in a lunar bulldozer is a novel and emerging technology. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper mentions the need for experiments on relevant soil simulants to better predict performance in a lunar or Martian environment, which may involve the development of software for simulation and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
