This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NI (Neuroscience and Neural Systems). Of these, cs.NE and cs.CV are the most likely categories, as the paper focuses on using AI models to understand the brain's neural activity during visual perception tasks. However, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.NI are also possible categories, as the paper touches on broader topics related to AI and neuroscience."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
