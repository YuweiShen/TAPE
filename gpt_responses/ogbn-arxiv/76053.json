The use of the Bhattacharyya parameter suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) since it deals with the complexity of transmitting information over a channel. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI) since these fields also deal with the transmission and processing of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
