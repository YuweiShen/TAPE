The use of ETX as a metric also involves information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the routing algorithm, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and system and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
