The use of randomized matrix algorithms and numerical linear algebra techniques also suggests that it could belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The focus on resiliency against stragglers in serverless architectures suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as well. Finally, the empirical validation of the results on real-world datasets suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
