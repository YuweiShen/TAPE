This involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the creation of a new human annotated dataset for evaluating content-based news recommendation systems, which falls under the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories.
