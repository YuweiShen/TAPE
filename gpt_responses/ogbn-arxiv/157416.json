Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a language model based attention mechanism for text recognition, which falls under the sub-category of natural language processing, i.e., cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper uses deep learning-based methods, which is a common technique in machine learning, and hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves instance segmentation-based text detection, which is a sub-field of computer vision and image processing, and hence, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a feasible framework for multi-lingual arbitrary-shaped STR, which involves the use of deep learning and language models, and hence, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
