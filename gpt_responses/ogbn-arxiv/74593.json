Information theory plays a crucial role in sub-Nyquist sampling techniques, and the paper discusses the theoretical bounds on the estimation accuracy.\n2. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with signal processing techniques for joint DOA and frequency estimation. The proposed algorithms are based on tensor decomposition and subspace decomposition, which are common signal processing techniques.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with social networks, the proposed receiver architecture can be used in wireless sensor networks, which are a type of social network. The paper discusses the performance of the proposed architecture under limited number of sensors, which is a common issue in wireless sensor networks.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed receiver architecture can be used in wireless communication systems, which fall under the domain of networking and internet architecture. The paper discusses the impact of the sampling rate on the estimation accuracy, which is a common issue in wireless communication systems.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with machine learning, the proposed algorithms for joint DOA and frequency estimation can be considered as machine learning techniques.
