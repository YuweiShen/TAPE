The paper also proposes a weakly supervised, segmentation-based approach to learn accurate detectors and image classifiers, which involves machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of search models for detection, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
