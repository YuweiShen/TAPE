The paper focuses on the performance of the proposed method on the game NoGo, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT). The use of deep neural networks for policy and value evaluation suggests that the paper could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a limited budget, which could suggest a connection to optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the use of neural networks for evaluation could also suggest a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
