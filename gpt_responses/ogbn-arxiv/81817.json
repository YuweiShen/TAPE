The paper also discusses threshold mismatched decoding, which is related to the sub-category of Information Theory and Probability (cs.ITP). The use of type-dependent metrics suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM). The study of strong converse and the proof of a conjecture suggest a possible connection to the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with capacity of channels, which is a topic in the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
