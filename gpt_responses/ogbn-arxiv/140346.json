It also involves techniques for solving the phase retrieval problem, which is a common problem in computer vision. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as singular value decomposition and semidefinite programming, which are commonly used in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves numerical experiments, which suggests that it may belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and optimization techniques, which are commonly studied in the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves information theory concepts such as the autocorrelation function, which suggests that it may belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
