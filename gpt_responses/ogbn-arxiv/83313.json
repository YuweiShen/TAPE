This involves perception, planning, and control modules to scan and reconstruct an object of interest without requiring a prior model. The system builds a voxel representation of the object and iteratively determines the Next-Best-View (NBV) to extend the representation, according to both the reconstruction itself and to avoid collisions with the environment. This involves computing the expected information gain of a set of candidate scan locations sampled on the as-sensed terrain map, as well as the cost of reaching these candidates, and planning an optimal path towards the NBV, avoiding obstacles and un-traversable terrain. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper describes the development of an online active mapping system for a quadruped robot to autonomously survey large physical structures, which involves perception, planning, and control modules to scan and reconstruct an object of interest without requiring a prior model. This falls under the scope of robotics. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves the development of a perception module to scan and reconstruct an object of interest without requiring a prior model. This involves computer vision techniques such as voxel representation and Next-Best-View (NBV) determination. \n-"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
