The use of optimal transport and local feature similarity suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach. The introduction of degrees of freedom for transformations and deformations of the shape template suggests a graphics (cs.GR) approach. Finally, the numerical experiments suggest a multimedia (cs.MM) approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
