The use of functional dependencies (FDs) to specify data semantics and detect violations is also a common technique in data management and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed algorithm for generating non-redundant solutions involves machine learning and optimization techniques, which are also relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and cryptography (cs.CR) communities. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the proposed approach for users, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
