The use of large antenna arrays and the need for adaptive algorithms also suggest a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SY). The focus on millimeter wave technology and the use of beam patterns suggest a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of maximum likelihood estimation and the need for optimization suggest a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
