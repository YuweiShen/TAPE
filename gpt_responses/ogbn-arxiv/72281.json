The use of dice and probability distributions also suggests a connection to probability theory and statistics (cs.IT). The feasibility constraints and matroid structure mentioned in the abstract are related to optimization and algorithms (cs.DS), while the study of efficient algorithms for constructing winner-selecting dice falls under machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
