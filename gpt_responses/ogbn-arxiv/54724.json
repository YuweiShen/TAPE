The proposed framework also considers the use of multi-antenna techniques, which falls under multimedia (MM) category. The paper also discusses interference constraint, which is a security (CR) concern. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
