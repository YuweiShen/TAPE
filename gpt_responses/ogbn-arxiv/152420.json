This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as the achievable data rates for diffusion-based channels are limited by the physical properties of the medium and the noise characteristics of the system. The paper also involves the use of particle-based simulators to model the channel's impulse response, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the proposed detection algorithms for symbol detection in the receiver involve signal processing and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
