The proposed solution involves using deep neural networks and automatic label quality evaluation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on biomedical image segmentation dataset, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also mentions an overfitting control module, which is a common problem in neural networks and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
