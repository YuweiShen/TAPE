The paper also evaluates the proposed method using node classification, link prediction, and clustering experiments.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with learning over graphs, which is a common topic in social and information networks. The paper also evaluates the proposed method using many real-world graphs from various domains.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithmic scheme for training the model parameters efficiently and in an unsupervised manner. The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed method in the face of large-scale real-world graphs.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning method for node embedding, which is a common task in artificial intelligence over graphs. The paper also evaluates the proposed method using node classification, link prediction, and clustering experiments.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of a tunable node similarity matrix, which assigns weights on paths of different length. The paper also discusses the interpretability of the resulting embeddings, which is a common topic in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
