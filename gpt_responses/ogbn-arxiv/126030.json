The use of visual attributes as a mode of communication also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the potential application of the proposed approach in scenarios with limited bandwidth suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
