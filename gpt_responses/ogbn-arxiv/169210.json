This approach involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG - The paper involves developing a framework for analyzing object movement data, which involves using statistical and machine learning techniques. This makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CV - The paper involves analyzing object movement data, which could involve using computer vision techniques to track the objects. This makes cs.CV a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.CR - The paper involves analyzing data related to traffic flow analysis, patient monitoring, and software operation, which could involve security and privacy concerns. This makes cs.CR a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DS - The paper involves developing a framework for analyzing object movement data, which involves using statistical and machine learning techniques.
