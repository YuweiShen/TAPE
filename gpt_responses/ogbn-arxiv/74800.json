This involves using noisy topological relations discovered by a robot exploring large-scale office spaces. The paper introduces Graph-Structured Sum-Product Networks (GraphSPNs) as a solution to this problem. Given the focus on probabilistic modeling and machine learning, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The use of robotics and exploration of large-scale office spaces suggests cs.RO as another likely sub-category. The paper also involves image processing and natural language processing, which could fall under cs.CV and cs.CL respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
