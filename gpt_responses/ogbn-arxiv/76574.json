Additionally, the paper focuses on the security aspect of communication, which falls under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of MIMO channels and Gaussian codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of wire-tappers, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new coding scheme, which may be relevant to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
