The use of singular value thresholding is common in image processing and computer vision (cs.CV), while the optimization techniques used in the paper are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the use of nonconvex surrogate functions, which is a topic of interest in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
