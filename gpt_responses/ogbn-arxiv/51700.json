Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also compares two different types of deep learning models, which suggests that it could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with spatiotemporal features, which could also place it under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
