Additionally, the paper also discusses the role of network capacity, which is a key aspect of deep learning models. The paper also involves computer vision tasks, which suggests it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). The study of adversarial attacks and defenses is also related to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper's focus on improving robustness through normalization techniques suggests it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
