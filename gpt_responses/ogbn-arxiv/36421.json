The paper also discusses the perception study conducted to model the perceived dominance levels of pedestrians, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the psychology literature related to human movement behaviors, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The algorithm presented in the paper uses machine learning techniques to predict dominance levels, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and social intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
