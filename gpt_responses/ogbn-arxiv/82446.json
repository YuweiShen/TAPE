The paper also discusses the transformation of non-binary LCD codes into binary LCD codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper presents a general construction of LCD codes from any linear codes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and algebra (cs.SI). Overall, the paper covers a broad range of topics in computer science, but the focus on coding theory and information theory suggests that cs.IT and cs.CR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
