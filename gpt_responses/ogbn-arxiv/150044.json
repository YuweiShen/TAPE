This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a novel curriculum sampling algorithm, which involves optimizing the training of deep learning models, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of curriculum learning and the optimization of deep learning models also suggests the possibility of neural networks (cs.NE) being involved. Finally, the paper deals with medical imaging, which could also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
