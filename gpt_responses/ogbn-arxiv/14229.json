The paper discusses the use of planar region representation of the environment, partial footholds, and post-processing of footstep plan solutions. These topics are closely related to robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), control systems (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
