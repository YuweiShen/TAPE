The use of machine learning and heuristics to extract metadata from bibliographic references also involves techniques from machine learning (ML) and computational linguistics (CL). The proposed approach, ParsRec, is based on meta-learning, which is a subfield of ML that deals with learning how to learn. This makes the paper relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation Linguistics), cs.DL (Deep Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
