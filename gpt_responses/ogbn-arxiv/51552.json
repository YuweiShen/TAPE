The use of hyperproperties to formalize different notions of killing mutants is a novel contribution, which suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of modeling languages, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of programming languages (cs.PL). The use of model checking tools suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also deals with reactive models, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper deals with testing, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
