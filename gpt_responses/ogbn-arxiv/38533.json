The use of logical specifications and temporal logic formulas suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The focus on workflow-oriented models and BPMN notation suggests that the paper may be relevant to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. The use of automated generation procedures and algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
