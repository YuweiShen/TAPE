The paper proposes a low-cost mechanism that exploits DRAM leakage characteristics and common access patterns to reduce DRAM access latency. This falls under the category of computer architecture and embedded systems. Other possible categories could be cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.PF (Performance), cs.ET (Embedded Systems), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
