This involves using language-conditioned image generation networks and training the model from demonstration only without external resources. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper proposes a model that involves goal prediction and action generation. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the model uses raw visual observations to generate goals and actions. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) as the paper involves generating actions to complete tasks in a 3D environment. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the model is trained from demonstration only without external resources. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the paper involves using language-conditioned image generation networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
