Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of adaptive computation for learning the number of inference steps required for examples of different complexity, which is a key area of research in the field of computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also touches upon topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as it proposes a model that uses adaptive computation to improve performance on reasoning tasks. The use of machine learning techniques to solve complex reasoning problems is a common theme in both of these sub-categories. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (cs.CV) and recurrent neural networks (cs.NE) in the proposed model, which are both commonly used in the field of machine learning.
