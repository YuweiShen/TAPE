The proposed method, Scampi, is based on approximate message-passing and operates in the compressive regime, where the inverse imaging problem is underdetermined. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces an expectation-maximization learning of model parameters, which is a machine learning technique, indicating that the paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also presents numerical experiments to compare the performance of Scampi with other methods, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
