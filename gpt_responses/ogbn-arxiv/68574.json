The paper also discusses the submodularity property of the objective function, which is a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science and falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper proposes a new algorithm for influence maximization, which involves machine learning techniques and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the hardness of approximation of the objective function, which is a complexity theory concept and falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
