The use of differential privacy suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with privacy-preserving machine learning. The paper also deals with matrix completion, which is a problem in linear algebra, suggesting that it may belong to the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), which deals with privacy and security in computer systems. The use of algorithms and computational methods suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.IT (Information Theory).
