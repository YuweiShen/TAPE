The proposed models also involve dealing with ambiguously and imprecisely labeled training data, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the use of multiple-instance learning framework is relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
