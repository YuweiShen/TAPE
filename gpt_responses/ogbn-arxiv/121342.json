This falls under the domain of game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves solving potential equations and obtaining verification equations with minimal numbers. This requires the use of algorithms and data structures. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Game theory is an important area of study in artificial intelligence, and the paper's focus on potential games could be relevant to AI applications. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's focus on game theory and potential games could be relevant to machine learning applications, particularly in the area of reinforcement learning. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Game theory is often used to model social and information networks, and the paper's focus on potential games could be relevant to this area of study."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
