Specifically, the focus on lexical semantic change detection and models of diachronic conceptual change suggests a strong connection to natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the applications mentioned in the abstract, such as measuring document similarity over time and information retrieval from long-term archives, suggest a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of computational models to understand semantic change also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of OCR algorithms suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
