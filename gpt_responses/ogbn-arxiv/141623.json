The use of widely-linear detection at the receiver also suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses non-cooperative games for resource allocation, which could be relevant to game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the numerical results presented in the paper involve simulations of wireless communication systems, which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
