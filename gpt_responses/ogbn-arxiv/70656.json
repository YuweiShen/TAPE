The paper proposes a new kernel function and length-scale adaptation method, which are relevant to topics such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), control systems (cs.SY), and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
