The use of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) and Part Orientation Fields (POFs) also suggests a strong computer vision focus. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves the use of a 3D deformable mesh model to represent the motion of the body, face, and fingers. This is a common technique in computer graphics for creating realistic human animations. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis and synthesis of human motion in videos, which is a key topic in multimedia research. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on 3D motion capture has potential applications in robotics, particularly in the development of humanoid robots that can mimic human movements. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper's focus on capturing human motion in the wild has implications for human-computer interaction, particularly in the development of more natural and intuitive interfaces for virtual and augmented reality applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
