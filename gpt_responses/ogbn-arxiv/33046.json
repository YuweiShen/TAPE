The paper also proposes a new neuron model for SNNs, which involves training and optimization techniques, falling under neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the accuracy and latency of SNNs, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of SNNs in low-power event-driven data analytics, which falls under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
