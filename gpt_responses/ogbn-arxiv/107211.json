The paper also proposes a formal refinement-based software development process, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The use of a common system model and syntactic development steps with a well-defined semantics for document evolution suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the focus on correctness in software development suggests the use of systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
