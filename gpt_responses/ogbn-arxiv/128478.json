This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of sparsity-inducing norms on input weights, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) for high-dimensional non-linear variable selection. Finally, the paper provides a simple geometric interpretation of the non-convex problem of addition of a new unit, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
