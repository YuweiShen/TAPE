This involves enhancing spatial reuse and actively suppressing interference towards neighboring Wi-Fi devices. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the selection of a suitable set of user equipment to be served in the unlicensed band, which involves optimizing data rates and accounting for the proximity of Wi-Fi devices. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also discusses interference rejection during an enhanced listen-before-talk (LBT) phase, which is related to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of Wi-Fi networks deployed within the coverage area of cellular base stations, which is related to the Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. However, since the paper does not explicitly discuss game theory, this sub-category is less likely than the others mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
