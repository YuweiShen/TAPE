It may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it discusses the use of distributed protocols to compute a data transfer schedule. Additionally, the paper's focus on reinforcement learning and parameter servers suggests it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of distributed computing frameworks and optimization techniques may also make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
