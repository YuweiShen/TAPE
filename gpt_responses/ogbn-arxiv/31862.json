This involves processing nodes receiving a sequence of data minibatches, computing a variational posterior for each, and making asynchronous streaming updates to a central model. The paper addresses the key challenge of finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP posterior components before performing each update, by developing a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences and providing an efficient solution technique. The paper also applies the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental results demonstrating its practical scalability and performance. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as the paper deals with developing a methodology for inference in probabilistic models using machine learning techniques, and involves optimization and algorithmic design. The sub-categories cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also possible, as the paper deals with statistical inference and distributed systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
