The use of ${(d,k)}$ input constraints and the study of constrained sequences suggest a connection to combinatorics (cs.DM) and discrete structures (cs.DS). The focus on the asymptotic behavior of codes in the large block-length limit suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC) and complexity theory (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
