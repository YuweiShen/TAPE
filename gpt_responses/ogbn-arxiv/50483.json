The use of distributed algorithms and stochastic approximation techniques suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and control systems (cs.SY). The problem formulation and estimation techniques involve mathematical analysis and optimization, indicating a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
