The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as logic-based implementation of search strategies and simulation of bounded-resource reasoning, suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses transformations of logic programs, which is a topic in mathematical logic (cs.LO). The mention of committed-choice processors suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of chain form for writing deterministic metainterpreters, which could be seen as a data structure or algorithmic technique, suggesting a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
