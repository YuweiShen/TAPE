This falls under the scope of evolutionary computing and neural networks. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an algorithm to solve a real-time dynamic problem using meta-heuristic techniques. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on multi-dimensional unconstrained benchmark test functions. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper proposes an algorithm to solve a real-time dynamic problem, which can be applied in the field of robotics for path planning. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a novel strategy to generate perturbations effectively, which can be considered as a learning process.
