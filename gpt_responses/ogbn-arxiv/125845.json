The paper also briefly discusses the implications of the findings on the field of Deep Learning, which further supports the relevance to these sub-categories. Among these sub-categories, cs.NE and cs.LG are the most likely as they directly relate to the topic of neural network training and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
