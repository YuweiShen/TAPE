The approach involves assigning scores based on geometric distribution and characteristics, which suggests the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the reduction of highly dense maps, which could involve machine learning algorithms (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the removal of transient features, which could involve natural language processing techniques for identifying and removing text-based features (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
