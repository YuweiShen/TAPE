The paper also makes use of signal processing techniques such as oversampling and decimation filter, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and mathematical analysis (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the development of a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify the time instances when breathing estimation is not possible, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and control systems (cs.SY).
