The system relies on visual servoing using a combination of a tracking marker attached to the probe and the endomicroscopy images themselves. The resulting sub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large mosaics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. The system provides intuitive visualization and fusion of the multi-scale images. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.Medical Imaging, and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
