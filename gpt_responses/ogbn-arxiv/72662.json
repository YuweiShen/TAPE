The use of unsupervised-discriminative learning approach and fine-grained datasets also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the approach to single-view reconstruction and the use of artificial data suggest the possibility of the paper belonging to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
