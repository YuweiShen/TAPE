This suggests that the paper could potentially fall under multiple sub-categories, but the most likely one is cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the focus is on improving search and retrieval of documents. The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) to extract visual and textual cues. Additionally, the use of commonsense knowledge (cs.AI) and machine learning techniques (cs.LG) are also mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
