The paper focuses on the theoretical properties of the proposed mechanism, studying its social welfare and revenue guarantee in different settings. This work falls under the intersection of game theory (cs.GT), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the use of probability distributions and sampling in the proposed mechanism suggests a potential connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
