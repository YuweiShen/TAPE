The proposed model uses attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in NLP and machine learning (ML) research. The focus on tables and their structure suggests a potential overlap with database (DB) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
