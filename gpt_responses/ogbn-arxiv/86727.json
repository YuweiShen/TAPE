Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves training a model using distant supervision and deep probabilistic logic learning, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it focuses on extracting evidence sentences from reference documents. Finally, the paper uses evidence sentences to improve the performance of MRC models, which is a task that can be studied in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
