The paper also discusses pre-training techniques, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of depth sensors and local semantic information also suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper mentions achieving better accuracy, which could involve neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
