The use of a physical data structure, a distributed triangulation of the workspace, suggests that this paper may also fall under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The development of local policies for achieving full coverage and good coverage frequency and visitation times suggests that this paper may also fall under the categories of multi-agent systems (cs.MA), distributed systems (cs.DS), and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of analytical arguments and experimental validation suggests that this paper may also fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
