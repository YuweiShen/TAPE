The focus on robotics and sequential decision making also suggests that the paper could be categorized under Robotics (cs.RO). The use of generative models and learning parameters falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The mention of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) suggests that the paper could also be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the discussion of tractable methods of learning and finding optimal policies suggests that the paper could also be categorized under Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
