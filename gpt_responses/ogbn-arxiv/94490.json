The proposed architecture is applied to the inductive node classification problem and the traffic speed forecasting problem, which are both related to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a Graph Gated Recurrent Unit (GGRU), which is a type of neural network commonly used in natural language processing and sequential data analysis (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
