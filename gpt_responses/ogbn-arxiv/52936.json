The paper also discusses the potential failures of ANNs in safety-critical systems, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of bounded model checking and symbolic verification is a technique commonly used in control systems (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG, followed by cs.SE, cs.CR, cs.SY, and cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
