It also involves the use of deep neural networks to model the review-aspect category correlation, which is a common technique in IR. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as it deals with Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) such as Facebook. The paper also involves the use of bipartite graphs, which are commonly used in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Mining (cs.DB). Finally, the paper involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis, which is a common technique in Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
