This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including information retrieval (cs.IR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), machine learning (cs.LG), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, since the paper focuses on search and retrieval, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.DS and cs.DB. The use of graph-based methods also suggests a potential connection to cs.LG, while the mention of non-metric data could be relevant to cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
