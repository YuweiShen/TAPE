The proposed solution involves sparsifying and restraining the activation value of capsules, which is related to regularization techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the potential of capsule networks as a new tool for visual tasks, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed solution involves modifying the activation values of capsules, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) in the form of analyzing the abstract and proposing a suitable regularization method, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
