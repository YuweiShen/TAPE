Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of procedural constructs, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of multi-domain texts, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
