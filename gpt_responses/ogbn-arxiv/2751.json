This suggests that the paper could belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Multimedia (cs.MM), or Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. However, since the paper focuses on LTE HetNets and proposes a solution that is standard compliant and can be implemented using Almost Blank Subframes (ABS) and Cell Selection Bias (CSB), it is most likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
