The paper also discusses the security guarantees provided by the system, which suggests that it may fall under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The system is designed to work on Intel SGX, which is a type of trusted computing device, so it may also fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance overheads of different cryptographic algorithms, which suggests that it may fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) or cyber security (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
