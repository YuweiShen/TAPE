The use of fractal structures is a novel technique for extending the range of applicability of compositions, which is a topic in discrete mathematics. The problems studied in the paper involve cuts in graphs, which is a topic in graph theory and computational geometry. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also involves some graph-theoretic and combinatorial aspects, which suggest the sub-categories cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
