This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n2. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper explicitly mentions multi-agent systems and their optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is also a distributed one, which is a common theme in multi-agent systems research.\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a decentralized continuous-time algorithm for solving the intersection computation problem. This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n4. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The paper deals with an optimization problem where each component is only known to a particular node. The proposed algorithm aims to achieve an optimal agreement within the optimal solution set of the overall optimization objective.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper uses convex and non-smooth analysis to establish several important properties of the distance functions with respect to the global optimal solution set and a class of invariant sets. This falls under the scope of numerical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
