The authors derive closed-form expressions for the energy shortage probability, which is a key performance metric in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of energy harvesting in wireless networks, which is a topic of interest in the networking and internet architecture community. The authors propose practical transmission schemes for finite-horizon and perform numerical simulations in AWGN and fading channels with no CSI available at the transmitter. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of energy shortage in communication systems with EH nodes, which can be viewed as a control problem. The authors propose transmission schemes that aim to minimise the energy shortage probability and optimise the transmission initiation threshold. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the proposed transmission schemes and performance analysis can be applied to multimedia communication in wireless networks. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not focus on cryptography and security, but the use of EH nodes in wireless networks raises security concerns, such as the possibility of energy harvesting attacks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
