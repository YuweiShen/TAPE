The use of high-performance computing is also mentioned, which could fall under the categories of modeling and simulation (cs.MS) or computer systems and networking (cs.CE). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning to connect experimental outputs and refine theory, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of these technologies on the way materials research is performed, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
