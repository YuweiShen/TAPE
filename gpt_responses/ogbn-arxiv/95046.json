The use of priorities between robots and collision-free trajectory planning also suggests the paper could be categorized under multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems and optimization (cs.SY). The proposed algorithm for trajectory planning involves satisfying kinodynamic constraints, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
