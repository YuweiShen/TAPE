This involves using segmentation and classification techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the potential clinical impact of the proposed framework, which suggests a medical application (cs.MED). Finally, the use of neural networks in the proposed method suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of cs.NEURON."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
