The proposed scheme aims to mitigate interference caused by D2D links when sharing resources with cellular users. This work involves the use of stochastic geometry to model the network, which is a common technique used in the field of network information theory (cs.IT). The paper also deals with network optimization and control, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of power control and channel allocation is a common technique in wireless communication systems (cs.NI). The paper also deals with the analysis of network performance, which involves the use of mathematical models and simulations, falling under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
