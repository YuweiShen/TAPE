This indicates a strong connection to game theory, which is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): A/B testing is commonly used in information retrieval to compare the effectiveness of different search algorithms or ranking methods. Although the paper focuses on auctions, it may still be relevant to the IR community as a methodological contribution to A/B testing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): A/B testing is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of different models or algorithms. The paper may be of interest to researchers in this area who are interested in applying A/B testing to auction settings. \n4. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): Auctions are a classic topic in the intersection of computer science and economics. The paper's focus on A/B testing of auctions may be of interest to researchers in this area who are interested in experimental methods. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Although the paper does not focus on data structures or algorithms per se, it may be of interest to researchers in this area who are interested in experimental methods or optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
