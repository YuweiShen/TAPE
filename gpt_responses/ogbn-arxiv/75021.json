The use of neural architectures for text summarization suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are often associated with the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of advanced deep learning models and large quantities of data suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
