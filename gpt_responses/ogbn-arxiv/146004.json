It may also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as secure file transfer is a crucial aspect of VANETs. Additionally, it could be categorized under Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) as the proposed scheme is fully-distributed and relies on the collaboration of cluster members. It may also fall under Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) as the paper proposes a novel algorithm for file transfer. Finally, it could be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY) as the proposed scheme involves the coordination of multiple vehicles to achieve effective file transfer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
