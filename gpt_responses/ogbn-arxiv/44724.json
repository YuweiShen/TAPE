The paper also discusses the use of interactive protocols, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper's focus on streaming algorithms and frequency moments also suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-categories of data mining (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
