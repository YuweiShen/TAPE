The paper also discusses the issue of selection bias and regularization, which are common topics in the fields of \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.CE\" (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). The paper also uses statistical methods and discusses the impact of observational data, which are relevant to the fields of \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory) and \"cs.ST\" (Statistics).
