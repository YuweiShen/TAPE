This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes two numerical algorithms for solving the CNMF model, which involves solving a nonnegative matrix factorization problem. This falls under the domain of numerical analysis.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The CNMF model has been used in the past for analyzing social and information networks, and the paper discusses its performance on real-world data. This suggests that cs.SI could be a relevant sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new algorithms for solving a matrix factorization problem, which could be of interest to researchers in the domain of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The CNMF model has been used in the past for analyzing video data, which falls under the domain of computer vision.
