The paper discusses text-based question answering using both information retrieval techniques and deep neural network approaches, which are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science. cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category as it specifically deals with natural language processing tasks such as question answering. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also likely as the paper discusses traditional information retrieval techniques for the task. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning) are relevant as the paper focuses on deep learning approaches. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also relevant as it deals with neural network models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
