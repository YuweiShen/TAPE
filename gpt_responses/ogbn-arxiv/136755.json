The paper also mentions results from classical mathematics (Hilbert and Minkowski), indicating a strong connection to logic and foundations of mathematics (cs.LO). The paper also involves combinatorial aspects (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT) in the context of weighted automata. The paper's focus on axiomatizations and equivalence of behavior suggests a connection to formal languages (cs.FL) and category theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
