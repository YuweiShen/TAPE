The paper discusses the extension of span error bound theory to weighted SVM and introduces effective hyperparameter selection methods for the algorithm. This work is related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). However, given the focus on SVM and hyperparameter selection, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
