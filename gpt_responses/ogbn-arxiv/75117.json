This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions improvements in processing subarrays, which could be relevant to the cs.PF (Performance) sub-category. The use of non-temporal memory stores could also be relevant to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper's focus on handling large amounts of data could also be relevant to the cs.DM (Data Management) sub-category. Finally, the mention of improved handling of tiny arrays could be relevant to the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
