Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of various deep learning techniques, such as residual networks and attention-based designs, which are relevant to machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of different models on various datasets, which is related to multimedia (MM) and neural networks (NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
