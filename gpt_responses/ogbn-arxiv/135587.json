The paper proposes a sparse encoding and phaseless decoding approach to solve the beam alignment problem, which involves finding a sparse sensing matrix and an efficient recovery algorithm to recover the support and magnitude of the sparse signal from compressive phaseless measurements. This approach is based on the sparse scattering nature of mmWave channels and uses a sparse bipartite graph coding (SBG-Coding) algorithm for sparse encoding and phaseless decoding. The paper provides theoretical analysis and simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
