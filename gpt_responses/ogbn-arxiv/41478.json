The paper evaluates the performance of over 35 RSIR methods ranging from traditional handcrafted feature based methods to recent, deep learning based ones. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of deep learning based approaches for RSIR, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DL (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper involves performance evaluation of RSIR methods, which could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with remote sensing imagery, which could also place it in the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
