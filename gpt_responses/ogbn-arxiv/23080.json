The paper also mentions the pure lambda calculus, which is a topic in theoretical computer science and falls under the category of logic and computation (cs.LO). The paper's focus on signatures and syntax suggests that it could also fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper's mention of compositionality and inductive/recursive principles suggests that it could also fall under formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
