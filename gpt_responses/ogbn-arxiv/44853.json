This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) such as neural networks, as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) for recommendation systems. The use of knowledge graphs also suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and potentially social networks (cs.SI) for modeling item associations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
