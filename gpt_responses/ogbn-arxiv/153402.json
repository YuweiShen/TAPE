This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as stereo matching and image aggregation. Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with 3D reconstruction, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of self-adaptive view aggregation involves learning from the data, which is a machine learning (cs.LG) technique. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for multi-view stereo reconstruction, which can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
