Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses power-domain and code-domain NOMA, which are related to information theory and communication systems, respectively, suggesting cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) as likely categories. The paper also presents a game-theoretic framework for resource management, which falls under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
