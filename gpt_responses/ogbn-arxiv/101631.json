The problem of interference avoidance in the presence of stochastic interference is addressed, which suggests a focus on networking (cs.NI) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses optimal positioning and placement algorithms, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a cost-effective method, which could involve optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
