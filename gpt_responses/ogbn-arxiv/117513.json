The use of network topologies and performance metrics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The focus on robustness and fragility of lower bounds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of worst-case lower bounds and analysis techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
