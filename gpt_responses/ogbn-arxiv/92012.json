The use of automatic algorithms for selecting the best robotic modules involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the optimization formulation of the co-design problem involves control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the need for inexpensive and disposable robots, which may involve software engineering (cs.SE) and the use of 3D printing and manufacturing may involve materials science (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
