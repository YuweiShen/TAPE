This topic is most closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new activation function that encourages convergence, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture on object recognition tasks, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
