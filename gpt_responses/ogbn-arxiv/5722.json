The paper discusses the use of machine listening techniques for recognizing individual sound sources and creating a comprehensive acoustic model of the city, which falls under the scope of cs.SD.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category is also a likely fit as the paper discusses the socio-technical solutions for addressing noise pollution and the use of citizen science methods to connect urban residents to city agencies and each other. This falls under the broader scope of the relationship between technology and society, which is the focus of cs.CY.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of a distributed network of sensors and people for large-scale noise monitoring, which falls under the scope of cs.SI. The paper also discusses the use of big data solutions to analyze and visualize information from sensors and citizens, which is another area of focus for cs.SI.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of low-cost, low-power technology for the sensors used in the SONYC project, which falls under the scope of cs.CE. The paper also discusses the use of big data solutions for analyzing and retrieving information from sensors and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
