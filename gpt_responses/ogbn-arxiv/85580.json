Additionally, the paper introduces a natural deduction calculus that adds a form of \"closed-world\" equality to deduction modulo, a framework for extending a logic with a rewriting layer operating on formulas. This connects the paper to the sub-categories of programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and logic in computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
