The most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it deals with natural language processing tasks such as information extraction. The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of linguistic knowledge, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
