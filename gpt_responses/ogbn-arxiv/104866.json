The paper proposes a new domain adaptation algorithm for learning from logged data containing outcomes from a biased recommendation policy and predicting recommendation outcomes according to random exposure. This involves techniques from causal inference, which is a subfield of machine learning that deals with understanding the causal relationships between variables. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
