The addition of contextual information to KABs is the main focus of this paper. This topic is closely related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with knowledge representation and reasoning. The paper also discusses temporal properties expressed in mu-calculus, which falls under the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The use of KBs and TBox assertions suggests that this paper could also be classified under Databases (cs.DB). The paper also discusses verification of properties, which is a topic in Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of logic and formal frameworks suggests that this paper could also be classified under Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
