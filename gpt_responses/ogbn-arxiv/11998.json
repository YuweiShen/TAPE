Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of 3D meshes, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of video footage and multi-view video suggests the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
