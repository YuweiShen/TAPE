The proposed approach involves modeling and inferring various relation patterns, which is a topic of interest in natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of negative sampling for training the model, which is a common technique in database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
