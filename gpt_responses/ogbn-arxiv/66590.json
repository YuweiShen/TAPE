The focus is on the downlink (DL) of cellular networks and the use of aggressive pilot reuse across the RRH system. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of massive MIMO and coded pilot approaches, which are relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
