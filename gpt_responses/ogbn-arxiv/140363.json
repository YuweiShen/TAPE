The paper also discusses inference techniques, which are relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and cryptography (cs.CR). The lower complexity bounds mentioned in the paper are related to computational complexity theory, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
