The paper proposes a practical spectrum sharing scheme that leverages multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology. The paper also discusses interference management techniques such as blind beamforming (BBF) and blind interference cancellation (BIC). Given the focus on wireless networks and signal processing techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
