The paper proposes a new method for online knowledge distillation with diverse peers, which is likely to fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves attention-based mechanisms, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves transfer learning, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
