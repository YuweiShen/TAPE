However, the application also incorporates cognitive capabilities to optimize the routing paths, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). Additionally, the application involves the use of control systems and optimization algorithms to improve network performance (cs.SY, cs.CR). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of information theory to reduce the monitoring overhead required for optimal path selection (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
