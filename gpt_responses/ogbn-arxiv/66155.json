Additionally, the paper mentions training very large translation and language models, which are often tackled using machine learning techniques. The paper also mentions language modeling (cs.CL) and translation (cs.CV) specifically, which are sub-categories related to natural language processing, a common application of machine learning. The paper's focus on optimization methods and convergence guarantees also suggests it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
