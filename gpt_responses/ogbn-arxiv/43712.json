The use of permanent random connectomes also suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmarks, which suggests a potential connection to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
