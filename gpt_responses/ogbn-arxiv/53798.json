It focuses on pedagogic language design and its impact on educational settings, making it likely to be categorized under cs.PL (Programming Languages). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of this design in educational settings, making it relevant to cs.ED (Education). The paper also discusses the separation of concerns and the elimination of unnecessary dependencies, which are topics relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the new design in the Pyret programming language, making it relevant to cs.CE (Computational Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
