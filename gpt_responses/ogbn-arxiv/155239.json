The paper also proposes an end-to-end learning framework, which involves training a neural network to jointly predict the pedestrian's pose and attributes, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed model on three challenging datasets, which involves extensive experimentation and analysis, making it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
