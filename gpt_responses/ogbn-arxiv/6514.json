The use of linear substitution calculus and proof-nets suggests a connection to logic and proof theory, hence the likelihood of cs.LO and cs.PL. The paper also discusses the invariance of machines and cost models, which relates to the topics of cs.TL and cs.CC. Finally, the paper presents a new form of shared normal form and shared reduction, which may have implications for data structures and algorithms, hence the likelihood of cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
