The paper focuses on both block codes and convolutional codes separately and presents necessary and sufficient conditions for an encoder in systematic form to generate a code with maximum (sum) rank distance. These topics are related to information theory (cs.IT), graph theory (cs.GT), data structures (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
