Information theory is closely related to signal processing and communication systems, and hence this category is likely.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social networks, the problem of DOA estimation can be seen as a network inference problem, where the goal is to estimate the connections between different nodes (i.e., antennas) in a network. Hence, this category is also likely.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a nonconvex optimization method for DOA estimation, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. Moreover, the iterative reweighted strategy used in the proposed method is a common technique in machine learning. Hence, this category is also likely.\n4. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the problem of DOA estimation, which is a common problem in signal processing. Moreover, the proposed method is based on sparsity metrics, which is a common technique in signal processing. Hence, this category is also likely.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes an iterative optimization method for DOA estimation, which involves solving a convex optimization problem at each iteration.
