The paper also involves analyzing the tradeoff between privacy and utility, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the estimation of continuous random variables using Gaussian perturbations, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
