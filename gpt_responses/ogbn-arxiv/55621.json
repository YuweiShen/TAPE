The paper also discusses the quantization of neural network models, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of logarithmic quantization is a novel approach that may be of interest to researchers in the field of numerical optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of compressed NMT models in devices with limited hardware capability, which may be of interest to researchers in computer vision (cs.CV) who are working on edge computing and mobile devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
