This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also discusses the use of similarity metrics and topological constraints, which are common in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of geometric shapes and area preservation, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
