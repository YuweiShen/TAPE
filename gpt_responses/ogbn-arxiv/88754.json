This involves the use of multivariate linear regression models and Monte Carlo sampling techniques. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to other methods. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and bioinformatics (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
