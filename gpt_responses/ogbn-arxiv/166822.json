The privacy constraint mentioned in the title suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of layered random binning and the study of false acceptance probability indicate that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the mention of biometric source data suggests that the paper may also be related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
