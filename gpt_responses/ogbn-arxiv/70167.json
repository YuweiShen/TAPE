The use of neural models and distant supervision also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves working with large datasets and deriving types from categories, which could be relevant to database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the use of hyperlinked mentions in Wikipedia suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
