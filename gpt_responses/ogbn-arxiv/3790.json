The models are based on natural language processing techniques, which suggests the paper could also be categorized under computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of neural networks for world creation also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves human evaluation of the generated game environments, which suggests it could be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC).
