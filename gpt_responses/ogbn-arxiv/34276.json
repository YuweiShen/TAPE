The paper also extensively discusses the use of machine learning techniques for link quality estimation, which suggests that it could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the design decisions taken in each step of the ML process, which could also classify it under systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
