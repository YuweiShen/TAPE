This is a topic closely related to logic in computer science. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a program synthesizer called SuSLik, which is a tool for software engineering. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper describes a synthesis algorithm that derives a program from a pair of assertions, which can be seen as a language recognition problem. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper reports on the experience of using SuSLik to synthesize a series of benchmark programs manipulating heap-based linked data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
