The paper also discusses optimization criteria and algorithms (cs.SI) for finding optimal index codes. The concept of minimizing the maximum probability of error among all receivers is related to game theory (cs.GT) and the simulation results involve mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
