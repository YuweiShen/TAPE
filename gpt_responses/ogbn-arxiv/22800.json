This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also proposes transmission schemes based on interference creation and resurrection, which are related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of finite symbols channel extension, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
