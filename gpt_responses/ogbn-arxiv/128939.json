The paper focuses on the theoretical understanding of VRM and provides generalization bounds for it. The topic of the paper is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, given the focus on theoretical analysis and generalization bounds, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
