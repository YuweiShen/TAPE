Specifically, the paper proposes a new deep neural architecture called SelectiveNet that integrates a reject option. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning, which is cs.LG. Additionally, the paper deals with classification and regression tasks, which are common in the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a new optimization approach for deep neural networks, which could also be relevant to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
