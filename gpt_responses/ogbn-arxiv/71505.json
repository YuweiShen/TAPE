The paper deals with multi-hop question answering, which involves retrieving and composing information from a large corpus. This falls under the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the system must retrieve relevant facts from the corpus. Neural networks (cs.NE) may also be applicable as the paper discusses the use of language models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
