This is a key topic in computational complexity theory.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper uses a crossover gadget to extend lower bounds to planar graphs of bounded cutwidth or treewidth. This technique is commonly used in computational geometry to prove lower bounds for geometric algorithms.\n4. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper studies combinatorial problems on graphs, which is a topic in discrete mathematics. The use of treewidth and cutwidth as graph parameters also relates to the study of graph minors and graph decompositions, which are important topics in this sub-category.\n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper deals with the complexity of solving Independent Set and Dominating Set, which are classic problems in game theory.
