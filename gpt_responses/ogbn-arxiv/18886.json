The use of approximation algorithms and fixed-parameter algorithms also points towards cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper discusses kernelization complexity, which is a topic often studied in cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
