The paper also proposes a novel training strategy for GANs and a referenceless quality metric, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.MM, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the inpainting of dis-occluded regions, which falls under graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper proposes a method for capturing local distortions and their impact on perceptual quality, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
