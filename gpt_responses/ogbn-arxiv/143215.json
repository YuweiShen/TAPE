It also discusses complexity constraints and tricomplexity classes, which are related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the extraction of solutions from proofs, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses parameterized/schematic versions of the theory, which could be related to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
