The paper proposes a scalable probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm that incorporates graph-based priors to improve prediction accuracy. The paper also discusses the identification and removal of contested edges in the graph, which is a common problem in graph-based methods. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
