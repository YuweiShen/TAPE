The paper proposes a new network architecture and a novel residual unit, which are both related to the optimization of deep neural networks (cs.LG). The gradual increase of feature map dimension at all units is a technique that can potentially improve the convergence and generalization ability of neural networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve benchmark datasets and classification accuracy, which are common topics in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
