It proposes the use of micro-services (MS) application architecture to tackle this problem. The paper also addresses the problem of scheduling micro-services across multiple clouds, including micro-clouds, while considering different user-level SLAs. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
