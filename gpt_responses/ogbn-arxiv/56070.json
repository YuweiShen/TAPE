Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also focuses on wireless communication systems, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper deals with the implementation of radio systems, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions the use of antennas, which could suggest the category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with the issue of self-interference, which could fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
