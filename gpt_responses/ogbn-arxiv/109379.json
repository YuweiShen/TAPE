This problem is related to several areas of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), statistical inference (cs.SI), data mining (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of mutual information and sparse signal models also suggests a connection to compressive sensing (cs.IT, cs.DS, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
