The paper also mentions the use of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an accuracy measure, which is a common metric used in information theory (cs.IT) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the automatic selection of the best compression algorithm, which involves optimization and decision-making, topics commonly studied in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
