It involves the development of a framework consisting of distributed functional entities managed within a policy-based infrastructure to provide QoS and resource management in converged networks. The paper also discusses the implementation and analysis of various measurement-based admission control schemes developed within a Java-based prototype of the policy-based framework. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
