The paper also uses convex analysis, which is a common tool in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel iterative algorithm, which could be of interest to researchers in the systems and control (cs.SI) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
