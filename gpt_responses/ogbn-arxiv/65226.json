This problem is related to compressed sensing and signal processing, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing). The paper also proposes a new algorithm called SOMP-NS, which involves weighting the impact of each measurement vector on the choice of atoms to be picked according to their noise levels. This algorithm is based on the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for sparse signal recovery. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning) as well. Additionally, the paper involves numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which may fall under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
