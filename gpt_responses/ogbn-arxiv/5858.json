Additionally, the paper proposes a novel loss function that improves the generalization capability of a classifier, which is a common topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions experiments on verification tasks, which suggests that it may also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper's title mentions \"Max Margin\" and \"Gaussian Affinity\", which are concepts related to optimization and probability, respectively, suggesting that it may also belong to the Mathematical Modeling (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
