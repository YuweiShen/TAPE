The proposed method involves learning to enhance each proposal's feature via modeling semantic and spatio-temporal relationships among object proposals, which requires machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The experiments are carried out on the ImageNet VID dataset, which is a common benchmark dataset for object detection in videos (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed method can potentially be applied to robotics applications, such as object detection for autonomous vehicles (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
