This aligns with the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The use of deep learning also suggests the paper could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the emphasis on extending the operating envelope to include GNSS-less conditions aligns with the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
