The proposed framework involves the use of graph neural networks and estimation functions, which are commonly used in the subfields of machine learning such as deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
