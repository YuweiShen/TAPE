Therefore, it is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach for house price prediction using MTL, which is a popular machine learning technique. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses a diverse range of location data sources to capture a fine-grained location profile, which can be considered as a form of information retrieval. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with real-world house transaction data collected in Melbourne, Australia, which involves data management and processing. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for house price prediction using MTL. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses location data sources to capture a suburb profile based on census data, which can be considered as a form of social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
