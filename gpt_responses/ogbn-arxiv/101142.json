The paper uses an MDP formulation with action-dependent stochasticity, which is a common approach in robotics planning and control. The paper also proposes an approximate online solution to the MDP, which is a common approach in robotics to handle the high-dimensional and continuous state and action spaces. The paper uses a trajectory optimizer with a deterministic model to suggest promising actions to the MDP, which is a common approach in robotics to reduce computation time spent on evaluating different actions. The paper conducts experiments in simulation and on a real robotic system, which is a common approach in robotics to validate the proposed approach. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with uncertainty and vision-based perception, which are common topics in cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
