The proposed model uses a Regressive Convolution Neural Network (RCNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are commonly used in the field of deep learning and neural networks (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of insufficient training data and high computational cost, which are common issues in the field of neural networks and machine learning (cs.AI). The use of SVR also suggests the involvement of optimization and numerical methods (cs.NE). The paper also involves data analysis and feature extraction, which can be categorized under the subfield of statistical learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the evaluation of the proposed model using metrics such as MSE, MAPE, and CV-RMSE, which are commonly used in the field of data science and machine learning (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
