Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of suitable fitness functions and reward criteria, which is a topic related to reinforcement learning, making cs.LG (Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category.
