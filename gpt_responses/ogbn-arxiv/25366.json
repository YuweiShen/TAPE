The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of GRBMs and proposes several training recipes, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the failure of the training algorithm, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.NE, cs.AI, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
