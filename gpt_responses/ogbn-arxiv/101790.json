The paper proposes a novel method called the variational template machine (VTM) to generate text descriptions from data tables. This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The method also involves learning templates from both paired and non-paired data, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper uses datasets from different domains, which could also fall under the category of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
