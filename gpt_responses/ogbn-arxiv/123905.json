Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses control theory and a closed-loop control system, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper mentions performance evaluation, which could indicate that it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
