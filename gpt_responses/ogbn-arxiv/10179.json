It could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as the end-to-end performance of a text recognition system is of interest to users of automatic information retrieval pipelines. Additionally, it could be classified under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it deals with text recognition. The paper also proposes a measure that can be configured to penalize different reading orders, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the evaluation of a system's performance, which could also fall under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
