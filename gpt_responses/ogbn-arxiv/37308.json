The focus on decomposing proofs and propositions into more atomic ones suggests that the paper may belong to the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The mention of propositional logic, linear logic, deep inference, equational logic, and explicit substitution calculi suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL), as these are all systems that have been used to design programming languages. The mention of axiomatic theories, modal logics, and type theories suggests that the paper may belong to the category of Information Theory (cs.IT), as these are all areas that deal with the representation and manipulation of information. The mention of integrating theories into proof theory suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), as this is an area that deals with the organization and manipulation of data. Finally, the mention of research groups working on integrating theories into proof theory suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE), as this is an area that deals with the design and development of software systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
