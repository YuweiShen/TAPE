This approach is particularly useful for exploring input space without relying on static or symbolic reasoning about program semantics, which is challenging for numerical code. Therefore, the paper is likely to be categorized under software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), logic in computer science (cs.LO), numerical analysis (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
