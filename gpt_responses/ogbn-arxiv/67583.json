The paper also draws inspiration from the domain of cyber forensics, which indicates a possible connection to the cs.CR category. The proposed taxonomy of subfields suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the discussion on foundational challenges suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
