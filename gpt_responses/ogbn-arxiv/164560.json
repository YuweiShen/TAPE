The paper covers a wide range of topics from software to hardware, circuit level to system level, which suggests that it could fit into any of these categories. However, given the focus on neural network inference and its applications in image, speech, and video recognition, cs.AR and cs.CV are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
