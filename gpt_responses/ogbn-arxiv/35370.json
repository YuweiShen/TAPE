The paper proposes a novel approach that can handle non-linear kernels and missing rows and columns, and shows improved performance on both simulated and real-world data. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), signal processing (cs.SI), and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
