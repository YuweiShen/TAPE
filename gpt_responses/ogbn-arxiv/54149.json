It also involves deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, suggests that it may also belong to the data science (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the application of the method to left-ventricle segmentation of cardiac MR images suggests that it may also belong to the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
