The paper discusses a method for reusing information from previously learned tasks to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning agents. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
