The paper also introduces a new functionality for comparing images, which involves modeling prominent differences, and builds a model trained on relative attribute features. This involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning and decision trees, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also tests its model on two datasets, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
