The study also considers the implications and system-level aspects of pedestrian evacuation, which could fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper's focus on the features and techniques of pedestrian evacuation models could relate to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
