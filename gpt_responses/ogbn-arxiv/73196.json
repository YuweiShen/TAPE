Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the use of monomials and their order in generating polar codes, which relates to topics in discrete mathematics and algebraic geometry, making cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the permutation group and counting of minimum weight codewords, which are topics in combinatorics and computational complexity, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
