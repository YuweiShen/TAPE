The use of graph-theoretic concepts suggests a possible fit with the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The mention of achievability schemes and outer-bounds suggests a possible fit with the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of comparing results to previous work suggests a possible fit with the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
