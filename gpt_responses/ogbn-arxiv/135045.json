The use of the Kalman filter and other statistical methods suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MA) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The application of the results to demand dispatch for power grids suggests that the paper may also belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NE) sub-category.
