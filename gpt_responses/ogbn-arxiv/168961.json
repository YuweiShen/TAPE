The paper also mentions model checking, which is a topic in formal methods and verification (cs.LO). The use of summary flow functions and interprocedural analysis suggests a focus on program analysis and optimization (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the technique, which is relevant to computer systems and architecture (cs.AR) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the use of placeholders and multiple call-specific summary flow functions, which suggests a focus on software engineering and programming languages (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
