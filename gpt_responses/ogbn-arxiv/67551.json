The paper proposes a method for modifying the weights of the network to remove information about a particular set of training data, without requiring retraining or access to the original data. This topic is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given the focus on deep neural networks and the use of stochastic gradient descent, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
