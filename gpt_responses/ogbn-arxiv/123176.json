This falls under the scope of social networks (cs.SOC) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of temporal bipartite networks and centrality measures also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the evaluation of prediction methods indicates a possible connection to computational social science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
