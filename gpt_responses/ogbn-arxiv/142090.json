This is a central challenge in most areas of scientific research, particularly in connection to current major limitations of influential topics and methods of machine and deep learning as they have often lost sight of the model component. The paper introduces a parameter-free model-based approach based upon the seminal concept of Algorithmic Probability that decomposes an observation and signal into its most likely algorithmic generative mechanisms. The paper uses a causal calculus to infer model representations and demonstrates the method's ability to distinguish interacting mechanisms and deconvolve them, regardless of whether the objects produce strings, space-time evolution diagrams, images, or networks. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
