Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of tactics and automation, which are common topics in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed method, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
