The paper uses ray tracing simulations to study the behavior of AG mmWave bands at two different frequencies: 28~GHz and 60~GHz. The received signal strength (RSS) and root mean square delay spread (RMS-DS) of multipath components (MPCs) are analyzed for different UAV heights considering four different environments: urban, suburban, rural, and over sea. This work involves the use of wireless communication, signal processing, and robotics, which are the main areas of research in cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.RO, cs.MA, and cs.SY. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
