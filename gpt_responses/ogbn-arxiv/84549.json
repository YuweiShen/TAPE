The paper also mentions distributed hash tables and logging schemes, which are commonly studied in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) and virtualized global address space suggests that the paper could also belong to the Architecture (cs.AR) and Operating Systems (cs.OS) sub-categories.
