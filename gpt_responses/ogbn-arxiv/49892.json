This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also focuses on improving the accuracy of gaze estimation for human-computer interaction (cs.HC) applications. The use of deep learning models for estimation also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a calibration method for improving estimation accuracy, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
