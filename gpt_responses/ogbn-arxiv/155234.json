The proposed method is tested on simulated robotic locomotion, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The experiments also include Atari game playing, which involves computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the balance between sample complexity and simplicity, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
