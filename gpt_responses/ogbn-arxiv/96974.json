The tool uses systematic input generation strategies informed by static and dynamic analyses, which could also fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and software development (cs.SD) categories. The tool's primary goal is to trigger crashes, which falls under the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) category. Finally, the tool aims to better support developers in mobile testing tasks, which could also fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
