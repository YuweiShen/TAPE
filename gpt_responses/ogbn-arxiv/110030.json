The paper does not focus on a specific sub-category of computer science, but rather applies the methods to a diverse set of research disciplines. However, based on the methods used (such as heuristics and real-time submission screening), the following sub-categories are likely to be the most relevant: \n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): Plagiarism detection is a topic that falls under the broader category of ethical and social issues in computing, which is a key focus of cs.CY. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper describes methods for efficiently detecting problematic author behaviors, which is a key aspect of information retrieval. \n- cs.DL (Digital Libraries): The paper deals with a large-scale collection of research documents, which is a key focus of digital libraries research. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the use of heuristics to reduce false positives, which is a common approach in natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper describes methods for efficiently processing and analyzing a large collection of documents, which is a key focus of database research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
