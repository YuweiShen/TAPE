The paper focuses on the social meaning of DL models and the gap between technical meanings and social meanings. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the need for interdisciplinary collaboration among AI and the Social Sciences researchers, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also touches upon the ethical and societal implications of XAI, which could place it in the category of cs.CY (Computers and Society). Finally, the paper discusses the values guiding the participants' scientific interests and conduct, which could place it in the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
