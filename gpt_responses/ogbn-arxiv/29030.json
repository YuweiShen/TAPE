This involves separating the causal and anticausal components of the signal, which is similar to the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT) decomposition. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SD) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves speech analysis and separation of non-linearly combined signals, which could also fall under the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Sound and Music Computing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the speed advantage of the complex cepstrum-based approach, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Overall, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD, followed by cs.CL, cs.SI, cs.LG, and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
