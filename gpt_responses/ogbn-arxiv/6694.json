Information theory concepts such as spectral efficiency and throughput are used to analyze the performance of the system. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a relay probing strategy for device-to-device (D2D) and device-to-network relaying in mmWave cellular systems. The focus is on improving connectivity and range in such systems. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with mmWave cellular systems, which are used for high-bandwidth multimedia applications. The use of relays is proposed to improve connectivity and range in such systems. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a relay probing strategy for mmWave cellular systems, which involves making decisions based on the current state of the system. Control theory concepts such as fixed point equations are used to analyze the system. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal with social or ethical issues related to computing, but it does propose a strategy that could potentially improve the user experience of mmWave cellular systems, which are becoming increasingly important in modern society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
