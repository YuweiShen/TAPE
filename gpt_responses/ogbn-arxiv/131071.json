The paper focuses on improving the performance of the classifier by incorporating additional structured sparsity priors based on exploiting the spatial dependences between the neighboring pixels, the inherent structure of the dictionary, or both. This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
