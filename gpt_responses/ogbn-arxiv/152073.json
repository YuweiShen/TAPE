The paper also discusses the automation of feature engineering, which is a common topic in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of neural architecture search (NAS) is another important aspect of the paper, which falls under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of complex-valued DAS, which is a specialized technique for PolSAR images and may fall under the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
