It involves detecting arbitrary changes to the model, which is related to security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.LG) topics. The proposed methodology uses transformed inputs to make the model outputs sensitive to the model's parameters, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) topics. Finally, the paper also discusses the low overhead of the proposed methodology, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) topics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
