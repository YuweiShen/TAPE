This falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also involves the use of information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC) in designing the protocols. The use of an untrusted third party and interlocking systems suggests a possible connection to distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the quantum version of the problem, which could potentially fall under the category of quantum computing (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
