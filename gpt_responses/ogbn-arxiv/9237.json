The paper also proposes a new transmission framework, which involves compressing subspaces, and this is a technique used in signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with antenna configurations, which is a topic in multiple antenna systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
