Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which includes papers on natural language processing and machine translation. The paper also proposes a novel technique that combines back-translation and multilingual NMT, which involves training a single model for both directions of a language pair. This suggests that the paper could also belong to categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which cover topics related to deep learning and neural networks. Additionally, the paper mentions reducing training and deployment costs, which could place it in categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which also deal with optimization and efficiency in machine learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
