The paper also considers the use of a monotone threshold policy, which is a common technique in control theory (cs.SY). The paper uses optimization techniques to find the optimal policy, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and operations research (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
