The use of block Markov encoding and capacity-distortion function suggests a focus on source coding and compression, which are subfields of information theory. The incorporation of side information at the decoder also suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of rate-splitting and the extension to causal channel state information suggest a possible connection to networking (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
