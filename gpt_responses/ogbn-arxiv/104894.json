The problem of orthogonal vectors is also related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM), as it involves vectors in high-dimensional spaces. Finally, the paper uses information theory techniques to prove its results, which suggests a connection to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
