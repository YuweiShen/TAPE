Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, particularly in the second stage of their approach, where they use a document-level entity linking model. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, as they construct a high recall list of candidate entities for each mention in an unlabeled document. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nFinally, the paper involves working with Wikipedia, which is a large-scale knowledge base. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.DB (Databases), which deals with the storage, retrieval, and management of large-scale data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
