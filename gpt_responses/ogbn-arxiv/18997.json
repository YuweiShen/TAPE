This makes it highly likely to belong to the cs.CV sub-category.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper discusses the decoding of visemes into spoken sounds, which involves natural language processing. This makes it a possible fit for the cs.CL sub-category.\n3. cs.SD (Sound) - Although the paper primarily deals with the visual speech signal, it also involves understanding spoken sounds. This makes it a possible fit for the cs.SD sub-category.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper has applications beyond machine lipreading, including speech therapy and psychology. This makes it a possible fit for the cs.HC sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper involves analyzing and understanding visual and audio signals, which makes it a possible fit for the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
