Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also involves optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of massive MIMO and antenna arrays suggests a possible fit with cs.MM (Multimedia), while the consideration of interference could also relate to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
