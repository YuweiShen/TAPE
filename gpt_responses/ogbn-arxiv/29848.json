The paper also introduces an AI research platform for benchmarking algorithm-hardware performance, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The platform is designed to evaluate the performance and energy efficiency of RL policies on a variety of hardware platforms, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of quality-of-flight (QoF) metrics to evaluate the trained policies, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of hardware choices on the performance of the aerial robot, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
