The paper also considers the impact of fading on the channel, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The optimization problem involves maximizing the ergodic sum-rate, which is a performance metric commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
