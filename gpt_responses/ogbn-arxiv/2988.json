This involves using the k-nearest neighbor graph of one sample set in the joint data set to estimate the divergence measures. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
