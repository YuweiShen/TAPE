The paper also introduces heteroscedasticity to generate powerful trajectory priors better suited for collision avoidance in motion planning problems. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
