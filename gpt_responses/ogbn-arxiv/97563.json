The focus is on reducing the feedback rate, which is a key issue in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a technique to improve the quality of the channel estimate, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas at each receiver is a common technique in signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of the feedback reduction technique on system performance, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
