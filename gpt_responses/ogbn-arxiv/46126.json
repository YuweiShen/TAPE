This topic falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) to capture movement data and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to develop the control algorithms. Finally, the paper discusses the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect of the training process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
