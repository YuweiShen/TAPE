The approach proposed in the paper involves using neural networks for perception and state estimation (cs.CV, cs.AI), as well as optimizing contact locations while taking dynamics into account (cs.SY). The paper also presents experiments on the task of planar pushing, which is a common task in the field of robotics and computer vision (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
