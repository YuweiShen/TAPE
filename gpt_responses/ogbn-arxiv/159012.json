The use of LDPC codes also suggests a possible fit with the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Additionally, the adaptation of existing techniques for iterative multiuser detection suggests a possible fit with the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
