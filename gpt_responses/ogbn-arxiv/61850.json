The paper proposes a quantize-and-forward (QF) relay strategy that achieves an asymptotically sum-capacity-achieving rate region for the MIMO broadcast channel with a common multiple-antenna relay. The paper also introduces the concept of cross-deterministic relation and uses it to design an asymptotically optimal relay quantizer. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a three-stage dirty paper coding strategy, along with receiver beamforming and quantization at the relay, to achieve the extended achievable rate region. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the design of a relay strategy that achieves an asymptotically sum-capacity-achieving rate region for a MIMO broadcast channel with a common multiple-antenna relay. This involves the use of quantization and dirty paper coding, which are key topics in information theory. \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a communication system involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, relays, and quantization. This is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture, especially in the context of wireless networks. \n\n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
