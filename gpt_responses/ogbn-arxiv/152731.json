This is a common topic in computer graphics.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of the proposed representation for design and analysis of physical systems, which falls under the scope of computational engineering.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper mentions the representation's ability to capture local physical constraints and global multi-scale properties, which is relevant to mechanical engineering.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper introduces a new discrete representation for shape and structure, which is a topic of interest in computational geometry.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper's focus on shape and structure modeling could also be relevant to multimedia applications such as 3D modeling and animation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
