The paper also mentions tensor factorization models, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of taxonomic information and knowledge graph completion methods are related to database systems (cs.DB) and natural language processing (cs.CL), respectively. Finally, the paper mentions experimental results on public knowledge graphs, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
