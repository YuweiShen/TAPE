This topic is closely related to Information Theory (cs.IT), as it involves the use of information to optimize the sensing strategy. It also falls under the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), as it deals with the design of a network protocol for CR networks. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of conventional sensing techniques and proposes a new approach, which is a key aspect of Cybersecurity (cs.CR). The use of CSI to adapt the sensing threshold and improve network performance is also related to Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), as it involves the use of feedback control and machine learning techniques to optimize the sensing strategy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
