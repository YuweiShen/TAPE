The proposed method also utilizes autoencoder approach to extract the latent essence of feature information. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on developing a recommendation system that utilizes user and item features to provide recommendations in multiple domains. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to cross-domain recommendations that utilizes deep learning techniques. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of cross-domain recommendations, which is a common problem in social and information networks. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper utilizes natural language processing techniques to process textual information of items in the recommendation system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
