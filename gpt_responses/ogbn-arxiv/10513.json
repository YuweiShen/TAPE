This topic is closely related to digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of data on population and GDP to model worldwide basic research, which could fall under the categories of computational social science (cs.CY) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of the digital library on astronomical research, which could be relevant to computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CR) in terms of measuring the utility time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
