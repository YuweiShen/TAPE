The use of variational formulas and the Legendre transform suggests a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), which is a concept in statistics and probability theory, making sub-categories such as cs.ST and cs.MS relevant. Finally, the mention of asymptotic and non-asymptotic expressions suggests a connection to control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
