This falls under the sub-category of Sound and Music Computing (cs.SD). The paper also discusses the use of cross-task learning and generic baseline systems, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of spatial localization, which could be relevant to Signal Processing (cs.SP) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
