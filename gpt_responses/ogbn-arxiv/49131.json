Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and channel coding, which are the main focus of this paper. \n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed system is based on deep neural networks (DNNs) for both the encoder and decoder, which are the main components of the proposed deep energy autoencoder. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for noncoherent multicarrier multiuser systems, which is based on the use of DNNs. \n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with signal processing techniques for noncoherent multicarrier multiuser systems, which are used to recover the transmitted data without any channel state information estimation. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed system can be used for multimedia applications, such as video and audio transmission, which require reliable and efficient communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
