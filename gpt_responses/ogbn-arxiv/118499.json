The use of color, texture, and length as visual features also suggests a potential connection to computer graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV). The eye tracking methodology used in the second study also suggests a connection to visual analytics and visualization (cs.VIS). Finally, the use of search tasks and benchmarking attention cost suggests a potential connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
