The paper proposes new algorithms to solve this problem, which is a common theme in machine learning research.\n- cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper mentions that the problem of contextual bandits with cross-learning arises in several strategic settings, such as learning how to bid in non-truthful repeated auctions. This suggests a connection to game theory.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a problem in machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new algorithms to solve the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning, which is a common theme in data structures and algorithms research.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions regret as a performance metric, which is a concept from information theory. Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of learning from multiple sources of information, which is a common theme in information theory research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
