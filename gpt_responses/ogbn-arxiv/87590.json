The simulations on real-world video signals suggest that the proposed method improves quantization properties, which is a topic related to computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the implications for quantization and coding, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
