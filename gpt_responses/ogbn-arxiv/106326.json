This work involves both human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.AI and cs.HC. The paper specifically focuses on text and image classifiers, which could be categorized under cs.CL and cs.CV, respectively. Finally, the paper involves a quantitative evaluation of explanations generated from a recent machine learning algorithm, which could be categorized under cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
