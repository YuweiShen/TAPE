The paper also discusses the encoding of belief change operations in dynamic epistemic logics, which is a topic related to mathematical logic (cs.LO) and logic in computer science (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of preference graphs, which is a topic related to multi-agent systems (cs.MA).
