This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, which deals with image analysis and recognition. Additionally, the paper involves collecting eye-gaze data from mobile devices, which suggests that it may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also involves developing a deep learning model, which suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category, as it involves predicting saliency in images, and the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as it deals with analyzing images in the context of mobile user interfaces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
