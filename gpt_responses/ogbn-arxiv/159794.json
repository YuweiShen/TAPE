It draws on graph theory and homomorphisms to formulate and analyze a representation based on computing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. The paper discusses both the combinatorial and empirical properties of the space of subgraph frequencies and develops frameworks for studying each of these aspects. The paper also demonstrates how the coordinate system can be used for classification tasks. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.SD (Software Development), cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
