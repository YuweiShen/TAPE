Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses deep learning-based architectures, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves data collection and annotation, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
