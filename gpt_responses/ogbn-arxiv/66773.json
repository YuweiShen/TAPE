The paper also discusses the implementation of these algorithms in a tool for type system designers, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also introduces a novel symbolic representation of programs and program states, which falls under logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the challenges of symbolically evaluating interpreters, which falls under formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses case studies on how the tool helps test and explore a variety of type systems, which falls under the area of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
