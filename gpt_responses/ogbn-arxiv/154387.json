The paper also introduces the concept of nonstandard utilities, which can be seen as a type of data structure (cs.DS) used in decision making. Finally, the paper discusses the use of qualitative decision theory, which is a subfield of mathematical analysis (cs.MA) that deals with decision making under uncertainty."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
