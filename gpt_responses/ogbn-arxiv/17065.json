This involves learning distributed representations for items in a latent space that expresses functional complementarity as well as similarity. The paper focuses on clothing and fashion verticals for evaluation purposes, but the framework is applicable across a broad set of items in the product catalog. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and machine learning. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), as the paper involves learning representations for items and making recommendations based on similarity and complementarity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
