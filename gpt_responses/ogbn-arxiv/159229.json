Additionally, it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it proposes a novel model for capturing inter-related dynamics between interacting people. The paper also involves experiments on datasets, which may make it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the proposed model may have applications in robotics (cs.RO) for human-robot interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
