The paper also proposes a modification to the standard convolution layer to improve its efficiency, which falls under the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on image datasets, which also suggests the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
