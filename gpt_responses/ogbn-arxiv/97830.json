The paper specifically focuses on the application of MEE in logistic regression, which is a popular classification algorithm used in various fields such as computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of a specially designed quantization codebook to avoid possible failure caused by the original MEE, which involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper experimentally evaluates the proposed method on public datasets, which involves statistical analysis (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
