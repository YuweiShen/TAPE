The use of neural networks for artifact segmentation and recognition accuracy improvement suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the use of real-world datasets and the focus on performance improvement suggests a possible connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
