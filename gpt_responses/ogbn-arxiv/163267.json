Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as these are all relevant to the topic of gradient estimation in SCGs. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for multi-agent learning, which suggests relevance to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
