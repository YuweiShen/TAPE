The use of text similarity metrics also suggests a connection to natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL). The development and evaluation of a supervised learning-to-rank model involves machine learning (ML) techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), which are commonly used in the subfields of machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the use of crowd-sourcing for building an expert-annotated corpus may also relate to the subfield of human-computer interaction (HCI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
