Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses an attacker model and privacy definition, which are typical topics in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of sketching algorithms and multisets suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is also a possible sub-category. The paper also analyzes the accuracy and privacy of existing algorithms, which involves information theory and machine learning concepts, making cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
