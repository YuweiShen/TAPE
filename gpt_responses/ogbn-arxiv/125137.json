The paper presents new algorithms that improve the best known time bounds among algorithms using $O(m)$ space. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), programming languages (cs.PL), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
