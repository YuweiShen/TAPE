This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with retrieval tasks on social media, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also mentions meme-style composite imagery, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper proposes a new method for accurately weighting small contributing objects within the results, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with emerging retrieval tasks, which suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
