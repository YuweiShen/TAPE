Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of cellular handover on networking performance, which falls under the category of security and privacy. Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the application breakdown and users' behaviors, which falls under the category of multimedia. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance of transport-layer protocols, which falls under the category of information theory. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the need to develop dedicated protocol mechanisms, which falls under the category of computer engineering. Therefore, cs.CE (Computer Engineering) is another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
