The use of the term \"spanning trees\" suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) may also be relevant. The paper also discusses the potential application of the results to edge-unfolding of polyhedral convex caps, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.SI (Sound and Image Processing). Finally, the paper involves some conjectures, which could potentially involve cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
