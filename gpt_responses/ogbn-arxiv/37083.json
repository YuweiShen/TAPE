The proposed framework involves the use of machine learning (cs.MM) and patch-matching (cs.CR) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of sensor noise, which falls under the category of image retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the fusion of the different tools involves the use of reliability indexes, which is related to probabilistic reasoning and decision-making (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
