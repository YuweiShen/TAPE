The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and gradient signals also indicates that it could be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the development of a nonlinear estimator, which could fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses iterative decoding, which could be relevant to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
