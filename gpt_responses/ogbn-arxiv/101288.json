The use of decision rules to capture the subspace of data where the rules are as accurate or almost as accurate as the black-box is a popular approach in this area, and it is likely that this paper would be submitted to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also discusses the use of efficient search algorithms and theoretically grounded strategies to reduce computation, which suggests that it could also be submitted to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) categories. Finally, the experiments involve structured and text data, which suggests that the paper could also be submitted to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
