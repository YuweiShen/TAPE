The paper extensively uses computer vision techniques such as Graph Convolutional Networks and spatially localized ARG. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the end-to-end learning of ARG, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to sparsify ARG, which could be related to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also evaluates its proposed method on two standard group activity recognition datasets, which could be related to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the visualization of learned actor graphs and relation features, which could be related to the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
