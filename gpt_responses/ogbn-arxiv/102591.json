This involves training a model to output appropriate classification weight vectors for novel and base classes. The paper uses ImageNet based few-shot benchmarks for evaluation, which suggests that it falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
