The paper discusses the interaction between the robot and the workpiece, which causes essential elastic deflections of the manipulator components that should be compensated by the robot controller using relevant elastostatic model of this mechanism. \n2. cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper deals with the identification of manipulator elastostatic parameters, which is a key aspect of mechanical engineering. The paper discusses the use of an advanced calibration technique based on the non-linear experiment design theory, which is adopted for this particular application. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of a relevant elastostatic model of the robot mechanism to compensate for the elastic deflections of the manipulator components. This involves the use of control techniques to ensure that the robot operates accurately and precisely. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of numerical routines to generate an optimal set of manipulator configurations and corresponding forces/torques for a given number of calibration experiments. This involves the use of computational techniques to optimize the calibration process. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss computer vision or pattern recognition,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
