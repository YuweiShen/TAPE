Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of residual CNNs and feedback control, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with visual perception quality, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses theoretical investigations and convergence, which are related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
