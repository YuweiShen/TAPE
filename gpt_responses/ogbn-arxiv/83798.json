The use of deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the study investigates how ConvNets represent spectral features, which could fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
