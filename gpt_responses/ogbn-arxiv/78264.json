The use of Compressive Sensing techniques also suggests a connection to this sub-category.\n2. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper is primarily concerned with signal processing, specifically the recovery of clipped signals. This sub-category is therefore a likely fit.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): While the paper does not explicitly deal with social or information networks, the use of Compressive Sensing techniques suggests a possible connection to this sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of algorithms such as Reweighted $\\ell_1$ minimization and Trivial Pursuit suggests a connection to machine learning, which is a common topic in this sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with signals, which are a common topic in multimedia.
