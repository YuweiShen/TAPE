The paper discusses the use of deep learning and provides a unifying Estimator interface, making it possible to write downstream infrastructure independent of the model implementation. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Natural Language Processing (cs.CL), and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
