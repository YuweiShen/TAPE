The PhaseLift approach is a popular method for solving this problem, and the paper provides explicit frames that enable the recovery of signals up to a phase using this approach. This makes cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely category, as it deals with the mathematical foundations of signal processing. \n\nThe paper also mentions the recovery of positive semidefinite matrices, which is a problem in computer vision and machine learning. This makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely categories. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of linear measurements, which is a topic in numerical analysis and optimization. This makes cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a likely category. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the theoretical analysis of the PhaseLift approach, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory.
