This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The use of multiple antennas for macrodiversity also suggests the possibility of research in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the evaluation of system capacity, which is a topic in communication theory (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
