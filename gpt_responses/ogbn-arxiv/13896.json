The paper also proposes a new module for deep networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve image and video data, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the computation cost of the proposed method, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
