The paper introduces a new type of dependency, st-SO dependencies, which are similar to second-order tgds but allow equations in the conclusion. This is a topic that falls under the scope of database theory and logic, which are covered by the cs.DB and cs.LO categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the expressive power and computational complexity of st-SO dependencies, which are topics that are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper also deals with the composition of schema mappings, which is a topic that is related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
