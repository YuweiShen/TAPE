Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also introduces three cloze-style tasks that require models to predict narrative and character-centric aspects of a panel given context, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves analyzing a large dataset of comic book panels, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
