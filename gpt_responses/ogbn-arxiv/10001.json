The paper proposes a hybrid query called an SK query and introduces a structural index to efficiently answer these queries. This work involves database systems (cs.DB) as it deals with RDF graphs, information retrieval (cs.IR) as it discusses keyword search, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a novel integrated query algorithm, deep learning (cs.DL) as it may involve neural networks for query processing, and software engineering (cs.SE) as it evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
