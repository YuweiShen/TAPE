This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The approach also involves attention maps and convolutional layers, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the application of the approach is in human-computer interaction (cs.HC), as it aims to improve the detection of facial expressions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
