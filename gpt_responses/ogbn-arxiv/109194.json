The focus of the paper is on Bayesian neural networks and their ability to quantify uncertainty in molecular property prediction. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational engineering (cs.CE), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
