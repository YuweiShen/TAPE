This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper proposes a novel linearization technique to simplify the channel model. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Full duplex radios have applications in wireless networking, and the paper proposes low-complexity designs for self-interference cancellation. This could be of interest to researchers in the networking and internet architecture community. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a model for the self-interference channel in full duplex radios, which could be of interest to researchers in the systems and control community. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): Full duplex radios could be used for multimedia applications such as video conferencing, and the paper proposes a technique for cancelling self-interference that could improve the quality of such applications. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Full duplex radios could be vulnerable to attacks that exploit self-interference, and the paper proposes a technique for cancelling self-interference that could improve the security of such radios."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
