The use of neural approaches and large datasets also suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for summarisation, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a likely sub-category. The use of machine learning models and large datasets also suggests a focus on cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
