The paper also mentions the use of program slicing, which is a technique used in programming languages (cs.PL). The paper describes the model of the hardware as a product of timed automata, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR) and embedded systems (cs.EM). Finally, the paper presents a methodology to compare computed results to actual execution times measured on a real platform, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
