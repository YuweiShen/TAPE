It incorporates knowledge of the agents' social network in the truth discovery framework and develops Laplace variational inference methods to estimate agents' reliabilities, communities, and the event states. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Sociology (cs.SOC), and Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
