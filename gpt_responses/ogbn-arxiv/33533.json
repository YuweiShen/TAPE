The authors also introduce a novel algorithm for learning with structural information modeled as convex constraints, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of customer reviews to provide users with relevant information, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for platforms to engage users to deviate from their preferred choice, which involves social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of incentives to increase exploration on the platform, which involves economics and computation (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
