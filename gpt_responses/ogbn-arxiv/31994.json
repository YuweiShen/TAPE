This makes it relevant to the area of logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper introduces a new type theory with a `later' modality and clock quantifiers for programming with guarded recursive and coinductive types. This makes it relevant to the area of programming languages.\n- cs.TL (Programming Languages): The paper presents a type theory with a `later' modality and clock quantifiers for programming with guarded recursive and coinductive types. This makes it relevant to the area of programming languages.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a type theory for programming and proving with guarded recursive and coinductive types, which can be useful for software engineering applications.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not directly relate to machine learning, the use of novel type and term formers involving delayed substitutions could potentially be relevant to the area of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
