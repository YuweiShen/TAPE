The paper also involves training a dedicated OOD model, which involves machine learning techniques and could fall under the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach, which could involve performance metrics and statistical analysis, potentially falling under the cs.CR sub-category. Finally, the paper involves training on large datasets and could involve the use of neural networks, which could fall under the cs.NE sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
