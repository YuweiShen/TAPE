The use of joint shape and appearance models and the modeling of self-occlusions and dis-occlusions suggest that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of optimization and the introduction of a novel Riemannian manifold suggest that the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The use of video and radiance suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of optimization and the introduction of a novel metric suggest that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
