Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also a possibility as the paper deals with selecting the most appropriate EREL region. Multimedia (cs.MM) is another possibility as the paper deals with image processing. Machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible categories as the paper proposes a selection strategy that outperforms the current state-of-the-art."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
