Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to find similar articles, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of machine learning techniques for processing literature dissemination suggests that cs.DL (Deep Learning) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the analysis of large amounts of data, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
