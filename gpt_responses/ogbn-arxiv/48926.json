The use of sets of probabilities also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on axiomatic accounts and mathematical foundations may also place it in the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
