The use of detectors and algorithms to solve these problems involves optimization and machine learning techniques, which are also relevant to the cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper also discusses experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, which are typical of the cs.GR (Graphics) sub-category.
