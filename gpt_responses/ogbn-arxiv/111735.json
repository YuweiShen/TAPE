It involves linear capabilities, which are a concept from programming language theory. \n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a technique for managing the lifetimes of Rust data in JavaScript, which is relevant to software engineering. It also discusses the challenges of interfacing between two different languages, which is a common problem in software engineering. \n\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses linear capabilities, which are a concept from linear logic, a subfield of logic in computer science. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with memory management, which is a fundamental aspect of computer systems. It also discusses the interface between two different systems, Rust and JavaScript. \n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a technique for managing the lifetimes of Rust data in JavaScript, which could be relevant to distributed computing. It also discusses the challenges of interfacing between two different systems, which is a common problem in distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
