The paper proposes a new method for spreading labels using higher-order structures in graphs, which involves analyzing the relationships between vertices and edges. This falls under the category of graph theory and algorithms, which is covered by cs.GR. However, the paper also involves machine learning techniques and applications, which are covered by cs.LG and cs.AI. Additionally, the paper deals with data structures and algorithms for processing large graphs, which is covered by cs.DS. Finally, the paper discusses the use of higher-order structures in graphs, which is a topic of interest in the field of social networks and information retrieval, which is covered by cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
