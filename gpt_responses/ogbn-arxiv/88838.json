The problem formulation and optimization techniques involve system-level considerations and control theory, which fall under the systems and control (SY) category. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is related to machine learning (MM) and optimization (LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
