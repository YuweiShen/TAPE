The paper specifically focuses on text classification datasets, which suggests that it may fall under the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL) or information retrieval (cs.IR). However, the proposed technique can be applied to any type of data, so it could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Given that the paper is primarily concerned with improving the credibility of deep neural networks, it is most likely to be classified under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
