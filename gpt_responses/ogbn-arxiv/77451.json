These topics are commonly studied in the sub-categories of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Computational Geometry (cs.CG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Graph Theory (cs.GT), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Given the focus on graph theory and the specific topics addressed in the paper, these five sub-categories are the most likely candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
