The use of soft-biometrics and templates also suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed approach involves representing face templates in a negative domain, which could involve machine learning techniques such as generative models (cs.LG) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
