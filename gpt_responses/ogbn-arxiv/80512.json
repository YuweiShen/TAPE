The paper also discusses the use of adversarial learning (cs.AI) and multi-scale discriminators (cs.MM) to improve the performance of the proposed model. Finally, the paper presents extensive experiments and benchmarks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which is a common practice in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
