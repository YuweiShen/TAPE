The paper also discusses the physical storage models used in the system, which is a common topic in database research.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Entity linking is also an important task in information retrieval, as it helps to identify relevant information from different sources. The paper mentions that the system can link mentioned-entities extracted from text data, which is a common task in information retrieval.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Entity linking is a task that is often tackled using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, which are common topics in AI research.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions that the system can handle multiple values for an attribute or a relationship, which is a common problem in natural language processing when dealing with entities that have multiple aliases or names.\n- cs.DL (Machine Learning): As mentioned earlier, entity linking is often tackled using machine learning techniques, which makes this category a likely fit for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
