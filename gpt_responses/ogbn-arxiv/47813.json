The evaluation of saliency models involves human perception and cognition, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop and evaluate saliency models suggests the relevance of cs.AI. The availability of image and video datasets for evaluating saliency models relates to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposal of a new evaluation framework involves statistical analysis and machine learning, which are topics covered in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
