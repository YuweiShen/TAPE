This falls under the domain of AI and machine learning. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep reinforcement learning to train the proposed algorithm, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper proposes a distributed algorithm for multi-hop ride-sharing, which involves multiple agents (i.e., vehicles and customers) interacting with each other. This falls under the domain of multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm for optimizing the dispatch and matching decisions of ride-sharing vehicles, which can be seen as a control problem.
