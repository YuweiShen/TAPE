Specifically, the paper focuses on quadratic neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also includes empirical demonstrations, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
