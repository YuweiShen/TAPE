This problem is primarily related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves developing an algorithm that can learn from noisy training data and make accurate predictions. The paper also discusses the use of crowd annotators for collecting training data, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the proposed approach involves fine-tuning with noisy relative constraints, which is related to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
