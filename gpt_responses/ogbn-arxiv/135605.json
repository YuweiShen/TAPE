The proposed method involves encoding and quantization, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the use of FPGA and ASIC for efficient implementation suggests a possible connection to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
