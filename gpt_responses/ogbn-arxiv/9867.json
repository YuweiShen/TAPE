The paper proposes a novel Kronecker Product Matching module to match feature maps of different persons in an end-to-end trainable deep neural network. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper uses multi-scale features based on hourglass-like networks and self-residual attention, which are common techniques in the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the paper's use of deep neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
