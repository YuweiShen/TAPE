The proposed framework, interleave/deinterleave transform (IDT), is a signal processing technique that can be applied to various communication scenarios, including those in the signal processing (cs.SI) and systems (cs.SY) communities. The paper also discusses the use of quasi-cyclic (QC) codes, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SI, cs.SY, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
