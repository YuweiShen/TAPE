This is a classic problem in information theory and hence cs.IT is the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers a wireless interference channel and proposes online and/or distributed near-optimal policies. This makes cs.NI a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates an optimization problem to maximize the sum throughput with a given deadline and proposes an iterative coordinate descent method to solve it. This makes cs.SY a likely sub-category. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of power allocation for energy harvesting transmitters, which can be used in multimedia applications. This makes cs.MM a possible sub-category. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes a short-term throughput maximizing offline power allocation policy and gives examples for interference regions with known sum capacities with directional water-filling interpretations. This makes cs.GT a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
