It could also belong to cs.SD (Software Development) as it describes the design and implementation of a custom application for Android and iOS handsets. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it deals with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol for communication between devices. The paper also touches upon the human-computer interaction aspect of using smartphones to measure social connectivity, which could place it under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper involves data analysis and statistical modeling, which could make it relevant to cs.MA (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
