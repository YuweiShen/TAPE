The paper also proposes a new rotation equivariant network architecture, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep supervision scheme in the proposed architecture also suggests the possibility of it belonging to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on the ISIC 2017 skin lesion challenge dataset indicates that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
