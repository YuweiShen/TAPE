The use of light field cameras and the trade-off between angular and spatial resolution suggest that the paper could also belong to graphics (cs.GR). The use of convolutional neural networks for modeling the disparity and color estimation components suggests that the paper could also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of machine learning for view synthesis is a common application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
