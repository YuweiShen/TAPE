This involves addressing issues such as reducing cold start problems, adapting to user interests, and speeding up the learning process. The paper proposes a hybrid Q-learning algorithm that combines Q-learning, collaborative filtering, and case-based reasoning techniques. This work involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
