This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of beamforming and combining code books, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is a statistical inference problem, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
