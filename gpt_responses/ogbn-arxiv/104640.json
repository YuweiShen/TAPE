This involves designing visually sortable glyphs that support comparative analysis and multi-dimensional visual search. The paper also describes a system for interactive sorting and viewing of sorted results. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Graphics (cs.GR), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Databases (cs.DB), and Visualization (cs.VIS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
