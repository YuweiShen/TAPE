The paper also discusses the use of heterogeneous computing resources and the development of an operating system, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the optimization of client system energy consumption, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
