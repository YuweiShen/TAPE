The specific applications mentioned, such as vehicle platooning and formation control, suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.MA). The use of simulation examples implies that the paper may also fall under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the formalisation of the notion of string stability and the generalisation of definitions suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
