This involves the use of data structures such as Compressed Suffix Array (CSA), Wavelet-Tree, and Wavelet Matrix, which are commonly used in computer science research areas such as data structures (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), and self-indexing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on the space requirements and query efficiency of the proposed Compact Trip Representation (CTR), which could also be relevant to the computer engineering (cs.CE) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
