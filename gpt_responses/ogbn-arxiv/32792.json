This involves representing conditional probability distributions (CPDs) of discrete BN nodes as mixtures of local distributions, each having a different set of parents. This approach is related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI), as well as statistical inference and data analysis (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of decision trees (cs.DS) and noisy-OR gates (cs.CE) in representing CPDs, which further supports these likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
