This falls under the scope of computational geometry, which is covered by the cs.CG sub-category. The use of limited workspace also involves data structures and algorithms, which are covered by the cs.DS sub-category. The paper also mentions open problems related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of algorithms with limited workspace can also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY) where memory constraints are often present."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
