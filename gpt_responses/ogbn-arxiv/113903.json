The focus is on the neural mechanisms, which include central pattern generator based control, distributed recurrent neural network based adaptive forward models, and searching and elevation control. These mechanisms are used to generate complex locomotive behaviors, such as walking on undulated terrains, crossing large gaps, and climbing over high obstacles. Given the focus on robotics and neural mechanisms, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) for the neural mechanisms, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the bio-inspired approach, cs.SY (Systems and Control) for the control aspects, and cs.LG (Machine Learning) for the use of recurrent neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
