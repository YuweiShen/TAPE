Flickr, which suggests a connection to this sub-category. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): While not directly related to natural language processing, the paper deals with the problem of assigning cluster labels to data points, which is a task that is often encountered in text clustering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
