The use of deep learning-based saliency models also suggests that the paper could fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the evaluation of the model's ability to predict human fixation patterns suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
