The use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The fact that the proposed network is compact and can be trained end-to-end suggests that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of stereo images and the focus on semantic reasoning suggest that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
