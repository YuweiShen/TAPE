The comparison study between native code and different browser-based implementations involves programming languages and runtime optimization, which could also fit under Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The paper also touches on the efficiency of client environments, which could fall under Software Engineering (cs.SE).
