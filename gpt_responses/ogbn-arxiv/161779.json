The paper also involves software engineering (cs.SE) as it proposes a new approach for detecting these vulnerabilities. The approach involves analyzing the code of the apps, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of dataflow analysis, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
