The approach proposed in the paper involves balancing optimization of primary and auxiliary reward functions, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the potential risks of misspecified reward functions, which is relevant to the field of cybersecurity (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a method for inducing conservative behavior in agents, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
