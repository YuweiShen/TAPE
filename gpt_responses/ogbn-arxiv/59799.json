The use of greedy algorithms and approximation ratios suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as other likely sub-categories. The mention of the size of independent set and the clique cover being tightly bounded by $\\sqrt{n}$ suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as another possible sub-category.
