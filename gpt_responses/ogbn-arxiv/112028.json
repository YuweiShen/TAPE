The use of RRT is also closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions Lipschitz-continuity, which is a concept from mathematical analysis and optimization, making cs.LG a likely category. Finally, the paper discusses the clearance of obstacles, which is a common problem in computer vision and image processing, making cs.CV a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
