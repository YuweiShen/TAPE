Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also uses statistical physics and state evolution analysis, which are relevant to the Mathematical Physics (cs.MP) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. However, since the focus of the paper is on the mutual information in random linear estimation, the Information Theory and Signal Processing sub-categories are the most likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
