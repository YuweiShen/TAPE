The proposed approach involves triangulating the images to simplify the registration computation, which is a technique commonly used in computer graphics (cs.GR) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of high-resolution images and videos also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM). The approach also involves optimization, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Overall, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by computer graphics (cs.GR), multimedia (cs.MM), computational geometry (cs.CG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
