The presence of Byzantine agents also makes it relevant to the field of fault-tolerant systems (cs.SY). The use of global knowledge with a small binary representation suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. Finally, the focus on designing a deterministic solution with lower complexity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of algorithms (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
