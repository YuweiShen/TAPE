Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses potential social challenges and biases in the application of these techniques, which falls under the scope of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper evaluates the performance of CNN models, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CR) concerns related to the potential for false detections or racially biased models. Finally, the paper proposes a novel visualisation technique that involves dimensionality reduction (PCA), which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
