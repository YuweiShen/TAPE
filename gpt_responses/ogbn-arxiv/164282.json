The objects being organized are images and videos, which fall under multimedia (cs.MM). The organization is done through clustering, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of workers clustering based on different perspectives, which relates to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
