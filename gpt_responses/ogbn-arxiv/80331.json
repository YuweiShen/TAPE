The tool also allows for efficient computation of statistics, which is a common task in database (DB) systems. Additionally, the focus on visualization and user interaction suggests a potential fit for human-computer interaction (HC) and social informatics (SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
