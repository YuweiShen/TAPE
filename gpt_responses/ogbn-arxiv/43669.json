This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel interface for planning-phase negotiations, which involves decision-making and coordination, indicating that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of augmented reality, which involves computer vision techniques, suggesting that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
