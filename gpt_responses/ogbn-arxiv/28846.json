Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep convolutional networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of multi-task learning, which is a technique used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimodal learning (cs.MM).
