This involves techniques from modal, substructural, and categorical logic, which are all relevant to the areas of logic and theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses propositional connectives, which falls under the sub-category cs.PL (Programming Languages). Additionally, the paper deals with De Morgan BI and Concurrent Separation Logic, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity), respectively. Finally, the paper contextualizes the \"resource semantics\" interpretation underpinning Separation Logic, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
