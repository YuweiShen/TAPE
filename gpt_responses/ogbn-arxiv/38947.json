The system is designed for navigation systems for intelligent vehicles (cs.RO) and requires precise boundary estimation of traffic signs, which is a challenging problem in computer vision and can benefit from machine learning techniques such as CNN (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the robustness of the proposed method against occlusion and small targets, which are common challenges in computer vision and require advanced techniques such as deep learning (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
