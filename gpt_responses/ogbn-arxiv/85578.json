This involves developing static analysis techniques to automatically compute and apply Predicate Callback Summaries (PCS) to construct apps' callback sequences. The paper focuses on program analysis and testing tools, which suggests a software engineering (cs.SE) focus. The use of PCS also involves modeling control flow information, which suggests a programming languages (cs.PL) focus. The paper also discusses bugs and vulnerabilities, which suggests a focus on computer security (cs.CR). The experiments involve constructing control flow graphs, which suggests a software design (cs.SD) focus. Finally, the paper involves developing a complementary solution to existing work, which suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) focus."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
