This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also proposes a multi-value conditional random field model, which is a probabilistic graphical model, indicating a possible fit for the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of high-dimensional embeddings suggests a possible fit for the graphics (cs.GR) category.
