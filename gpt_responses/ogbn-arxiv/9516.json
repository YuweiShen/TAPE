The use of neural networks to model motion planning tasks suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The extension of the Value Iteration Networks to solve cooperative planning tasks suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The fact that the agents have non-holonomic constraints suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of iterative gradient descent to generate policies suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
