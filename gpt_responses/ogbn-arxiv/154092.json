The paper may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) because it introduces new data structures to maintain information about the state of the parse. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to cs.PL (Programming Languages) because it discusses task parallelism and the implementation of the algorithm. The paper may also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) because natural language processing often involves machine learning techniques. Finally, the paper may be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because parsing is a key component of many AI applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
