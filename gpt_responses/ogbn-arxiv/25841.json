The paper also addresses issues related to coordination and partial failures, which are relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a novel runtime for distributed reactive programming, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
