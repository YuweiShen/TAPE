The method involves tracking a set of random POIs and estimating the 3D pose of the pre-intervention volume through a triangulation layer. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale clinical cone-beam CT (CBCT) dataset. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
