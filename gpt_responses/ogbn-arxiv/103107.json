This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with control problems, which could place it in the robotics (cs.RO) or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The use of deep neural networks and radial-basis functions also suggests a connection to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
