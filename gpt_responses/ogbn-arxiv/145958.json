The paper specifically focuses on the impact of eliminating the cyclic prefix (CP) in OFDM, which is a signal processing technique used in communication systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SI, cs.COMM, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
