This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on simplifying neural networks, which is a common topic in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also discusses the predictive accuracy of ANNs, which is a topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions benchmarks problems in neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed approach with good generalization ability, which is a topic in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
