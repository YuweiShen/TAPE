The experiments conducted in the paper involve crowd-sourcing, which is a common method in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the communicative and analytical intent of visualizations, which is relevant to the sub-category of graphics (cs.GR). The paper's focus on the impact of truncation on subjective effect size is relevant to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR), which often deals with the perception and interpretation of information. Finally, the paper's exploration of alternative designs for alerting viewers to truncation is relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI), which often deals with the design and communication of network visualizations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
