It could also belong to robotics (cs.RO) as it has applications in autonomous driving. Machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories are also likely as the proposed approach involves a multi-scale encoder-decoder network and sparsity-invariant operations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
