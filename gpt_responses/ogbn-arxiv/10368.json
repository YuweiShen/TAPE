The use of a central authority to broadcast signals to agents also suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions analyzing optimization problems in a distributed fashion, which could place it in cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the focus on social and engineering settings could suggest that it belongs to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
