The use of databases and rules for computing derived information suggests a connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and social intelligence (cs.SI). The discussion of stabilization in an unpredictable environment could also relate to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
