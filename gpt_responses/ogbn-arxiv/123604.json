It considers unsupervised learning for batch and sequential data and presents a new algorithm for solving the rate-distortion problem for Gaussian sources. These topics are closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
