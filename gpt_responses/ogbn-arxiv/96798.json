It proposes a new approach to solving NP complete problems by transforming them into P problems in polynomial time. This topic is closely related to computational complexity theory (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
