Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of the algorithm as a preprocessing step for several other algorithms, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper mentions the use of the algorithm for geodesic hulls and Voronoi diagrams, which are topics in cs.GR (Computer Graphics) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
