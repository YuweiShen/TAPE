The paper also considers the security aspect of PIR, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes explicit schemes to achieve the optimal download cost, which involves coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between caching ratio and download cost, which is related to optimization and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
