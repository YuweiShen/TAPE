The paper also discusses the concept of self-evolvable robots, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The correct-by-construction strategy mentioned in the paper is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and the use of formal constructs such as grammars is related to mathematical aspects (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
