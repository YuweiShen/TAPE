This involves the use of multiple antennas and coordination between multiple base stations, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the system-level performance of the proposed technique, which can be related to system engineering (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents simulation results and compares the proposed technique with other multiple access schemes, which can be related to computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
