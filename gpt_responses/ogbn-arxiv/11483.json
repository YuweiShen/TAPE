The paper proposes a graph-based approach for reasoning over heterogeneous external knowledge sources, which involves learning contextual word representations and aggregating evidence with graph attention mechanism. This work involves techniques from computational linguistics (CL), machine learning (ML), and graph theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
