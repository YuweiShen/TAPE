The use of the Nakagami-q distribution is also a common approach in wireless communication systems and signal processing, which falls under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper employs analytic expressions and numerical methods to analyze the performance of the detector, which is related to mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
