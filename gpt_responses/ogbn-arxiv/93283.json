The paper also mentions the use of human commonsense knowledge and reasoning, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves incorporating explicit and implicit knowledge modules, which can be seen as a form of machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on large-scale object detection benchmarks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
