This falls under the scope of machine learning, specifically generative models.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed system uses soft attention mechanisms to leverage both static context and interaction information, which is a common technique in computer vision and pattern recognition tasks.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions that accurate trajectory prediction is critical for intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles and wheeled mobile robotics navigating in complex scenarios. This indicates that the paper is relevant to the field of robotics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to trajectory prediction, which involves making inference from a probability perspective instead of deterministic prediction. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, specifically probabilistic reasoning.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a regularization method for incorporating soft constraints into deep neural networks with differentiable barrier functions. This involves manipulating the output of the neural network based on certain constraints, which is a common technique in natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
