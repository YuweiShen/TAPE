The paper also mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) to capture data, and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to learn from the data. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of the approach and proposes a new data capture protocol, which involves human participants, making it relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses quantitative analysis to validate the protocol, which involves machine learning techniques, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
