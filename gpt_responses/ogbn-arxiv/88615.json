The introduction of soft information to improve decoding precision is a common technique in channel coding (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the complexity of the decoding algorithm, which is a topic in computer science (cs.SI). The use of quantized soft detection information per received bit is a technique used in data storage systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the decoding algorithm in terms of block error rate, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
