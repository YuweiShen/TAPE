The method involves introducing an additional penalty term to encourage robustness, which is related to regularization techniques commonly used in optimization problems in machine learning, and thus also falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization algorithm used in neural networks, and thus falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The experimental results involve both synthetic and real data sets, which suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
