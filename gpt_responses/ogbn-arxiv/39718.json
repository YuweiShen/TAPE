This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with protecting data from unauthorized access. Additionally, the paper involves computations and algorithms, which could also place it under the categories of information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of graphs and permutations suggests a connection to graph theory and discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes carrying out computations on the user's web browser, which could also relate to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
