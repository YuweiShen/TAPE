The paper also discusses the use of linear precoding and power allocation policies, which are common techniques in the field of machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the role of interference in the design of optimal transmission strategies, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper provides a novel interpretation of interference with respect to various parameters, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
