It also uses language modeling as one of the tasks to evaluate the proposed embeddings. The use of recursive neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper's focus on exploiting the structures of logographs could make it relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
