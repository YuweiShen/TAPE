The paper also discusses dynamic mesh refinement, which is a technique used in computational engineering and science. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): There is no explicit mention of symbolic computation in the paper, but the use of complex numbers and complex scaling may involve symbolic manipulation of expressions. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions the use of spacetrees and precomputed local element matrices, which are data structures used in numerical methods for solving partial differential equations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
