This involves exploring methods for bidding and game declaration, as well as discussing the value of incorporating human data for reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (artificial intelligence) and cs.LG (machine learning), followed by cs.GT (game theory) as the paper deals with decision-making in games. The use of deep neural networks also suggests possible relevance to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), although these are less likely given the focus on Skat."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
