The paper also discusses sparsity constraints, which are a key concept in these fields. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The paper also involves optimization and algorithm design, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
