The paper proposes and evaluates novel strategies for creating ensembles, such as parameter sharing and training under ensemble-aware and diversity-encouraging losses. These strategies are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, given the focus on deep learning and image classification tasks, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
