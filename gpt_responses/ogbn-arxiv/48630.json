It also involves graph isomorphism, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper uses logical reasoning and criteria to determine the complexity of the problem, which is related to logic and proof theory (cs.LO). The problem of Boolean constraint isomorphism is also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS) as it has applications in constraint satisfaction problems and database management."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
