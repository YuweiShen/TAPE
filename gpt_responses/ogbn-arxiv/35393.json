The paper focuses on improving the level of detail in QPNs to better resolve trade-offs during inference. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
