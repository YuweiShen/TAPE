The paper discusses the use of decision trees and mixture of experts to achieve this goal. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses safety-critical settings, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the use of automated theorem provers, which could place it in the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
