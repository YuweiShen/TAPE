The paper proposes a hybrid control design for autonomous vehicles at uncontrolled intersections, which is a common scenario in robotics research. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses the concept of gap acceptance to model pedestrian behavior, which is a common technique used in AI research. The paper also compares the proposed hybrid controller to an alternate POMDP solution, which is a common AI technique. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, but it is likely that computer vision techniques are used to detect pedestrians and other objects in the environment. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hybrid control design for autonomous vehicles, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, which is a key area of research in human-computer interaction. The paper also considers the importance of earning the trust of humans in everyday driving situations, which is a common theme in HCI research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
