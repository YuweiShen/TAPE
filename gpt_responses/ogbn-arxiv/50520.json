The use of random binning technique suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM), where random binning is often used for compression. The consideration of correlated state information may also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of networking (cs.NI) and computer communications (cs.CC) due to the focus on multiple access channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
