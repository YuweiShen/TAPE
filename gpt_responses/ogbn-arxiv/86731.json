The proposed method involves the aggregation of local point-wise features using frustums, which is a technique that has been used in previous works on object detection and segmentation (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of fully convolutional networks (FCN) and multi-resolution features, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of ablation studies to verify the efficacy of different component variants, which is a common practice in machine learning research (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses experiments on two different datasets, which involves natural language processing techniques for text data (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
