Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper proposes a new structure to avoid checkerboard artifacts, which is a technical contribution related to artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which is a topic related to multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
