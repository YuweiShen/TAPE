The extension of the toolbox to include number-theoretic capabilities suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of arithmetic-based cryptographic primitives implies that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT). The implementation of the toolbox on top of Coq suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the focus on machine checking of game-based proofs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
