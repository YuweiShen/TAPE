The paper also evaluates and compares different techniques for training neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of transfer learning and parameter modification after transfer learning are also discussed, which are topics related to neural networks (cs.NE) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
