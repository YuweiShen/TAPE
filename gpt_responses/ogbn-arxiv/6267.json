The paper also proposes a transfer learning setting and introduces improvements to the Deep Embedded Clustering algorithm, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses methods for estimating the number of classes in unlabelled data, which is related to clustering (cs.CL) and potentially multimedia (cs.MM) if the unlabelled data includes other types of media besides images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
