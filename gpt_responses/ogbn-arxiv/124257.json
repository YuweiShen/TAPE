Computer vision techniques such as pose tracking and face tracking are used to identify and track customers. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on improving the shopping experience by enabling cashier-free shopping. The system needs to accurately identify and track customers, which involves human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The system uses a probabilistic framework to fuse readings from different sensors to accurately assess which shopper picks up which item. This involves information retrieval techniques. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The system uses algorithms for associating and tracking arm movements, which involves machine learning techniques. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The system uses cameras and sensors to capture multimedia data (e.g., images, weight readings) and processes them to enable cashier-free shopping."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
