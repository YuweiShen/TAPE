This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science subfields, including information theory (cs.IT), communication (cs.COMM), systems and control (cs.SY), architecture (cs.AR), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Given the emphasis on communication and signal processing, cs.IT and cs.COMM are the most likely categories. The focus on system design and implementation suggests cs.SY and cs.AR as additional possibilities. Finally, the use of over-the-air experiments and the emphasis on synchronization suggest cs.NI as a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
