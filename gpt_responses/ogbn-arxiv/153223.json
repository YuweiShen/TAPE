The use of regularization by a block 1-norm and the extension to multiple kernel learning suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The study of asymptotic model consistency and the use of functional analysis and covariance operators suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
