This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses transfer learning and feature extraction, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of spectral dimensionality reduction makes this paper relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the experiments involve benchmarks and statistical tests, which suggest a focus on graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
