The paper focuses on identifying the cause of the divergences and proposing solutions to avoid resorting to more concrete, syntactic domains. This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including programming languages (cs.PL), logic (cs.LO), software engineering (cs.SE), formal methods (cs.FL), and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
