The paper also discusses active query selection, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions handwritten digits, which is a common dataset in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the algorithm on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
