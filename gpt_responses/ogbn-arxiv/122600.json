This work is highly relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) community as it deals with CNNs and their decision-making process. Additionally, the paper involves deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques to explain the classification decisions of CNNs. The Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) approach, which is the theoretical foundation of CLRP, is based on neural networks (cs.NE) and has been used in natural language processing (cs.CL) as well. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
