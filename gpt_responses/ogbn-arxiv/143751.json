The paper discusses the use of multiple models, feature space augmentation, regularization, and ensembling to improve the performance of the classification system. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), information retrieval (cs.IR), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
