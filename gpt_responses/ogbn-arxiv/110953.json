Additionally, it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves volumetric reconstruction of human performance. The use of deep learning techniques suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the application of the method in on-set and prosumer scenarios suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
