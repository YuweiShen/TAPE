The proposed scheme involves the use of fixed-length packets and Markov block coding, which are techniques commonly used in communication systems (cs.SY) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of feedback bits to report the delayed CSIT, which is a topic relevant to communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
