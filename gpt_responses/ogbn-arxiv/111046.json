This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the problem of detecting hazardous pedestrian behaviour is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the time-critical aspect of the problem makes it relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
