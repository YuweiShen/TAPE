This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Information Theory sub-category. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of the orthogonality decision problem, which is a computational problem. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Computational Complexity sub-category. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the applications of lattices in modern cryptography, which suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Cryptography and Security sub-category. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an efficient algorithm to solve the orthogonality decision problem, which suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with lattices, which are discrete mathematical objects.
