Specifically, the paper focuses on rectangular complexes, which are a type of geometric object commonly studied in computational geometry. The paper also uses techniques from data structures and graph theory, which are relevant to computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
