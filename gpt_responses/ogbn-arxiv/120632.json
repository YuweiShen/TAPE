The three tasks used to demonstrate the approach are related to natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which suggests that the paper could also be classified under \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL) and \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV). The use of auxiliary features to improve the performance of the stacking method is a novel contribution and could be of interest to researchers in the field of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of provenance information, which is relevant to the field of \"Information Retrieval\" (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
