This involves leveraging semantic natural language observations provided by human sensors to efficiently reacquire and localize mobile targets that can remain out of view for long periods of time in large spaces. The paper also proposes a scalable hierarchical Gaussian mixture model formulation for efficiently solving CPOMDPs with semantic observations in continuous dynamic state spaces. Given these focus areas, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
