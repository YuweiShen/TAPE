The use of convex optimization in the proposed framework also suggests a potential connection to optimization and control (cs.OH). However, since the focus of the paper is on the robustness of state estimation against attacks, we consider cs.SY and cs.CR to be the most likely categories, followed by cs.IT, cs.LG, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
