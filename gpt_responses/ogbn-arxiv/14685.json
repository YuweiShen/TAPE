This involves modelling the behaviour of strategic agents using DRL with a high-dimensional state space. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves learning policies that outperform several baselines, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Finally, the paper involves a strategic board game where players can offer resources in exchange for others and reply to offers made by other players, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
