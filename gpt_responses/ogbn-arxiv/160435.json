The use of tensor rank and its relation to quantum nondeterminism suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the study of boolean functions and their complexity fits under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper specifically mentions quantum information (cs.QI) in its abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
