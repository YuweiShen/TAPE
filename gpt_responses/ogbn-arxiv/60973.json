The use of composition multisets and polynomial factorization also suggests connections to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a Reed-Solomon type coding redundancy, which is a common technique in coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
