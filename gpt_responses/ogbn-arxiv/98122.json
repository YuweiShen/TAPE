The use of feedback from the receiver to specify a transmit precoding matrix involves communication networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of random vector quantization (RVQ), which is a technique used in machine learning and data compression (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses numerical examples to validate the theoretical results, which falls under the category of machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
