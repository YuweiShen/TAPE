The focus on avoiding unnecessary disruptions to the environment suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The empirical experiments and comparisons with existing approaches suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
