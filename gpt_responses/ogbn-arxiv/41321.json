This falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and communication and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also considers self-interference cancellation, which is a key aspect of cognitive radio networks and falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The optimization of the protocol configuration involves control theory and optimization (cs.SY), and the numerical results involve multimedia (cs.MM) in terms of throughput performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
