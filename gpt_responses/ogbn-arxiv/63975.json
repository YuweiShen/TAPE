The paper also mentions applications to wire-tap coding, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The construction involves a generalization of Construction A, which is a well-known technique in coding theory and is closely related to the theory of lattices (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of the construction for coset coding, which is a topic in coding theory and has applications in communication systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses previous results obtained for lattices from sigma-constacyclic codes, which is a specific type of cyclic code, and thus falls under the category of algebraic coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
