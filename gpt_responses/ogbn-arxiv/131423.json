Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also considers practical system constraints and power consumption, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the use of CMOS for mmWave, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
