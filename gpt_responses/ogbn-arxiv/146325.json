The paper also discusses the reduction of parameters and memory footprint, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed network also involves the use of context information, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on two popular datasets in computer vision (Cityscapes and CamVid), which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
