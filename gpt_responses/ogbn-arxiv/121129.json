The paper also discusses uncertainty estimation, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of ensembling and MC-dropout, which are both machine learning techniques, further supports the likelihood of these sub-categories. The paper also mentions automotive applications, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the mention of Bayesian deep learning suggests that the neural networks used in the paper may have a probabilistic interpretation, which is a common topic in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
