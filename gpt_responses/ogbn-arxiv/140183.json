The paper focuses on a specific strategy for controlling the amount of reasoning with explicit theory axioms. This topic is relevant to several areas of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), and data structures (cs.DS). However, given the focus on theorem proving and logic, cs.LO is the most likely category, followed by cs.AI and cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
