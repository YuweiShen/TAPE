The paper discusses the use of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation methods to solve the non-convex homogeneous QCQP formulation, which is a common technique in optimization (cs.OH) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). However, since the paper focuses on the specific problem of spectrum sharing in MIMO cognitive radio networks, the aforementioned categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
