Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and digital libraries (DL), which are covered by cs.IR and cs.DL sub-categories, respectively. The use of machine learning algorithms for information extraction falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the discussion of novel use cases involving public datasets and digital libraries can be categorized under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
