The paper also discusses the time complexity of these problems, which is a topic studied in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The use of rational exponents in the complexity analysis suggests that Information Theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. Finally, the paper discusses the landscape of distributed time complexity, which is a topic studied in the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
