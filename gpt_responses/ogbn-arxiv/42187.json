This involves capturing inter-core crosstalk, which is a prominent impairment in optical networks operating with multicore fibers. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the development and application of neural networks and other machine learning algorithms. The paper's use of deep graph convolutional neural networks for QoT estimation makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. The paper's focus on QoT estimation in optical networks involves dealing with impairments that affect the transmission of information, making it a possible fit for this sub-category.\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development and application of machine learning algorithms. The paper's use of machine learning for QoT estimation makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the analysis and interpretation of visual data. While the paper does not deal with visual data, the use of graph convolutional neural networks may involve similar techniques used in computer vision, making it a possible fit for this sub-category.\n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence):"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
