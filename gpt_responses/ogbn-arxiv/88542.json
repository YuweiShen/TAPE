This involves training agents to infer other agents' observations when provided with locally available context. This is a machine learning problem and hence falls under the cs.LG category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to multi-agent learning that involves generative modeling to handle partially-observable information during decentralized execution. This is an AI problem and hence falls under the cs.AI category.\n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper proposes a new approach to multi-agent learning that involves generative modeling to handle partially-observable information during decentralized execution. This is a multi-agent systems problem and hence falls under the cs.MA category.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed approach can be applied to multi-robot systems where agents need to communicate and coordinate with each other to perform tasks. This falls under the cs.RO category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed approach involves training agents to infer other agents' observations when provided with locally available context.
