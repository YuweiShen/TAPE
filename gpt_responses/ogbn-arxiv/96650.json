Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which makes cs.IR a likely category as well. Additionally, the paper deals with machine learning models for ranking, which could fall under cs.LG (Learning). The use of word embeddings also falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, since the paper deals with spoken documents, cs.SD (Sound) could also be a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
