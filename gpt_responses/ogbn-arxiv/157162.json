Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of real-time performance and limited hardware, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also introduces new techniques for decreasing runtime and reducing hardware requirements, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
