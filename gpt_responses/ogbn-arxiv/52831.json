The paper specifically deals with the problem of high-dimensional data, which suggests that it may fall under \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) or \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of solvers and optimization techniques, which are common in \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with multiple data matrices, which suggests that it may also fall under \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
