The use of self-supervised learning to estimate distance-to-goal is a technique that is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY). However, given that the paper focuses on reinforcement learning and goal-conditioned policies, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LG or cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
