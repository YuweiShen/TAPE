The paper also discusses the evolution of dataflow graphs through almost continuous transformations, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper introduces a new system for programming with dataflow graphs, which could be considered an application or implementation of the ideas presented in the paper, and thus could be classified under the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
