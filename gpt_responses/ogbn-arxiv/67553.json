Specifically, the paper investigates the limits of deep learning as the network width increases, which is a problem that is closely related to the study of neural networks and their behavior (cs.NE). The experiments are performed on image datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR10, which are commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the role of network architecture and data structure in determining the training regime, which is a topic that is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper analyzes the fluctuations induced by initial conditions on the learned function, which is a problem that is related to the study of control systems and their stability (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
