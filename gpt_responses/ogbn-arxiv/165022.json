The paper also presents a theoretical result on the succinctness of SDDs compared to OBDDs, which could place it in the cs.LO (logic in computer science) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves constructing boolean functions, which could relate to the cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.DM (discrete mathematics) sub-categories. Finally, the paper settles an open problem in knowledge compilation, which could place it in the cs.CC (computational complexity) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
