This falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is commonly used in game AI (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of learned heuristics also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the application of cooperative planning to automated vehicles suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
