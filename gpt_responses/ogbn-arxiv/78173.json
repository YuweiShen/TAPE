This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the design of symbol constellations of arbitrary order and analyzes the error probability performance. This is a key area of information theory.\n3. cs.PE (Power and Energy): The paper deals with communication in a DC Micro Grid, which is a sub-domain of power and energy.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses communication among units in a Micro Grid, which involves distributed computing and communication.\n5. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The concept of using power electronics as modems for communication in a Micro Grid is a novel and emerging technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
