This involves the use of predicate liftings, which are a key concept in coalgebraic modal logic. \n2. cs.LOgic (Logic in Computer Science) - The paper's focus on predicate liftings and modal fixed point formulas is closely related to the study of logic in computer science. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper's use of expression languages and finite systems may be relevant to the study of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper's focus on expression languages and semantics may be relevant to the study of programming languages. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper's use of weighted, probabilistic, and neighbourhood-based system types may be relevant to the study of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
