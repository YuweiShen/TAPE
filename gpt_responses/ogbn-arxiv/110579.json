The use of spectral knowledge also suggests that it could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category. The paper also involves training a deep learning model, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the use of multiple data sets and the multitask learning approach could suggest that it belongs to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
