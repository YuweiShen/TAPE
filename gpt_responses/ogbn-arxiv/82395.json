Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with classification models. The paper also involves data structures (cs.DS) as it compares the performance of XGBoost trained on different types of data. Lastly, the paper involves software engineering (cs.SE) as it contributes a novel method for utilizing human created classification models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
