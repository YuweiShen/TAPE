The use of holomorphic embeddings and algebraic curves also suggests a systems and control perspective. \n\n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the use of standard analytic techniques (power series) for practical computation, which is a key aspect of numerical analysis. \n\n3. cs.DS (Dynamical Systems): The power-flow equations in power grids can be viewed as a dynamical system, and the paper discusses a method for solving them. \n\n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The use of algebraic curves and holomorphic embeddings suggests a symbolic computation perspective. \n\n5. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The use of advanced complex analysis and holomorphic embeddings in solving power-flow equations is a relatively new and emerging technique, which could fall under the emerging technologies category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
