The paper uses algebraic methods to develop this theory, which is closely related to topics such as linear algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SP (Signal Processing), which is the primary category for research on signal processing. Other likely categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), as these categories are also relevant to the topics covered in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
