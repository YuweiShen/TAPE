The use of random variables and probability distributions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to statistical inference (cs.ST) and machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of analytical results and mathematical expressions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
