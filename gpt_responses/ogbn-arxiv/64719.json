The use of succinct coordinates suggests that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The reduction in bandwidth and header size implies that the paper may be applicable to networking and communications (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
