The proposed closed-loop control framework involves learning the QoE function, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The optimization also involves video processing and analysis, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper aims to meet users' profiles, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
