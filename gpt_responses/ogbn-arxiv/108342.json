The attacks are designed to be black-box and transferable, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of signal degradation on the attacks, which could be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
