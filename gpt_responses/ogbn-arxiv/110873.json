The use of abelian groups and the mention of convexity suggests that it may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The mention of \"extremum\" suggests optimization, which could place it in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the mention of \"Lemma\" suggests that it may also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
