The most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) since the paper deals with language acquisition and speech recognition. The use of visual cues and image-to-words mapping also suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.SD (Sound) sub-categories.
