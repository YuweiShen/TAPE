This involves estimating the field of view of the input images and synthesizing a high-resolution panoramic output. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, which deals with image and video processing, analysis, and understanding. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with the synthesis of panoramic images. Multimedia (cs.MM) is also a possible sub-category as the paper involves processing and synthesizing images. \n\nThe paper also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses a learning-based approach for image synthesis. Finally, the paper involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses a learning-based approach for image synthesis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
