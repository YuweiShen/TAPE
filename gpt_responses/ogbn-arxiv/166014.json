The paper also proposes a novel multi-task loss function, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of synthetic data for training the network is also a common technique in computer vision and machine learning (cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the segmentation of complex branching structures, which can be considered a problem in graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
