The approach involves enforcing consistency of the reflectance estimates with respect to each view, which suggests a focus on graphics (cs.GR). The paper also mentions a regularization term for piecewise-smoothness, which is a common technique in image processing (cs.MM). The use of geometry and parameterization in the image domain suggests a possible connection to computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the use of a variational method and numerical optimization suggests a possible connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
