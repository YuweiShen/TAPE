This is a common theme in machine learning.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Although the paper does not explicitly deal with social networks, the techniques used in the analysis of nonstationary Gauss-Markov processes may have applications in modeling and analyzing social networks.\n4. cs.SP (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with the analysis of a stochastic process and provides a bound on the estimation error.
