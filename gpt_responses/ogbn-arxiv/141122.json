The use of information theory to interpret tuning curves is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The specific application of the method to population coding of visual motion (cs.CV) and the observation of diverse tuning curve shapes in neurophysiological experiments (cs.SY) also suggest these categories. Finally, the use of optimization techniques to find optimal tuning curves is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
