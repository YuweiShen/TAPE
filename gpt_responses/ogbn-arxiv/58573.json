The paper also discusses the use of adaptive sensing strategies, which falls under the category of adaptive signal processing (cs.SP, cs.LG). The paper establishes fundamental performance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of randomized Gaussian measurement strategies, which is a topic in random matrix theory (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of optimization algorithms for signal recovery, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
