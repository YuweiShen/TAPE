The paper proposes a new objective function and a new technique to address the problem of posterior collapse in VAEs, which is a common issue in generative models. This makes the paper relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
