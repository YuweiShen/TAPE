This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Neural and Evolutionary Computing.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed model uses linear regression, which is a common machine learning technique. Additionally, the paper discusses the training of the model, which is a key aspect of machine learning. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under Machine Learning.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a new model that combines neural networks and external memory to solve benchmark tests. This is a common theme in artificial intelligence research, and the paper is likely to be categorized under Artificial Intelligence.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses a model that has an external memory, which can be seen as a control system. Additionally, the paper proposes a new model that can store information without interference, which is a key aspect of control systems. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under Systems and Control.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses a model that can store information without interference, which is a key aspect of information theory.
