The proposed approach involves the integration of object detection and tracking into a dynamic Kalman model, which requires machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a saliency map and temporal information, which are related to signal processing and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
