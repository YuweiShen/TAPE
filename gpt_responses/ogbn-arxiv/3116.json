The focus on low CPU overhead and high throughput suggests operating systems (cs.OS) as another likely category. The use of RDMA in cloud computing platforms also suggests a systems perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the emphasis on scalability and service-oriented architecture suggests distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
