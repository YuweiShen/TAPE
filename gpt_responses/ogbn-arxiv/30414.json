This involves feature extraction from impedance plane analysis and shape recognition. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.LG, which deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper also involves image processing and pattern recognition, which are covered by cs.CV. Additionally, the use of geometric parameters suggests the possibility of neural networks, which are covered by cs.NE. Finally, the paper involves software engineering aspects such as testing and performance evaluation, which are covered by cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
