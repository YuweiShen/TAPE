The paper also introduces a novel maintenance-free image change detection (ICD) framework that requires no background modeling, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The proposed method also involves the use of LCD as the main process for ICD, which can be seen as an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in robotics. Finally, the paper presents experimental results that validate the efficacy of the proposed method, which involves system engineering (cs.SY) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
