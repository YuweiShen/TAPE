Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of beamforming and user association, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data-driven model refinements, which is a topic related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of limited channel state information, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of millimeter-wave bands, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
