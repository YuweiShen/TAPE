The proposed approach uses information theory quantifiers, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of One-Class Support Vector Machines, which is a technique commonly used in anomaly detection (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed approach in biometrics and forensic science, which are areas of research in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
