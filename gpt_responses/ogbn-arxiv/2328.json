The construction of codes and their efficiency for recovery suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The study of codes and their properties also has applications in complexity theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
