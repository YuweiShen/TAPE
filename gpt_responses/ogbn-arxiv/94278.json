This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper involves optimizing the allocation of resources while ensuring a minimum data rate requirement. This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and rate-distortion theory.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with optimizing the energy efficiency of a system while ensuring quality of service requirements. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper involves optimizing the allocation of resources in a strategic setting where the small cell and macro cell engage in spectrum-power trading. This falls under the domain of game theory.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper involves optimizing the allocation of resources for serving macro cell users and small cell users, which may involve multimedia content such as video streaming.
