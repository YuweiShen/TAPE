Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also involves graph theory and algorithms, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AL (Algorithms). The degree splitting problem involves balancing the degrees of nodes, which is related to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the algorithms are designed to work in a distributed setting, which is related to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
