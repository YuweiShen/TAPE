The proposed method involves the use of multiple frames and temporal information, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also introduces a new architecture for presentation attack detection, which involves supervised learning (cs.LG). As the paper deals with security and fraud detection, it can also be categorized under cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of deep learning and neural networks for face anti-spoofing can also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
