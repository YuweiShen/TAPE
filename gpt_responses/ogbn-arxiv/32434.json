The paper also discusses the impact of system parameters on the overall performance, which is relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical formalism and closed-form expressions, which are common in the field of mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
