The use of deep 3D feature extractors and image modeling techniques aligns with the scope of computer vision research. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes an extension of the traditional image comparison-based ICD tasks to setups of the image retrieval (IR) task. The use of bag-of-words (BoW) IR paradigm and deep 3D neural codes aligns with the scope of information retrieval research. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of an unsupervised Siamese network for training a deep 3D feature extractor. The use of machine learning techniques aligns with the scope of machine learning research. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image change detection using a 3D imagery system and proposes a novel framework for the same. The use of deep 3D feature extractors and image modeling techniques aligns with the scope of multimedia research. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with image change detection using an on-board 3D imagery system. The use of image alignment and image differencing techniques aligns with the scope of robotics research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
