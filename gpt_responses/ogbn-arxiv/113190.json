The paper also proposes a compact CNN architecture for scene flow estimation, which involves robotics and control (cs.RO). The use of specialized design decisions and self-supervised strategies to model occlusions and large motion suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
