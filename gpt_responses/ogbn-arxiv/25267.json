These are all related to programming languages. \n- cs.TL (Type Theory) is another possible category as the paper presents a typing system with non-idempotent intersection types. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory) is a less likely category as the paper does not seem to focus on information theory. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a less likely category as the paper does not seem to focus on machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
