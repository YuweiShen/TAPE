The paper proposes a search method for weakly supervised KBQA, which involves semantic parsing and operator prediction. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which are directly related to NLP and AI. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as model training and search optimization, which are covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with knowledge representation and database querying, which are relevant to cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
