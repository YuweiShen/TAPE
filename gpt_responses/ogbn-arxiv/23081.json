The use of a resilient controller to deal with adversarial agents also falls under this category. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): Formation control is a common problem in robotics, and the paper's focus on multi-agent systems suggests a robotics application. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper deals with a multi-agent system and its control, which is a core topic in multiagent systems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of a resilient controller to deal with adversarial agents can be seen as an application of AI techniques to control problems. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with a distributed system of agents and their control, which falls under the scope of distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
