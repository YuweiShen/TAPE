This falls under the broad category of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The use of selection diversity also suggests a possible connection to system theory (cs.SY) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the mention of Meijer G-functions may indicate a potential link to mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
