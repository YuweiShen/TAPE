The problem is also related to computational complexity (cs.CC) as the authors show that it is NP-hard. Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as the authors discuss finding an appropriate factor of the graph. Finally, the problem can be viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem (cs.CG) as the authors are looking for a specific type of matching."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
