The paper proposes a new layer and loss that can be used with existing learning-based boundary detectors, which suggests that it belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also explicitly reasons about annotation noise during training, which involves machine learning techniques and could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments and results, which suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the issue of misaligned labels, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
