The use of algorithms and polynomial time suggest that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS). The concept of convexification and the mention of moves suggest that the paper may also be relevant to game theory (cs.GT) and graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the mention of moves and algorithms suggest that the paper may also be relevant to control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
