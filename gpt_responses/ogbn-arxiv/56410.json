Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and signal processing, which are the main topics of this paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the communication problem in HST scenarios, which is a typical networking and internet architecture problem. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a bandit inspired beam searching scheme based on reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses machine learning techniques to solve the beam searching problem, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of a control system for mmWave HST communications, which involves the optimization of beamforming and channel estimation. This topic is closely related to the systems and control field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
