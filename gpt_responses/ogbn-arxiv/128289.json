Additionally, the paper discusses communication networks and packet loss, which are relevant to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The use of dead-beat control laws and linear-quadratic loss also suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) sub-categories.
