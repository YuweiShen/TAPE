This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories related to data structures, databases, numerical analysis, and computational engineering. \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for sparse matrix multiplication that incorporates many in-memory optimizations for large power-law graphs. This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DS sub-category. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper compares the performance of its implementation with distributed implementations of Trilinos using five times as much processing power. This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DC sub-category. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with the problem of scaling sparse matrix multiplication beyond memory capacity, which is a common problem in databases that deal with large graphs. This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DB sub-category. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper applies its SpMM to three important data analysis tasks\u2014PageRank, eigensolving, and non-negative matrix factorization\u2014and shows that its SEM implementations significantly advance the state of the art. This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.CE sub-category. \n- cs.NA"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
