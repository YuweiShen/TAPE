The use of qualitative relationships and abstraction operations suggests a focus on reasoning and decision-making, which could also place the paper in the social and information sciences (cs.SI) category. The algorithmic approach to obtaining monotonically tightening bounds suggests a focus on optimization and algorithms, which could place the paper in the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) category. Finally, the use of probability distributions suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
