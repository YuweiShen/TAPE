The paper also discusses the use of these codes in private information retrieval and secure multiparty computation, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR). The construction of these codes involves the use of randomized encoding, which is a technique commonly used in distributed computing and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between the rate of the code and the number of queries, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of these codes in average-case complexity, which is a topic in theoretical computer science and algorithms (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
