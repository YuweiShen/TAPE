The paper proposes a polar coding scheme for this problem, which is a popular coding technique in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper is primarily concerned with the problem of secure communication, which falls under the domain of cryptography and security. The paper proposes a coding scheme that ensures strong secrecy and randomness constraints. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly deal with social networks, but the problem of secure communication over a broadcast channel can be relevant in the context of social networks where multiple users need to communicate securely. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not deal with computational complexity directly, but the proposed coding scheme is designed to have low complexity. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not deal with multimedia directly, but the problem of secure communication over a broadcast channel can be relevant in the context of multimedia applications where multiple users need to access multimedia content securely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
