The paper specifically addresses the issue of address translation in memory-side processing units (MPUs) and proposes a new approach called Distributed Inverted Page Table (DIPTA), which is related to operating systems (cs.OS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the limitations of conventional translation mechanisms, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a solution that improves system performance, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
