The paper proposes a new method called Random Fourier Softmax (RF-softmax) that utilizes Random Fourier Features to enable more efficient and accurate sampling from an approximate softmax distribution. This method is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Among these sub-categories, cs.LG is the most likely as it specifically deals with the problem of training models in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
