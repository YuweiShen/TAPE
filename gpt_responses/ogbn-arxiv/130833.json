This involves adapting the L* exact-learning algorithm to a probabilistic setting with noise. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a machine learning algorithm for extracting a PDFA from a black-box language model.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with language models and automata, which are relevant topics in computational linguistics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an AI algorithm for learning a PDFA from a black-box model, which is a relevant topic in AI.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the use of conditional probabilities and local tolerance, which are relevant concepts in cryptography and security.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with algorithms for learning automata, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
