This falls under the domain of natural language processing, which is a subfield of computational linguistics. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of lexical resources to improve machine translation can be seen as an application of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of statistical machine translation, which is a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of various lexical resources such as IndoWordnet semantic relation set, function words, kridanta pairs and verb phrases. These resources can be seen as aiding in information retrieval for the machine translation system. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural networks or evolutionary algorithms, these techniques are commonly used in machine translation and could potentially be applied in conjunction with the lexical resources described in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
