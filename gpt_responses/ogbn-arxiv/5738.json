The approach involves a set of independent workers that use broadcast to update each other, which could also fall under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also applies the approach to learning boosted trees, which could suggest it belongs to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
