The paper also presents a process calculus model for floating authorizations, which is a formal method for specifying and reasoning about programming languages and systems, falling under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the operational semantics of the model, which is a topic that falls under the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of authorization assignment in the system specification, which is a topic that falls under the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper introduces a typing discipline to ensure that systems never get stuck due to lacking authorizations, which is a topic that falls under the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
