The paper discusses the design and implementation of CCF and proposes query-based and decoding-based methods for identifying different elements between given multisets. The paper also provides comprehensive evaluation results comparing CCF with counting Bloom filter (CBF) in terms of synchronization accuracy, space-efficiency, and time-consumption. Based on these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a novel data structure (CCF) for representing and synchronizing multisets in distributed applications. The paper also discusses the design and implementation of CCF and compares it with another data structure (CBF) in terms of space-efficiency and time-consumption. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper addresses the problem of synchronizing multisets in distributed applications, which is a common issue in database systems. The paper proposes a method using CCF for representing and synchronizing multisets and evaluates its performance in terms of synchronization accuracy, space-efficiency, and time-consumption. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the security aspects of synchronizing multisets in distributed applications and proposes a method using CCF for representing and synchronizing multis"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
