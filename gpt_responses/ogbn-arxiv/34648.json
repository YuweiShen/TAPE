This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the proposed distributed optimization-based heuristic can be seen as a form of machine learning, as it involves learning from past iterations to improve the charging schedule and power trading decisions.\n- cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper involves multiple aggregators competing for profits in a non-cooperative game, where each aggregator aims to maximize its own profit. This falls under the scope of game theory.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves solving a large-scale optimization problem with non-convex constraints, which requires computational methods and techniques. This falls under the scope of computational engineering.\n- cs.ETM (Emerging Technologies): Electric vehicles and their integration with the power grid are considered emerging technologies, and the paper proposes a novel approach for coordinating EV charging and power trading, which falls under the scope of emerging technologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
