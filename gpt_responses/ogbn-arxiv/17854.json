The approach combines information from the Natural Gradient (NG) direction with local curvature information of the error surface. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers on the theory and algorithms of machine learning. The paper proposes a new optimization approach for training DNNs, which falls under the scope of this sub-category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers papers on natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper uses Time Delay Neural Networks as speech recognition acoustic models, which suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers on computer vision and pattern recognition. Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the proposed optimization approach could be applied to computer vision tasks, which suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers on neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. The paper proposes a new optimization approach for training DNNs, which falls under the scope of this sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category covers papers on sound and audio processing.
