This problem is related to the representation of local graph structures and the multiscale nature of graph data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
