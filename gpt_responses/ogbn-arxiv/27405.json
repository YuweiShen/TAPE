The use of magnetic tunnel junctions also involves the study of electronic devices and circuits (cs.ET) and electromagnetism (cs.EM). Additionally, the paper discusses the scaling effect of the devices, which could be related to the field of embedded systems (cs.ES) and materials science (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
