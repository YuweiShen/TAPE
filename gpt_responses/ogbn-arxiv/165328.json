It also involves optimization (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) as the agent aims to maximize the expected total reward subject to a safety constraint. Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for policy optimization, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
