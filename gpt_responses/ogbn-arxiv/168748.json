This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) as it involves detecting objects in images for navigation and interaction with the environment. The use of machine learning techniques such as YOLOv2 also suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a likely sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed method and comparison with other approaches involves metrics such as precision and recall, indicating a focus on machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). Finally, the use of omnidirectional images suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
