The paper proposes a two-layer decoding method to mitigate both coherent and non-coherent interference in multi-cell Massive MIMO. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a cooperative decoding method for multi-cell Massive MIMO systems, which is a key aspect of wireless networking. The paper also formulates a sum SE maximization problem with both the data power and LSFD vectors as optimization variables, which is a relevant problem in networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of inter-cell interference in multi-cell Massive MIMO systems, which is a relevant problem in social and information networks. The paper proposes a cooperative decoding method to mitigate this interference. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a method to improve the spectral efficiency of multi-cell Massive MIMO systems, which is a relevant problem in multimedia applications. The paper also formulates a sum SE maximization problem, which is a relevant problem in multimedia applications. \n\n5. cs.COM (Computer Communications and Networks): The paper proposes a cooperative decoding method for multi-cell Massive MIMO systems, which is a key aspect of computer communications and networks.
