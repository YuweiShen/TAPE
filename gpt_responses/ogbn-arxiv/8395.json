This falls under the domain of systems and control, which is a sub-category of computer science. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper describes the architecture of the TIRA library, which features a central function working as a hub between the user-defined reachability problem and the library of available reachability methods. This design choice offers increased extensibility of the library, which can be seen as a software engineering aspect. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions the use of monotonicity concepts in some of the reachability methods implemented in TIRA. Monotonicity is a concept from mathematical logic, which can be applied in computer science. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents methods for computing reachable sets, which can be used in safety verification of autonomous systems. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, which is a sub-category of computer science. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions the use of TIRA for verifying the safety of a quadrotor drone. This falls under the domain of robotics, which is a sub-category of computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
