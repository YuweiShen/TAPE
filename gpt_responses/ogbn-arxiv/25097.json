The proposed system uses deep-learning to automatically learn the intrinsic features from various scanned images. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with security and privacy issues, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of machine learning techniques suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
