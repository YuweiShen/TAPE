The proposed method involves solving an st-MINCUT problem, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses experiments using both synthetic and real data, which suggests a focus on data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
