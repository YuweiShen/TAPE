The use of multi-aspect preferences and the proposed probabilistic multivariate tensor factorization framework suggest that the paper may also be relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Science (cs.DS). Finally, the focus on ranking and the use of a probabilistic criterion may also make the paper relevant to Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
