This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper specifically focuses on parsing text to SQL, which involves reasoning over database structures, making it relevant to databases (cs.DB). The proposed method involves using graph neural networks for message-passing, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also involves ranking queries based on their alignment to the question, which is a task related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
