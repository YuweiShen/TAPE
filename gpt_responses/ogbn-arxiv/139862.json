The paper also presents protocols for deterministic broadcasting and gossiping, which are problems related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of polynomially large labels, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents a probabilistic method for designing protocols, which is a topic related to statistical learning and inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
