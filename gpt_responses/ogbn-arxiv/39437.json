The use of induced subgraphs to characterize these numbers suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also mentions results on b-critical vertices and edges, which are related to connectivity (cs.GT) and algorithms for graph coloring (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
