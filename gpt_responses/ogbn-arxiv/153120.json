Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary category for papers on SVMs. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of dropout, a popular regularization technique in deep learning, which suggests that it may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also includes experiments on real datasets, which suggests that it may be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
