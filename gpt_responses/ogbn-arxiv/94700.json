The approach involves the use of LSTM networks and ensemble models for RUL estimation and predictive uncertainty estimation. This work is primarily focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis, which falls under the scope of several arXiv CS sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
