The paper focuses on recent techniques that treat the shape of 3D objects as points in some high dimensional space where paths describe deformations. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), computer graphics (cs.GR), and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also discusses modeling and exploring continuous shape variability in a collection of 3D models, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
