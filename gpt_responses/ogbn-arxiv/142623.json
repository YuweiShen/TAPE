This falls under the area of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as AFs are a popular formalism in these fields. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of verifying certain semantics, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents a novel concept of compact AFs, which could be of interest to researchers in the area of cryptography (cs.CR) as it relates to the concept of minimalism."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
