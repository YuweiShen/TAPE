The paper also discusses the use of hashing algorithms, which are commonly used in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper presents a novel algorithm for estimating n-gram statistics, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of hashing algorithms, which is a topic related to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
