The focus on the use of type parameters and the construction of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of semantic constraints and the use of a DFA also suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
