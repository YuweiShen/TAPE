The paper presents a 2-stage integer program with only two variables per constraint, which is closely related to directed Diophantine approximation and the mixing set problem. These topics are typically studied in computer science sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
