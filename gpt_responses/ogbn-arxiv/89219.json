This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with secure and reliable data transfer. The proposed system also involves distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS) as it involves multiple nodes generating their own chains and agreeing on a main chain. The paper also discusses a smart transacting algorithm, which falls under the category of databases (cs.DB) as it involves efficient data management. Finally, the paper proposes a locally executable validation scheme, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves developing an algorithm for validating transactions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
