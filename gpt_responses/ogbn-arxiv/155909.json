This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): MARL is a subfield of machine learning, and the paper introduces a toolkit for MARL research.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): MARL is a subfield of AI, and the paper is about designing and customizing AI agents for MARL scenarios.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper is about MARL, which is a subfield of multiagent systems, and the toolkit is designed to support self-play RL and cooperative-competitive hybrid MARL.\n- cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper mentions changing cooperative-competitive agent-interaction, which is related to game theory, and the toolkit is designed to support various MARL platforms, including games.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper is about designing and customizing agents for MARL scenarios, which can be seen as a control problem, and the toolkit is designed to support various MARL platforms, including robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
