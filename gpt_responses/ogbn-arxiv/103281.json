The paper also involves the study of the growth rate or spectral shape of these spectra, which is a topic of interest in functional analysis (cs.FA). The analysis involves the use of certain symmetry properties, which is a common theme in the study of discrete structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves the use of certain statistical techniques to analyze the local weight distribution, which is a topic of interest in the field of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the study of the performance of these codes, which is a topic of interest in the field of network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
