The focus of the paper is on methods that can learn with less supervision, such as semi-supervised learning (cs.LG), multiple instance learning (cs.AI), and transfer learning (cs.MM). Neural networks are also mentioned, which falls under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
