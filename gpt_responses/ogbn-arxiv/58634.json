The paper discusses the detection of primary users (PU) who operate under multiple transmit power levels, which is relevant to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of cognitive algorithms to recognize the power level of the PU, which is relevant to the fields of systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.CR, cs.SY, and cs.AI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
