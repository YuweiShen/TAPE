The paper also discusses extensions to type class resolution, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE) or formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper establishes incompleteness results for fragments of the proof system, which could be relevant to computational logic (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
