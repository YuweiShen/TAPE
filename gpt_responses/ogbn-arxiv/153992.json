Additionally, the paper proposes a method for certifying the robustness of neural networks, which involves solving a semidefinite program, a technique that is commonly used in the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper also discusses the optimization of the certificate along with the network parameters, which is a topic that falls under the category of neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
