This involves information theory concepts such as channel coding and modulation. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems, which are used for high-speed data transmission in multimedia applications. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a novel hybrid analog-digital architecture for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems, which involves designing a digital precoder to improve system performance. This involves signal processing techniques such as filtering and equalization. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems, which are used for high-speed data transmission in wireless networks. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a novel hybrid analog-digital architecture for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems, which involves designing a passive reflect- or transmit-array for the analog front-end to improve scalability and reduce implementational costs. This involves hardware architecture concepts such as antenna design and implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
