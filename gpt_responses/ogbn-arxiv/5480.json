It also involves delayed channel state information, which falls under the category of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper proposes a transmission strategy that relies on delayed knowledge of the outgoing links, which can be considered as a form of spatial information (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the impact of channel state information on the capacity region, which can be related to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
