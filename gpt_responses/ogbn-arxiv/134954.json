The proposed approach involves processing point clouds, publishing waypoints, and optimizing motion planning, which can also be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using heuristic methods to enhance safety, which can be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
