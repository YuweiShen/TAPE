This problem is related to optimal experimentation and dynamic learning, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the asymptotic frequency with which each signal is chosen, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis to derive the optimal path of signal acquisitions, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
