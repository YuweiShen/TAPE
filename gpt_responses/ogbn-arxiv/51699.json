This involves optimizing the auto-correlation and cross-correlation performance of CAZAC sequences, which is a topic related to information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is focused on the NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum (NR-U) of 5G system, which is a networking and internet architecture topic.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the design of mechanisms for reducing CM problems in the frequency domain for PRACH and PUCCH channels in 5G NR, which is a communication and networking topic.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes new mechanisms for reducing CM problems in the frequency domain for PRACH and PUCCH channels in 5G NR, which can be seen as a control problem.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although the paper does not directly relate to multimedia, the use of OFDM and Zadoff-Chu sequences in 5G NR can be considered as a multimedia topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
