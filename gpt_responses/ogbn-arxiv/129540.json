This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-disciplines, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communication (cs.COM). Given the focus on wireless communication and optimization, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories. The consideration of dynamic passive beamforming also suggests cs.SY as a possible category. The use of OFDMA and multiuser diversity may also point to cs.MM and cs.COM, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
