The system uses a spherical camera and image processing techniques, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). The algorithm proposed for selecting the number of images involves optimization, which falls under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The system also involves machine learning techniques for tracking UASs, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
