The paper also introduces a randomized approach to handle larger graphs, which involves analyzing the co-crossing number of vertices, a concept related to graph theory and discrete mathematics (cs.DS, cs.DM). The paper also includes experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, which involves implementing algorithms and analyzing data, falling under the categories of computational science and scientific computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the topic of graph drawing, which is a subfield of graph theory and falls under the category of computer science and discrete mathematics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
