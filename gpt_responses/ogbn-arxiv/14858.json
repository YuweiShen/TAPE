The specialized communication protocol presented in the paper can be used for algorithm evaluation, which is also related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions a reference implementation of the protocol that makes it easy to use in several popular programming languages, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
