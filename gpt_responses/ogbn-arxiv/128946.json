This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) as the authors propose a multi-winner contests mechanism to incentivize participants. The paper also deals with social networks (cs.SOC) as the mechanism is designed for diffusion in social networks. The use of social media and the need for manipulation-resistant mechanisms suggest that the paper could also belong to the categories of cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves numerical experiments on real-world datasets, which could fall under the category of social computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
