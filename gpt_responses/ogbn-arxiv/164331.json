The paper also discusses the decomposition of these functions, which is a topic of interest in information theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of generalized bent and hyperbent functions, and their decompositions. This is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with Boolean functions and their properties, which is a topic of interest in discrete mathematics. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the properties of generalized bent and hyperbent functions, which are important in cryptography. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although this is less likely, the paper may be relevant to social and information networks as Boolean functions are used in network analysis and modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
