Specifically, it proposes a task of turning point identification in movies and introduces a dataset consisting of screenplays and plot synopses annotated with turning points. The paper presents an end-to-end neural network model that identifies turning points in plot synopses and projects them onto scenes in screenplays. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also uses machine learning techniques, so it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval and summarization, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper uses computer vision techniques to project turning points onto scenes in screenplays, so it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
