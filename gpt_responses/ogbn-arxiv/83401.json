Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, which are commonly used in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper involves the analysis of large datasets and the development of a framework for incrementally increasing the number of learned classes, which could fall under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
