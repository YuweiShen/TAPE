The paper also introduces a new algorithm for the practical implementation of successor features in continuous action spaces, which is a subfield of robotics and control systems. The paper's focus on policy improvement and transfer learning suggests that it may fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
