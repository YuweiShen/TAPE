The paper proposes two computationally efficient bootstrapping algorithms for SPI and provides theoretical bounds. RL is a subfield of machine learning, which falls under the Computer Science category. Given the focus on RL and policy improvement, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these sub-categories are also relevant to the topic of RL and policy improvement."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
