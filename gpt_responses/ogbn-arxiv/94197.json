The use of natural language strings and neural networks also points towards cs.CL (Computation and Language) as a likely sub-category. The mention of visual domains and benchmark datasets suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as another possible sub-category. The use of reinforcement learning and joint learning of parameters suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as likely sub-categories.
