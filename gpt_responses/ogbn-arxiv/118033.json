Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses VLSI architecture, which falls under cs.AR (Architecture), and the use of reduced-data-width scheme, which falls under cs.ET (Embedded Systems). The paper also involves sorting algorithms, which can be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and the hardware efficiencies of the proposed designs, which can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
