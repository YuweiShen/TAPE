The paper also discusses the use of probability distributions and secret vectors, which are concepts related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a new asymmetric fingerprinting protocol, which involves the manipulation and analysis of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed scheme in multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
