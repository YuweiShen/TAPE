It also proposes an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block for image classification, fine-grained image classification, action recognition, and person re-identification tasks. Additionally, it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a new approach to interpreting nonlocal-based blocks in neural networks. The paper also involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with image and video data. Finally, it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it proposes a new block for neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
