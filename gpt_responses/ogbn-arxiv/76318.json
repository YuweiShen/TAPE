Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, which is directly relevant to the topic of this paper.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): VLC is a wireless communication technology that can be used for networking and internet architecture. This paper proposes a noise mitigation approach for VLC systems, which is directly relevant to the networking and internet architecture sub-category.\n\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): This paper deals with the communication aspect of VLC systems and proposes a noise mitigation approach. Communication and networking is a broad sub-category that encompasses various aspects of communication systems, including wireless communication technologies like VLC.\n\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Machine learning is a sub-category of computer science that deals with the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data. While this paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it does propose a signal processing method to mitigate noise, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): Systems and control is a sub-category of computer science that deals with the analysis and design of complex systems. While this paper does not explicitly mention systems and control, it does propose a noise mitigation approach for VLC systems, which can be seen as a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
