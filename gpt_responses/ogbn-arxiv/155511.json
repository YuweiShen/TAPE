This involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques such as object detection and feature extraction, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) methods for training the network. The network's application to vehicle detection suggests a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of deep learning implies a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
