The communication complexity of these problems is a key aspect, which makes the paper relevant to the subfield of information theory (cs.IT) and communication complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper also presents a new composition framework for multiparty number-in-hand communication complexity, which could be of interest to researchers in the area of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
