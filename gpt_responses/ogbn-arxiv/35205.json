The paper also proposes a new method for addressing these training challenges in the context of autonomous driving, which falls under the robotics and control subfields (cs.RO, cs.SY). Finally, the paper draws on cognitive experiments in humans to motivate its approach, which suggests a connection to the neuroscience and neural networks subfield (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
