The main problem addressed in the paper is that of optimizing bootstrapping operations in circuits, which involves discrete optimization techniques (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of linear programming and approximation algorithms (cs.IT, cs.CC), and the problem of minimizing the number of bootstrappings in circuits can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
