This tool is specifically targeted at teaching programming concepts that are important in the functional programming paradigm, such as recursion, higher-order functions, pattern-matching, and lazy evaluation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages), which deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages and their associated tools. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of the tool in a tutoring environment, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), which deals with the use of logic and formal methods in computer science education. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the tool's ability to diagnose steps submitted by students and provide feedback, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.ED (Computer Science Education), which deals with the development and evaluation of educational tools and techniques for teaching computer science. \n\nThe paper also mentions that instructors can add or change function definitions without knowledge of the tool's internal implementation, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.SE (Software Engineering), which deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the tool's potential impact on student learning and understanding, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
