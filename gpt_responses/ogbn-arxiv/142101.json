This involves the use of information theory, cryptography, and networking concepts, which are typically covered in the sub-categories of cs.IT, cs.CR, and cs.NI. The paper also involves optimization techniques and system design considerations, which are covered in the sub-categories of cs.SY and cs.MM.
