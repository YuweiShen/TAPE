The paper also focuses on the use of geometric constraints and physical world information, which are important aspects of robotics (cs.RO). The use of deep learning techniques also suggests a possible fit with machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the filtering of false detections, which is a common problem in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
