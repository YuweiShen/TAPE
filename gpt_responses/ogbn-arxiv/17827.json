The paper proposes a novel framework for concept drift detection, which involves statistical hypothesis testing, making it relevant to the subfield of statistics (cs.ST) as well. The paper also uses benchmark datasets from computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS) to evaluate the proposed methods. Finally, the paper discusses the issue of expensive labels, which is a common concern in the subfield of semi-supervised learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
