The paper proposes methods for joint scheduling and power adaptation in the downlink of a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based FRAN, which involves managing interference between users. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper proposes a mixed-integer optimization problem to maximize a network-wide rate-based utility function subject to fronthaul-capacity constraints, which involves optimizing the allocation of resources and power levels. This is a common problem in information theory, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a hybrid centralized/distributed approach to solve the optimization problem, which involves designing a control system that can operate in a partially decentralized manner. This is a common problem in systems and control, which deals with the design and analysis of complex systems. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the advantages of the proposed methods compared to different baseline schemes for different utility functions and network environments, which involves evaluating the performance of multimedia applications in a wireless network. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a feasible decoupled"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
