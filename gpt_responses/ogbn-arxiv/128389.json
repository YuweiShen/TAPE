This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the translation of fault detection properties and mathematical proofs into a formal language used in software validation and verification. This is a key aspect of software engineering.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper uses a 3DOF laboratory helicopter as a testbed for the fault detection methods. This falls under the scope of robotics.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses the use of automatic software verification tools to verify high level functional properties of the code. This is an emerging technology in software engineering.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of nonexecutable annotations in software to express fault detection properties. This falls under the scope of programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
