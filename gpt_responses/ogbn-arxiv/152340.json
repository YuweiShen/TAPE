The use of a proxy, such as a Gaussian Process regressor, is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for approximating complex functions. The paper also discusses the search space for Bayesian networks, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of a proxy can also be seen as a form of optimization, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
