This involves designing a method for Scene Point Cloud Sequence Forecasting (SPCSF) and evaluating it on datasets such as KITTI and nuScenes. The paper also proposes a new object trajectory forecasting pipeline leveraging SPCSFNet and presents a new evaluation procedure and two new metrics to measure the end-to-end performance of the trajectory forecasting pipeline. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
