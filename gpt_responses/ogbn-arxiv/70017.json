The use of beamforming techniques and single-user detection also suggests the possibility of the paper being related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the optimization techniques used in the paper may also be relevant to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
