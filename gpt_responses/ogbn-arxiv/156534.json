The paper also mentions optimization and random walks, which are topics in cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), respectively. The use of convex geometry suggests a connection to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), while the application of the algorithms to various fields suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
