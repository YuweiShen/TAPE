The paper also discusses the challenges faced by using MIMO communication at higher carrier frequencies, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the applications of mmWave in vehicular area networks, ad hoc networks, and wearables, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and augmented reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
