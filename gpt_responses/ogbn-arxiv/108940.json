This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in natural language processing and time-series analysis, indicating a possible connection to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
