The use of a recursive optimization algorithm for real-time estimation of the source location also falls under the scope of robotics.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a discrete-time recursive algorithm for concurrent control and estimation, which is a key area of research in systems and control.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of optimization algorithms and self-odometry for driving an agent to an unknown source can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The optimization criterion used in the paper is based on a least-square cost function, which is a common technique in machine learning.\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision, the use of distance measurements to the target can be considered as a form of visual sensing, which falls under the scope of computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
