Specifically, it focuses on offline signature verification, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) domains. The proposed approach involves transfer learning, which is a popular technique in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for leveraging pre-trained models to improve performance on new tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of support vector machines (SVMs) for classification, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
