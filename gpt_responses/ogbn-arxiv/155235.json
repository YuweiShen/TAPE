These are typical topics in information theory. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video streaming and scalable video coding, which are core topics in multimedia research. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers the transmission of a video stream from a multi-antenna base station to multiple single-antenna users, which involves networking and internet architecture aspects such as channel coding, modulation, and multiple access. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not focus on computer vision or pattern recognition, it deals with video quality and satisfaction, which are relevant to these fields. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint layer selection and quality-based beamforming design to maximize the total utility under a given power budget, which involves system optimization and control aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
