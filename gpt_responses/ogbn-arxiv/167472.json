The paper also introduces a novel adaptation framework that can operate across both task and domains, which involves transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques, which are typically studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with robotics (cs.RO) since the proposed framework can be used for robotic perception tasks. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) since it deals with semantic segmentation, which is a task related to language understanding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
