The library is designed for use in high-energy physics and other research areas, which suggests it may also be relevant to scientific computing (cs.MS). The use of modern asymptotically fast algorithms implies a focus on algorithmic efficiency and optimization, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The mention of a simple API for interacting with the library suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the library may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) if it includes algorithms for manipulating geometric objects represented as polynomials."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
