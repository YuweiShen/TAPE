The paper proposes a self-supervised interpretable framework that can discover causal features to enable easy interpretation of RL agents. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on several Atari 2600 games as well as Duckietown, which is a challenging self-driving car simulator environment. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, since the paper evaluates the proposed method on a self-driving car simulator environment, cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
