This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of reinforcement learning and auxiliary losses, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves image processing and computer vision, as the network learns from both images and sound signals (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses ablation studies, which are often used in statistical learning and data analysis (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
