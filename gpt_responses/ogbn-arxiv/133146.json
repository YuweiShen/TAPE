The paper also discusses the use of optimization techniques (cs.CE) and probabilistic models (cs.AI) to improve the accuracy of interpretable models. Additionally, the paper uses decision trees (cs.DS) and linear models (cs.CR) as examples of interpretable models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
