The paper also discusses the use of coded modulation, which falls under the category of communication (cs.COMM). The paper proposes a new coded modulation paradigm, which involves the use of time-varying space-only codes, and proves full diversity in terms of outage probability, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of LDPC coded systems, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of numerical simulations to corroborate the theoretical proof of full diversity, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
