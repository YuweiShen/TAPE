This falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of first-order logic and default negation, which falls under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). The methodology of forward chaining and grounding on the fly is related to Software Engineering (cs.SE) and the algorithms used in the ASP solver can be related to Data Structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
