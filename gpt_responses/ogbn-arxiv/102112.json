The experiments involve image classification tasks, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with adversarial attacks, which are a security concern in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
