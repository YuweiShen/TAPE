This involves building a catalogue of experience and adjusting the NPC's proficiency with a weapon based on its current performance against an opponent. This work involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as reinforcement learning and machine learning (ML), which are commonly found in the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories. The use of FPS games and NPCs suggests a potential connection to the cs.GT (game theory) sub-category. Additionally, the potential use of computer vision (CV) techniques for analyzing game data and the use of stored learning policies suggests a connection to the cs.CV and cs.SD (software engineering) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
