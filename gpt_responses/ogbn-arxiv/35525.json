The focus is on obtaining upper bounds on the expected cost of control policies across novel environments, which is a problem in the supervised learning setting. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
