This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC), as well as in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) where recommendation systems are often studied. The use of gold tasks to estimate the expected reward of recommending a task to a worker is a statistical inference problem, which falls under the scope of statistical learning (cs.SI). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
