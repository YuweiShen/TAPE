Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of clustering algorithms, which falls under the scope of machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), making cs.CL and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. The proposed approach also involves integrating Arabic language properties, which could fall under the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), making cs.AI and cs.DL possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
