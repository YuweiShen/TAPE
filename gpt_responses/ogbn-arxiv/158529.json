This involves modelling data hierarchically with noisy tiles-rectangles with significantly different density than their parent tile. The paper proposes STIJL, a greedy any-time algorithm for mining good tile trees from binary data. The approach employs the Minimum Description Length principle to identify good trees. The paper's focus on data mining, machine learning, and algorithms suggests that it is most likely to belong to the cs.DM (Data Mining) sub-category. However, the paper's use of machine learning and algorithms also suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper's focus on data modelling and analysis suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of hierarchical modelling and its focus on interpretability suggests that it could belong to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
