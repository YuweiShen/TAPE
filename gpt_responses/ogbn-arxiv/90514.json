This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically involves convolutional neural networks (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and recurrent networks (cs.NE) for optimizing the grouping of neurons. Finally, the paper deals with classification tasks (cs.CL) using deep networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
