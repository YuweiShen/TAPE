This involves optimizing data paths and rate adaptation for delivering video files from HTTP-media servers to DASH clients. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper leverages SDN to optimize network resources and improve video delivery. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with improving QoE metrics in video streaming, which falls under the multimedia category. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a centralized approach for optimizing video delivery, which involves coordination between multiple entities in the network. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves designing an optimization model for maximizing QoE metrics and QoE-fairness, which falls under the systems and control category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve information theory concepts in designing the optimization model for rate adaptation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
