The paper also introduces a new formal notion of risk monotonicity, which is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific instantiations from classification, regression, and density estimation mentioned in the paper suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
