The approach involves constructing a pose-oblivious shape signature and feeding it to a sequence learning framework. The paper uses deep learning techniques such as Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) and CNN-based parallel single person pose estimator (SPPE) for pose estimation. The paper also discusses the use of feature vectors to capture the adjacency configuration in the skeletal pattern. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
