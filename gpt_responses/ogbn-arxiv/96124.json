The use of surrogate losses and derivation of regret bounds are common techniques in the field of online learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the efficiency of algorithms, which is a topic in the field of computer engineering (cs.CE). The use of sequential complexity measures and regressors suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
