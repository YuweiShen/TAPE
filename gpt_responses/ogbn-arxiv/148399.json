It also involves the use of cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access techniques, which are related to cryptography and security (cs.CR) and system and control theory (cs.SY). The implementation of the protocol using Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) involves the use of computer engineering and hardware design (cs.AR). Finally, the protocol involves spectrum allocation and management, which can be related to artificial intelligence and machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
