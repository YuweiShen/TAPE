This topic falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of learning-based and planning-based models, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of real driving data, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the stability of the prediction performance under various scenarios, which could involve control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
