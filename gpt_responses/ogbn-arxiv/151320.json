The paper proposes a new approach for end-to-end video-level representation learning, which involves training deep neural networks (cs.LG) with temporal pyramid pooling (cs.MM) to aggregate frame-level features. The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods and proposes solutions, which involves some level of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural network engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
