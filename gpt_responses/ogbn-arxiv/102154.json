The use of kernel canonical correlation analysis and logistic regression also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of multiple feature representations and the iterative approach may also suggest that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of feature selection and weighting may suggest that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of logistic regression for matching may suggest that it could belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
