The use of StochasticNet radiomic sequencers also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the discovery of custom radiomic features implies an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of binary classification and potential for improving cancer screening and diagnosis suggest a neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the application of radiomics in cancer detection implies an information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
