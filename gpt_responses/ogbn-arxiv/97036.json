The paper specifically focuses on forward privacy and I/O efficiency, which are important considerations in the design of searchable encryption schemes. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of cyber security (cs.CY) and software engineering (cs.SE) due to its focus on practical attacks and implementation of the proposed schemes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
