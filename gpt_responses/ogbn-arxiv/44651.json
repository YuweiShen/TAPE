The algorithm involves a divide-and-conquer strategy and improves upon the previous best combinatorial algorithm. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. The paper's focus on developing a new algorithm for a fundamental problem makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category covers research on the complexity of computational problems and the resources required to solve them. The paper's analysis of the time complexity of the algorithm makes it a possible fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category covers research on algorithms and data structures for geometric problems. The paper's focus on triangle finding in graphs makes it a possible fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): This sub-category covers research on discrete structures and their applications. The paper's focus on Boolean matrix multiplication makes it a possible fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category covers research on the mathematical foundations of information processing. The paper's focus on Boolean matrix multiplication, which is related to information"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
