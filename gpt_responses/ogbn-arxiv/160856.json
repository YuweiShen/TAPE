This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves communication and storage of information. It also relates to distributed computing (cs.DC) as it deals with the coordination of multiple computing nodes. The paper proposes novel achievable and converse bounds for the problem, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the problem involves communication networks (cs.NI) as it deals with the communication links between the computing nodes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
