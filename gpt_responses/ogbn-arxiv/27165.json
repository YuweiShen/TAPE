The paper proposes a new approach called Dynamic Channels, which combines high-level topological path planning with low-level motion planning to solve this problem. This work involves robotics, artificial intelligence, computer vision, control systems, and machine learning, which are all subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
