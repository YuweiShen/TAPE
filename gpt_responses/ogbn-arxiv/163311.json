The introduction of a variance-constrained rate term also suggests that it may belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for optimization suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The application of the algorithm in image set compression suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the investigation of inter-image correlations suggests that it may also belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
