The use of LP relaxations and approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the game theory (cs.GT), machine learning (cs.LG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of alpha-point scheduling, which is a common technique in approximation algorithms for scheduling problems and may be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
