The paper also uses numerical methods to solve the system of equations derived from the operator-valued free probability approach, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the application of this method in calculating the capacity and Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio in large MIMO systems, which is a topic in signal processing and communication (cs.SI). The paper also deals with random matrices, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
