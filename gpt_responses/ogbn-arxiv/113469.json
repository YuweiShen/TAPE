The paper uses a massive computer science bibliographic dataset, which suggests that it may fall under the category of digital libraries (cs.DL). The paper also involves analyzing the collaboration network, which could fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of early citers on long-term scientific impact, which could fall under the categories of social and information networks (cs.SOC) and social computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions using supervised citation prediction models, which could fall under the category of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
