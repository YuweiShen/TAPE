Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a possible sub-category as it may involve image processing for the fabrication process. Control Systems (cs.SY) is another possible sub-category as it deals with optimizing the motion of the robotic system. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible sub-categories as they may involve using optimization algorithms to plan the trajectory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
