The paper also discusses combinatorial properties of the codes, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of composition construction, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper specifically mentions multimedia (cs.MM) in the title, indicating that it is likely to be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
