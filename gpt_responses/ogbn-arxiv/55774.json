The use of prophet inequalities is a well-studied technique in game theory (cs.GT) and information theory (cs.IT), which are also relevant to this paper. The paper also introduces a novel framework for batched prophet inequalities, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
