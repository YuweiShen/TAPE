This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed CAD-Net uses attention-modulated features and global/local contexts to improve object detection performance. This involves the use of AI techniques, making cs.AI a likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The CAD-Net is a deep learning-based network that learns to detect objects in remote sensing images. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely category.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): Object detection in remote sensing images can be useful for robotics applications such as autonomous navigation and mapping. This makes cs.RO a possible category.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Remote sensing images are a type of multimedia data that can be indexed and searched using information retrieval techniques. While this is not the main focus of the paper, it is still relevant, making cs.IR a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
