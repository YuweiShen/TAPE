It could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it involves deep neural networks and optimization. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves training a neural network. The use of perceptual speech metrics suggests it could also be classified under cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing). Finally, the end-to-end framework and optimization suggest it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
