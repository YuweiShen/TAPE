The paper proposes a general scheme for divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms and compares a number of such algorithms using a goodness-of-fit measure. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Data Mining (cs.DM), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
