The paper proposes novel neural autoregressive topic model variants coupled with neural LMs and embeddings priors that outperform state-of-the-art generative TMs in terms of generalization, interpretability, and applicability over diverse datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and computational linguistics. The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which are covered in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper's focus on retrieval and classification also suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of embeddings and neural networks suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
