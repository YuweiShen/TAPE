The attacks involve using ring homomorphisms and statistical tests, which are techniques commonly used in computer science (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the time complexity of the attacks, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.IT). Finally, the paper includes code for the attacks, which suggests a focus on practical implementation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
