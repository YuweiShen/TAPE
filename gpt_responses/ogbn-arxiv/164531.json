The proposed method involves randomization at inference time, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to improve robustness. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of neural networks to attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a method that involves modifying the input to the neural network, which is related to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
