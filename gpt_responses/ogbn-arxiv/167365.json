The paper specifically focuses on the use of gradient descent to optimize over-parameterized neural networks, which is a common approach in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
