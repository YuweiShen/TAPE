The paper proposes a new approach for improving exploration in deep reinforcement learning called Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which rewards agents for visiting as many different states as possible within each episode. This approach can be applied to a wide range of challenging deep reinforcement learning problems, including sparse- and dense-reward tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also uses computer vision techniques to process the game environments, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses game theory concepts such as exploration and exploitation, which could place it in the cs.GT (Game Theory) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for improving exploration, which could be relevant to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category, as exploration is an important problem in robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
