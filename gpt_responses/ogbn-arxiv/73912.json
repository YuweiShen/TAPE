This involves deriving an iterative algorithm analogous to sparse reconstruction algorithms in the context of linear inverse problems. The paper exemplifies the framework with the compressive estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and provides theoretical guarantees of reconstruction. The paper also draws connections between the proposed framework and approximate Hilbert space embedding of probability distributions using random features. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and statistical learning (cs.SD) aspects, which make these sub-categories likely as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
