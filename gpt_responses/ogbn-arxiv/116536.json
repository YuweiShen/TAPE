The use of heuristic-based optimization techniques such as tabu search is also related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the specific channels considered in the paper, such as MIMO and ISI channels, are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
