This involves the use of recurrent neural networks and cognitive psychology-inspired techniques to segment videos into individual, stable segments that share the same semantics. Given that the paper deals with computer vision and machine learning techniques, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new adaptive learning paradigm to reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of cognitive psychology-inspired techniques could also place the paper in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves natural language processing techniques to analyze instructional videos, which could place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which could place it in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
