The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as SVM, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses RST for data preprocessing, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves learning and testing the SVM model, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with improving the accuracy of the detection system, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
