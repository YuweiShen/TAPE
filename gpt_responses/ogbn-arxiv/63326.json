The paper also discusses constructing a simpler decision model for a specific patient, which could fall under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE) or systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on decision-making and problem formulation could also place it in the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
