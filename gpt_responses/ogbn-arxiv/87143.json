The paper introduces novel visualization techniques and an open-source implementation for analyzing connectivity in graphs, which is relevant to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the optimization of the technique for connectomics data analysis, which falls under the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper discusses the use of graphs and adjacency matrices, which are common in the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the analysis of how signals flow through neurons, which is relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
