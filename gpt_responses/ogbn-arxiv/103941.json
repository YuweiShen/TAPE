The construction of saturated graphs with few edges involves combinatorial techniques, which suggests that the paper could also be classified under discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The study of topological graphs also has connections to graph theory (cs.GT) and computational topology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
