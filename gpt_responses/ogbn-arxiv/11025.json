The method involves using domain-specific modeling patterns, which suggests a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The method also involves precomputing closed-form expressions, which suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses reducing analysis time, which suggests a focus on optimization and operations research (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
