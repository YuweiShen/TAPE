The codes are also related to network coding and communication networks (cs.NI). The paper discusses the use of hypergraphs and bipartite graphs, which are topics in discrete mathematics and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional codes, which are a type of error-correcting code used in digital communication (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents examples of woven graph codes, which can be seen as a type of coding scheme for communication networks (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
