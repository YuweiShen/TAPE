The use of Gaussian codebook ensemble and nearest-neighbor decoding suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.MM). The analysis of quantization and sampling also suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SP) and signal/image processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
