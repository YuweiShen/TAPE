The paper proposes a new approach called conditional computation, which is a framework for training neural networks that allows for partial parameter sharing among examples. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
