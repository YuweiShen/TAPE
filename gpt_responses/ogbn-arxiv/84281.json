The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for learning a common optimal subspace, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of different types of visual features, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. However, since the focus of the paper is primarily on computer vision and machine learning, cs.CV and cs.MM are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
