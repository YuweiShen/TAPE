The paper specifically focuses on image datasets, which suggests that it could fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of quality models and oracle queries also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of uncertainty measures, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
