The authors also propose an algebraic representation and a global, polynomial system of equations to solve the problem, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and optimization (cs.DS). The use of convex relaxations to generate approximate solutions suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the problem of solving puzzles can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
