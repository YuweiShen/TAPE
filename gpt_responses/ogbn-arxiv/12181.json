Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves system dynamics and control theory, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of distributed estimators and hierarchical control frameworks suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The paper also involves the use of an auxiliary system with proper parameters, which suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves simulations, which suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
