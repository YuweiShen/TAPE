The paper also considers the optimization of the beamformers, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and RF chains is a common technique in multimedia systems (cs.MM), and the paper discusses the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of mean squared error (MSE), which is a common metric in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
