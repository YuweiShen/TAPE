This approach is commonly used in machine learning for feature selection and regularization. \n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper presents numerical simulations to compare the CLOT control with the conventional EN control, which involves solving optimization problems. This falls under the purview of computational engineering. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the application of the CLOT norm to control the state variable of a system. This is relevant to robotics, where control of the state variable is crucial. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes the use of the CLOT norm, which involves solving optimization problems, to obtain a sparse control. This falls under the purview of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
