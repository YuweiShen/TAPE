This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the algorithm is scalable and avoids the large computational and memory cost of maintaining the full gradient of the current state with respect to the parameters, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions preliminary tests on a simple task, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
