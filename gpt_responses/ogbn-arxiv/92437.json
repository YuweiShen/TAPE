The paper also introduces a novel formulation of a problem in cryptography, which falls under the category of cryptographic protocols (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of its results for the design of backdoored random oracles, which is a topic in the intersection of cryptography (cs.CR) and complexity theory (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
