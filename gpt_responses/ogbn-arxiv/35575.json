Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also uses ideas from robust optimization and test-time input aggregation, which are related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of first-order methods in finding worst-case perturbations, which is related to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
