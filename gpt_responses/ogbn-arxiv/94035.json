The paper proposes a new approach to solve this problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the computer vision (cs.CV), computer graphics (cs.GR), and computational geometry (cs.CG) communities. The paper also uses probabilistic modeling, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM) and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
