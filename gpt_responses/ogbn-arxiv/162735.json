This involves addressing challenges such as movement artifacts and electromyography signals. The paper also focuses on the use of ear-EEG, which is a hardware issue. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of brain-computer interfaces, which falls under the sub-category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper also discusses the validation of the signals with steady-state visual evoked potential, which falls under the sub-category cs.BIO (Computational Biology)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
