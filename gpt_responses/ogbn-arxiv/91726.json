The paper proposes a general-purpose approach for learning a question-dependent, structured reasoning process over images from language, which suggests that it could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of language in the visual reasoning process, which could relate to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for achieving state-of-the-art results, which could relate to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
