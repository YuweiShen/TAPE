The paper presents an improvement to the previous best result, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
