The specific type of generative model used is a conditional autoregressive model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The model is used to generate frames, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) is also relevant. The planning approach used is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
