The paper also discusses the use of probabilities to express uncertainty, which is a topic in statistics and information theory (cs.SI). The proposed framework involves generating initial probability estimates and using a calibration training set, which are techniques commonly used in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper introduces a new calibration method based on a shallow neural network, which is a topic in information theory and machine learning (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
