The use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) is the main focus of the paper, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the joint design of beamformers and AN covariance matrix, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The optimization problem formulation and algorithm development are related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the simulation results involve the use of multiple antennas, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
