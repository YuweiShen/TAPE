The proposed method employs a fuzzy commitment protocol to ensure the security of biometric templates. Therefore, it is highly likely that this paper belongs to the cs.CR sub-category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - Biometric authentication systems heavily rely on computer vision and pattern recognition techniques to extract and match biometric features. The paper proposes a hybrid biometric template protection approach that utilizes feature transformation techniques. Therefore, it is also likely that this paper belongs to the cs.CV sub-category.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Biometric authentication systems often involve multimedia data such as images, videos, and audio recordings. The paper proposes a new random orthonormal project technique to reduce the computational complexity of the system while preserving accuracy. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the cs.MM sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed hybrid biometric template protection approach involves feature transformation techniques, which are often used in machine learning. Therefore, it is also possible that this paper belongs to the cs.LG sub-category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper employs a fuzzy commitment protocol to ensure the security of biometric templates. Fuzzy commitment is a cryptographic primitive that"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
