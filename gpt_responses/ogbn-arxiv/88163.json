This involves creating a second reward function that recognizes previously seen state sequences and rewards those by novelty, which is measured using autoencoders that have been trained on state sequences from previously discovered policies. This work involves machine learning techniques such as policy gradient algorithms and autoencoders, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The tasks used in the experiments involve navigation, reaching, and locomotion, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper also discusses the effectiveness of the approach on deceptive tasks, which can be related to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
