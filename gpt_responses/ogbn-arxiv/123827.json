Computer vision is a key component in this research area.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on cross-modal retrieval applications, which is a subfield of information retrieval. The proposed method aims to improve the performance of similarity search in multimedia retrieval applications.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multimedia retrieval applications, which involve multiple modalities such as text and image. This subcategory is relevant to the proposed method.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an end-to-end learning framework with deep neural networks for feature learning and hash-code learning. This involves machine learning techniques and is relevant to this subcategory.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with text-image modalities and involves natural language processing techniques for text feature learning. This subcategory is also relevant to the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
