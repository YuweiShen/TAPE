This falls under the scope of machine learning, specifically deep learning.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Anomaly detection on attributed networks is a common problem in social and information networks, where the goal is to identify nodes that deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes. The paper specifically mentions social spammer detection as an application of their proposed method, which falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed method involves the use of autoencoders, which are a type of neural network. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of attention mechanisms in the structure encoder, which is a common technique in neural networks. This falls under the scope of neural and evolutionary computing.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Anomaly detection is a common problem in network security, where the goal is to identify malicious nodes or activities.
