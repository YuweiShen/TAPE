This could be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing): Unlikely, but the abbreviation \"SD\" could be interpreted as \"Signal and Data\" which could be relevant to the study of cyclic codes. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the study of cyclic codes over the ring $R$ could have implications for the complexity of certain coding problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
