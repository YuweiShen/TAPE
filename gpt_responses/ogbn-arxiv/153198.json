This suggests that the paper belongs to the computer security (cs.CR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed modification involves changes to the authentication centers and SIMs, indicating that the paper may also belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories.
