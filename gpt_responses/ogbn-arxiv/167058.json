Additionally, the paper utilizes semantic information in the form of hash-tags, which is also a multimedia-related aspect.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a data augmentation based domain adaptation strategy, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper modifies the embedding function iteratively, which is also a machine learning-related aspect.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper utilizes semantic word2vec space as a common subspace to embed video features, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval. Additionally, the paper incorporates noisy semantic information in the form of hash-tags, which is also an information retrieval-related aspect.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper utilizes semantic word2vec space and hash-tags as a form of semantic information, which is a common aspect in natural language processing. Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of unsupervised action classification, which is a language-related aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
