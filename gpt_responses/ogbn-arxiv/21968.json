Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple pivots in quicksort, which is a common algorithmic technique and could also be classified under \"Algorithms\" (cs.AL). The paper also includes discussions of cache behavior and array access patterns, which could fall under \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT) or \"Numerical Analysis\" (cs.NA). Finally, the paper includes experimental results and analysis of sample-based pivot selection, which could be classified under \"Discrete Mathematics\" (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
