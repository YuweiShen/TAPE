It proposes a framework for modeling the temporal evolution of the object's appearance/motion using a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) and using it as a dynamic template for tracking objects in novel videos. The paper also applies the framework to the problem of human action tracking. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) are also possible sub-categories as they deal with tracking and recognition of objects in videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
