The use of sketches and the desire for fast algorithms suggest that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The mention of concentration bounds and probabilistic guarantees suggest that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the mention of applications in computer vision and similarity search suggest that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
