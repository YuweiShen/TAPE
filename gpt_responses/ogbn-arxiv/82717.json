The paper proposes a novel training strategy for deep face detectors, which involves learning small faces on hard images, which requires machine learning techniques, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of intuition and reasoning to develop the proposed method, which is a characteristic of artificial intelligence research, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several datasets, which involves measuring performance metrics, such as average precision, which is a characteristic of multimedia research, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of image retrieval techniques to evaluate the proposed method, which is a characteristic of information retrieval research, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
