It also discusses the performance and understanding issues of the Paxos algorithm, which is a well-known consensus algorithm used in operating systems (cs.OS) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new abstract solution to consensus, which can be applied to various consensus algorithms, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
