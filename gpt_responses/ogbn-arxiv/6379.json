This suggests that the paper could fall under multiple arXiv CS sub-categories, including Multimedia (cs.MM), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SD), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), and Information Theory (cs.IT). Among these, cs.MM and cs.NI are the most likely categories, as they directly relate to video streaming and network behavior, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
