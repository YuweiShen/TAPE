The paper also discusses interference cancellation and decoding complexity reduction, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Communications (cs.COMM) and Signal Processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper focuses on the uplink of a MIMO multiple access channel (MAC), which is related to the sub-categories of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
