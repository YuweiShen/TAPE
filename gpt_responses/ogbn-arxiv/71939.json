The use of hard negative mining and iterative updates also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) focus. The evaluation of the proposed method on the FDDB dataset indicates a multimedia (cs.MM) aspect. Finally, the use of background examples and the potential for false positives suggests a potential focus on computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
