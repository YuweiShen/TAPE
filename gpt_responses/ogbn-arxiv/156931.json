The PINN method is a type of machine learning method that combines neural networks with physical laws or constraints. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper addresses the problem of long-time integration of nonlinear SPDEs and proposes a numerical method based on PINNs and DO/BO methods. The paper also presents several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n- cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of uncertainty propagation in physical systems modeled by SPDEs, and proposes a method based on PINNs and DO/BO methods to quantify the uncertainty. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a new numerical method for solving SPDEs, which is relevant to many areas of computational engineering, finance, and science where SPDEs are commonly used to model physical systems with stochasticity. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper presents a new software implementation of the proposed method based on PINNs and DO/BO methods, which can be used to solve time"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
