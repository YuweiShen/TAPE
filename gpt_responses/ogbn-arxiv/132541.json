The paper also provides a program summary and implementation details in C++, which suggests a focus on computational methods. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), followed by cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.CE (Computational Engineering), cs.MS (Mathematical Software), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
