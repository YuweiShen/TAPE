Additionally, the use of data augmentation is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) tasks, which are also relevant to this work. The paper also mentions the use of the tangent Hessian, which is a tool commonly used in optimization and numerical analysis, suggesting a possible connection to the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
