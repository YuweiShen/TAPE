Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely category. The paper also involves noise and signal processing, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Sound and Image Processing). Additionally, the paper mentions the Gaussian case, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses capacity regions, which could be related to cs.COM (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
