Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the efficiency of the construction process, which suggests that it may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the use of an RNase enzyme to destroy tiles is a form of control theory, which could place the paper in cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
