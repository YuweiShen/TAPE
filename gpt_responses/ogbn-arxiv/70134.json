The experiments involve training the model with different forms of Dropout, which is a common regularization technique used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of Batch Normalization, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning models for improving performance (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves experimentation with different forms of Dropout scheduling, which is a technique used in neural networks for improving training efficiency (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) in the form of interpreting and analyzing the results of the experiments, which falls under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
