The paper uses a standard predictive model inspired by collaborative filtering, which is a popular technique in machine learning and recommender systems. The problem of optimizing relevance feedback is also related to the problem of maximizing user engagement, which is a common problem in human-computer interaction. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
