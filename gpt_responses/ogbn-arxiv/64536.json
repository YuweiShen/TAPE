The focus on truthful mechanisms and approximation ratios suggests a connection to mechanism design (cs.GT) and approximation algorithms (cs.DS). The use of randomised mechanisms and ties in preference lists may also relate to probabilistic methods (cs.PR) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the interpretation of the problem in terms of the secretary problem suggests a connection to decision theory (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
