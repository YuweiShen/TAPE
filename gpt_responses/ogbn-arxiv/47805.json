This topic is closely related to database systems (cs.DB) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses experiments with XQuery and PL/SQL database systems, which further supports the relevance to cs.DB and cs.PL. Additionally, the paper addresses issues related to software engineering (cs.SE), machine learning (cs.LG), and cryptography (cs.CR) in the context of query defunctionalization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
