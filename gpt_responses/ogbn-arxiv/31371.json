The software also allows for programming and control of the robots, which could fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the ability to transfer control programs to real robots could fall under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper mentions that the software is well documented and continuously maintained, which could indicate a focus on software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
