The paper also discusses the use of language models in caption generation, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL). The experiments conducted involve varying image representation quality, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of datasets for automatic captioning, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
