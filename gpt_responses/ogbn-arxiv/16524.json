The use of massive MIMO systems and millimeter waves also suggests a potential connection to system and control theory (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper introduces a new physical model for wave propagation, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of electromagnetics and optics (cs.PHYS). Finally, the use of parabolic wave models and comparison with classical algorithms suggests a potential connection to multimedia systems and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
