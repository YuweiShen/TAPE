The paper focuses on the use of mutual information-based method for self-recognition, which discovers visual \"control points\" on the robot body within a few seconds of exploratory interaction, and these control points in turn are then used for visual servoing. The paper demonstrates the method on visually-guided 3D point reaching, trajectory following, and robot-to-robot imitation. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics and Automation), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
