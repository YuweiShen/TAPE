The paper proposes novel loss functions that are robust to corruptions in training sets, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes to learn to super-resolve images to match human perceptions, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses a large clinical dataset, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new loss function, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
