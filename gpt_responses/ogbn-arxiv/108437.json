Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses strategies to reduce over-fitting, which falls under the category of machine learning, making cs.LG and cs.NE likely sub-categories. The use of neural networks for image recognition is also discussed, which falls under the category of computer vision, making cs.CV a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the problem of solving RPM with unsupervised and explainable strategies, which falls under the category of natural language processing, making cs.CL a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
