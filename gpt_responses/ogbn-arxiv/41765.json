The use of deep neural networks for prediction and control also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The quadrotor's dynamics and control system also involve systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of on-board sensors and image processing for control suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
