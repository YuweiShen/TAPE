The use of statistical experiments and matrix ordering also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of bit-error rate performance comparison suggests a connection to networked systems (cs.NI) and computer communication (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
