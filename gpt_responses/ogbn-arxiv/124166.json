This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a transmission strategy that creates side-information at the weaker user, which falls under the category of source coding (cs.SI). The use of feedback in the transmission strategy also falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the X-Channel and the two-unicast problem, which are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
