The paper also discusses the prioritization of different tiers of cells, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY) and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper proposes low-complexity algorithms for power update strategies, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) since efficient power allocation is important for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
