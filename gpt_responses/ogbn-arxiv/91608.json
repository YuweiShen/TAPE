The paper proposes a proof that the commonly used non-convex objective function for positive semidefinite matrix completion has no spurious local minima, which means that all local minima must also be global. This result has significant implications for optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent, which can provably solve positive semidefinite matrix completion with arbitrary initialization in polynomial time. The paper's focus on optimization and machine learning makes it likely to belong to the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
