The paper proposes a method for continual learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) that focuses on learning from a stream of data. The paper also involves training neural networks (cs.NE) and fine-tuning their parameters (cs.AI) for better performance. Finally, the paper discusses the resource efficiency of the proposed method, which could be relevant to the subfield of software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
