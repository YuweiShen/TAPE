The paper also discusses the use of synthetic data and weak supervision, which are both relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The integration of depth-based adaptation and weak supervision is also relevant to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of contour-based schemes, which is relevant to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
