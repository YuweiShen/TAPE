This involves the use of Coq proof assistant and SSReflect extension, which are tools commonly used in the field of logic and automated reasoning (cs.LO). The paper also mentions applications in optical character recognition and analysis of point cloud data, which are topics in computer graphics (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS) respectively. The use of algorithms and mathematical theory in the paper suggests that it could also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
