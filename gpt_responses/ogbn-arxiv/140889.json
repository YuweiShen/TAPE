The paper also discusses the security and privacy implications of multi-client access to ORAM. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) because it proposes a new data structure for ORAM that allows for parallel access by multiple clients. The paper discusses the design and implementation of this data structure and evaluates its performance using experimental results. \n\nAdditionally, the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.DB (Databases) because it deals with the storage and retrieval of data in a database-like system. The paper discusses the challenges of implementing ORAM in a distributed database and proposes a solution that allows for parallel access by multiple clients. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) because it deals with the challenges of implementing ORAM in a distributed system with multiple clients. The paper proposes a solution that allows for parallel access by multiple clients and evaluates its performance using experimental results. \n\nFinally, the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control) because it deals with the design and implementation of a system for ORAM that allows for parallel"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
