The use of deep reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop the policy suggests that it could also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques to detect and track pedestrians, which could place it under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. Finally, the paper's focus on autonomous navigation in a complex environment suggests that it could also fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
