Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves graph theory concepts such as dominating sets, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem of deciding if a given set of edges can be inserted into a simple drawing is shown to be NP-complete, which is a complexity theory result, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the maximization version of the problem, which is APX-hard, indicating that it could be relevant to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
