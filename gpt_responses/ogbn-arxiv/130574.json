The paper proposes a regularized similarity learning formulation and establishes generalization bounds for it. The paper also shows that a good generalization of the learnt similarity function guarantees a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Given these points, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, since the paper also deals with image classification (as mentioned in the abstract), cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
