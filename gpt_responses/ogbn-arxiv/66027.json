The use of bitprobes suggests that the paper may belong to the category of data structures (cs.DS). The problem of storing and querying a subset can also be seen as a problem in coding theory (cs.IT) or cryptography (cs.CR). The use of adaptive algorithms may also suggest a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
