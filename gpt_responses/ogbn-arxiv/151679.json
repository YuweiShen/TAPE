The paper also discusses methods for measuring and reducing bias, which are relevant to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of word lists from social psychology applications suggests a potential connection to the subfield of social informatics (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on building trust in AI systems could be relevant to the subfield of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
