The use of finite state machines (FSMs) for inference is a novel approach that could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper also discusses label dependency modeling, which is relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
