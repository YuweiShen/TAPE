Other possible sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these areas are also relevant to the topic of parallel DNN training."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
