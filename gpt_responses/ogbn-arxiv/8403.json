Additionally, the identification of isomorphic propositions has applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as it can help reduce redundancy in knowledge representation. The paper also discusses consistency, which is a fundamental concept in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the development of a proof language for this logic falls under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
