The proposed method involves modeling kinship relationships between faces, which is a common topic in CV research. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of an inheritance module and attribute enhancement module, which are both common techniques in AI research. The paper also involves some graphics (GR) techniques for controlling age and gender. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on public benchmark databases, which is a common practice in multimedia (MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
