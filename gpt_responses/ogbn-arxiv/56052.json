The paper also proposes a solution to reduce the overhead of mmWave beam training, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and robotics (cs.RO) concepts. The use of sensors and cameras for object detection and range mapping is related to control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
