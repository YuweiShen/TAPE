This involves deconvolution and successive reconstruction of 2-D planes along 3 independent axes of the 3-D phase image in Fourier domain. The method is tested on simulated phantom and human data and compared with existing QSM reconstruction methods. The paper involves image processing and signal processing techniques, which are commonly found in the computer vision (cs.CV), information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), multimedia (cs.MM), and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories of arXiv CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
