The paper also addresses the issue of limited annotated video data, which could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. Additionally, the proposed data augmentation technique involves simulating video training data, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper proposes a faster method for video saliency detection, which could be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
