The evaluation is based on the L1 distinguishability criterion, which is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and the modified mutual information criterion, which is a measure of the correlation between two random variables. These criteria are often used in the analysis of cryptographic primitives. The paper also mentions smoothing of entropy, which is a technique commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the security in different settings, which could be relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
