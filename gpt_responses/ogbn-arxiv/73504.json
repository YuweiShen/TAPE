The paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) method. This method has been widely used in the field of optimization and has recently been applied to parameter recovery problems in unsupervised learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
