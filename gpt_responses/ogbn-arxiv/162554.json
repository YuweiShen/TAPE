This can be seen as a problem related to social and information networks. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithm to find the set of largest subdivisions that have a common model for population-income prediction. This can be seen as a problem related to data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of the proposed framework to combat poverty and other issues by supporting policy makers to establish policies regarding any other dependent variable beyond incomes. This can be seen as a problem related to computational engineering, finance, and science. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework that uses regression analysis and minimum description length (MDL) to find a set of largest areas that have common indicators, which can be used to predict household incomes efficiently.
