The paper also discusses a GPSSM-based reinforcement learning framework, which is relevant to the artificial intelligence and robotics communities. The paper's focus on dynamical systems and trajectory optimization makes it relevant to the systems and control community. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
