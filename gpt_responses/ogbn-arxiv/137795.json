The paper also discusses practical issues such as power transfer efficiency and safety, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of backscatter antennas and analog spatial decoupling involves electromagnetic theory (cs.EM), while the design of spiky waveforms is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
