The paper proposes joint privacy-channel coding retrieval schemes that exploit the linearity of the channel while using the Compute and Forward (CF) coding scheme. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, since the paper deals with privacy, it is also likely to belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also involves coding and decoding techniques, which makes it relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to PIR over a MAC, which could be of interest to researchers in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
