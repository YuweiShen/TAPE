The technical implementation of the framework involves working with programming languages and toolkits, which could also fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the framework's ability to be deployed over a network suggests a potential connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
