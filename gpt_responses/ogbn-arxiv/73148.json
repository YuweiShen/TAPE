This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering human factors (cs.HC) and coordination constraints (cs.RO) in the design of transfer-of-control strategies. Finally, the paper presents a mathematical model and uses Markov Decision Processes to select an optimal strategy, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
