The paper specifically focuses on conducting low overhead removal of redundant neurons during the training phase, which is a technique that can be applied to various types of Deep Learning models, making it relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision (cs.CV), and Neural Networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of parameters, which is a topic related to Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
