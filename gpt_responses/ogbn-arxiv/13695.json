Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel approach that integrates both local and global information, which involves machine learning techniques such as graph convolutional networks and attention mechanisms. This suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, entity linking is related to information retrieval (IR) and databases (DB), so cs.IR and cs.DB are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
