This approach involves generating a suppressing signal that is added to the OFDM symbol to reduce the PAPR and OOB power leakage. Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, which is relevant to the proposed approach in this paper. \n\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): OFDM is a widely used modulation technique in wireless communication systems, and the proposed approach in this paper is aimed at improving the performance of OFDM-based systems by reducing the PAPR and OOB power leakage. This makes the paper relevant to the communications and networking sub-category. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed approach in this paper involves generating a suppressing signal that is added to the OFDM symbol to reduce the PAPR and OOB power leakage. This approach requires control over the signal processing and transmission, which is relevant to the systems and control sub-category. \n\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed approach in this paper is aimed at improving the performance of OFDM-based systems, which are widely used in wireless communication networks. This makes the paper relevant to the networking and internet"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
