The algorithm is based on chaotic maps, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the applicability of the algorithm to image processing (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
