This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also proposes a new approach to tracking by detection, which involves using the appearance metric to propose detections when the detector fails, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses the MOT16 dataset, which is a benchmark for multiple object tracking, and evaluates the performance of the proposed method in terms of online, real-time approaches, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
