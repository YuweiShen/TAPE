The data can also be used for humanoid robotics (cs.RO) and virtual reality and gaming (cs.LG) applications. The paper mentions the use of electromyography sensors, which could potentially involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for muscle activity analysis. Finally, the data can be used for health-care-related studies, which could involve machine learning and neural networks (cs.NE) for disease recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
