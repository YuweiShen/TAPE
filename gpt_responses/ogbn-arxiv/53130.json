The use of multi-modal data transformations also suggests a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates its method on downstream classification tasks, which could fall under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the use of a contrastive loss function for training could also suggest a fit for the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
