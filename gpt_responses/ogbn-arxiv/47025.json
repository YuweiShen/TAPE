The problem is motivated by delay-critical video conferencing using inter-datacenter networks, which suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of computer networks (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also proposes algorithms with time complexity and approximation guarantees, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
