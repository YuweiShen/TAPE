Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely category. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories as POMDPs are a popular modeling framework in these fields. cs.RO (Robotics) is another possible category as POMDPs are used in robot navigation and decision making. Finally, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a possible category as the paper discusses approximate methods for solving POMDPs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
