The use of COQ, a proof assistant, suggests a focus on logic and formal methods, which is reflected in the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of dependent types, which is a topic that falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.PL (Programming Languages).
