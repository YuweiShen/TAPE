This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to training VQA models using automatically obtained supervision, which involves machine learning (cs.AI), optimization (cs.LG), and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
