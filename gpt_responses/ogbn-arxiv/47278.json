The use of hierarchical and periodic specifications also suggests a possible connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the fact that the problems considered are PSPACE-hard may indicate a link to the area of logic and computation (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
