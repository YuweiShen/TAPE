This involves image analysis and medical imaging, which are typically covered in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on medical applications and the analysis of medical images, which are covered in the medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-category.
