The paper also discusses the impact of channel correlations on the performance of FBMC, which is a topic of interest in the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new filter design method for FBMC, which could be of interest to researchers in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
