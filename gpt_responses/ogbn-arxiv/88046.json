The model considers scheduling objectives from the perspectives of economy, environment, and users, and employs a heuristic optimization algorithm to find a well-distributed set of Pareto-optimal solutions. The paper also develops a consumer satisfaction indicator to measure the quality of user experience. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are systems and control (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and emerging technologies (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper involves software engineering (cs.SE) and computer engineering (cs.CE) aspects in the simulation results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
