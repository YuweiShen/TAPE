Specifically, the paper proposes a method for online meta-learning by parallel algorithm competition. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category is the most likely because the paper deals with a machine learning problem, namely the adaptation of meta-parameters in reinforcement learning algorithms.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category is also likely because the paper deals with a problem that is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence, namely the optimization of reinforcement learning algorithms.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category is relevant because the paper deals with deep reinforcement learning algorithms, which are based on neural networks.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category is relevant because the paper deals with the optimization of control policies in reinforcement learning, which is a topic that falls under the field of systems and control.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category is relevant because the paper deals with the optimization of control policies, which is a topic that is relevant to robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
