The paper uses stochastic geometry to derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability, which is a common approach in the field of information theory. The paper also discusses power allocation and target data rates, which are important aspects of network infrastructure and system and control theory. The paper focuses on cognitive radio networks, which fall under the category of cognitive radio and networking. Finally, the paper discusses the potential benefits of NOMA for multimedia applications, which is relevant to the field of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
