The paper also makes use of deep learning techniques (cs.MM) to learn an encoding of images into a high-dimensional feature space that captures visual aesthetics. The use of multi-user agreements to assemble a large dataset of images also involves aspects of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses applications of their approach to mobile devices and video key-frame extraction, which involve aspects of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
