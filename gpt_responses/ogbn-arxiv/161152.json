The paper describes an algorithm that recovers a decomposition of the object into approximately rigid parts, the location of the parts in the different object instances, and the articulated object skeleton linking the parts. This involves techniques from computer vision (3D range data, segmentation), robotics (articulated object models), machine learning (unsupervised learning, EM algorithm), and graphics (meshes). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves robotics-related techniques such as articulated object models and non-rigid registration, so cs.RO (Robotics) is also a likely sub-category. The paper uses the EM algorithm for segmentation, which is a machine learning technique, so cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category. The paper also involves graphical models, which is a topic in computer science theory, so cs.GR (Computer Science and Game Theory) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves 3D meshes, which is a topic in multimedia, so cs.MM (Multimedia) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
