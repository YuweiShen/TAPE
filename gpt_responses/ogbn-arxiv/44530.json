Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a new network architecture for feature aggregation, which involves learning from pre-trained embeddings. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it involves learning from data. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, which could also place it under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the issue of overfitting, which is a common problem in machine learning, suggesting that it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with the issue of noise in video frames, which could place it under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
