The problem of distance labeling also has connections to graph theory and combinatorics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for distance labeling, which could be of interest to researchers in network engineering (cs.NE) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
