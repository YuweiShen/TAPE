The paper focuses on improving the performance of lightweight semantic segmentation models, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method involves using asymmetric convolutions to compensate for information loss due to dilated convolution, which is a technique that is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses modifications to existing segmentation frameworks, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
