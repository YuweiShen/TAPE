This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture research.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper does not focus on hardware architecture, but it does discuss the integration of future networking technologies with 5GC, which may involve hardware considerations.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not focus on cryptography and security, but it does discuss the extensions to 5GC's control and user planes to support Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sessions from ICN, which may involve security considerations.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper does not focus on distributed, parallel, and cluster computing, but it does discuss the integration of ICN with 5GC, which may involve distributed computing considerations.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not focus on multimedia, but it does discuss the value of enabling ICN within 5GC for two important network services, one of which targets mobile edge computing for a connected car use case, which may involve multimedia considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
