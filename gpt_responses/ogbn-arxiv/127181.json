The paper presents a new approach to the problem that is query-set independent and provides accurate answers while meeting privacy constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also includes experimental results on real datasets from Netflix and Facebook, which further supports its relevance to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
