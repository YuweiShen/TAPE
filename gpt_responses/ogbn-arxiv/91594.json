The proposed algorithmic framework is based on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization, which are techniques used in information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method in THz imaging, which falls under the category of sensing and imaging (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
