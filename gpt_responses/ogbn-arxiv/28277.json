It proposes a novel paradigm for rate selection and power adaptation based on maximal ratio combining. This involves optimizing the transmission rates and powers of devices to maximize the overall throughput of the network. This falls under the purview of information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of multiple access schemes for networks with a large number of active devices.
