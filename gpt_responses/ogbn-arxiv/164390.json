Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also involves bibliometric and scientific publication mining, which suggests a possible fit with cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The analysis of keynotes, workshops, conference organizers and sponsors, tutorials, identification of prolific authors, computation of citation impact of papers and contributing authors, internal and external collaboration, university and industry participation and collaboration, measurement of gender imbalance, topical analysis, yearly author churn and program committee characteristics suggest possible fits with cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
