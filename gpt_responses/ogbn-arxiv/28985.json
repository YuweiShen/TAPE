The use of hashing methods for approximate nearest neighbor search is also a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for learning effective binary codes, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with multi-label image retrieval, which is a sub-topic of multimedia (cs.MM) and involves the use of semantic annotations and visual-semantic bridges, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
