The paper also uses sparse optimization techniques, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of random sampling and theoretical guarantees on recovery rates suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) component to the paper. Finally, the paper deals with datasets generated by various differential equations, which falls under the category of dynamical systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
