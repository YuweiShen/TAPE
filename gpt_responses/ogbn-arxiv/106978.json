The use of lattice-based constructions is also a common theme in the cryptography community, which falls under the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for cryptanalysis, which could potentially fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
