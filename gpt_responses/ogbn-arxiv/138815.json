Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also incorporates rich syntactic and semantic embeddings, which suggests relevance to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of neural networks for modeling complex non-linear interactions points towards Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
