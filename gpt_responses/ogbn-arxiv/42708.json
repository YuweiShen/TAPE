This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the selection of design-SNR and input SNR, which are related to system design and optimization, falling under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between data rate and BER performance, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
