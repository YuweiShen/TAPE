This is a common problem in machine learning, where noisy and non-smooth data is often encountered. \n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a numerical algorithm for solving variational inequalities, which is a topic in numerical analysis. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a new algorithm for solving a specific type of problem, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper does not fit neatly into any specific sub-category, and could be considered as falling under the catch-all category of \"Other Computer Science\". \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses the concept of Bregman divergences, which is a topic in information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
