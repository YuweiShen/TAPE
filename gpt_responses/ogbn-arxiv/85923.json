This is a key area of research in distributed and parallel computing. \n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper focuses on the pipelined preconditioned conjugate gradient (PPCG) method and its variants, which are numerical methods for solving linear systems. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes extensions to existing algorithms to make them resilient against node failures while preserving their communication-hiding properties. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for communication and fault tolerance. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper addresses the issue of system resilience against node failures in large-scale parallel computers, which is a key concern in systems and control research. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes modifications to existing software (the PPCG solver and its variants) to make them resilient against node failures. This involves software engineering techniques such as code modification and testing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
