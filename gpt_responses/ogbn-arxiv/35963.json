This involves examining the effects of a technological design intervention introducing automated attribution of remixes on users' reactions to being remixed. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing, including the impact of technology on society and culture. The paper's focus on the role of attribution in shaping user reactions to content reuse in a large user-generated content community aligns with this sub-category. \n\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. The paper's examination of the effects of a technological design intervention introducing automated attribution of remixes on users' reactions to being remixed aligns with this sub-category. \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis and modeling of social and information networks, including online communities and social media platforms. The paper's focus on the Scratch online community, a social media platform where hundreds of thousands of young people share and remix animations and video games, aligns with this sub-category. \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the computational aspects"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
