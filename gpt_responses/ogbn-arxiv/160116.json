The scheme involves the use of mathematical concepts such as elliptic surfaces and Mordell elliptic curves, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The encryption scheme also involves the use of substitution boxes, which are commonly used in multimedia security (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
