The paper also discusses the storage overhead reduction in PIR protocols, which is a security-related issue (cs.CR). The construction of PIR codes involves coding theory, specifically the extension of codes, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The proposed algorithm for finding good PIR codes involves computational complexity, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents numerical results, which involves simulations and data analysis, and thus falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
