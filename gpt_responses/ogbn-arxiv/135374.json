The proposed methods involve parameter sharing, balancing extensions, structured sparsity, and distance metric learning, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
