This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category, which deals with techniques for searching and retrieving information from large datasets. Additionally, the paper mentions applications such as spell correction and data de-duplication, which are also relevant to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category. \n\nThe paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate fixed-length vector embeddings for a dataset of strings, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category, which deals with the development of algorithms and models for learning from data. \n\nThe paper also mentions theoretical analysis to justify the use of CNN instead of other structures, which suggests that it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions that the proposed method can be applied to image data, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, which deals with the development of algorithms and models for analyzing and understanding visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
