This involves using haptic feedback and transforming the environment to known situations. These concepts are closely related to robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper evaluates the approach in pick-and-place scenarios, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
