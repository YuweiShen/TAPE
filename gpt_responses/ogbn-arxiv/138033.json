Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the modulation of data on optical intensities, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of LEDs and photodiodes, which are components of communication systems and signal processing (cs.COMM). The paper also mentions the limited field of view of photodiodes, which is related to optics (cs.OT). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for high data rates, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
