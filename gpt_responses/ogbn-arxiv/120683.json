This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically probabilistic modeling.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on crowdlearning in social media and web platforms, where users learn from and assess each other's contributions. This falls under the domain of social and information networks.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the assessment measures used in crowdlearning sites, such as upvotes and likes, which are similar to relevance judgments used in information retrieval. Additionally, the paper presents a scalable estimation method to fit the model parameters from millions of recorded events, which involves processing and analyzing large amounts of data, a common task in information retrieval.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the behavior of users in crowdlearning sites, such as their learning and contributing patterns, and how the platform design affects their engagement. This falls under the domain of human-computer interaction.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves analyzing and modeling user-contributed knowledge and assessments, which are expressed in natural language. Additionally, the paper discusses the value of knowledge and how it evolves over time, which falls under the domain of computation and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
