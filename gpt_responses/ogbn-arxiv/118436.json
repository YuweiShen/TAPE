The paper also discusses the weight spectral shape function of the code ensemble, which is a concept in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper presents examples of random parity-check codes and Raptor codes, which are commonly used in communication systems and thus fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves solving nonlinear equations, which is a topic in computer science (cs.DS) and network optimization (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
