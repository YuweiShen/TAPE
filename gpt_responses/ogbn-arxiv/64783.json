Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of object detection models, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with image processing techniques, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of semi-automatic annotation techniques and the discussion of the computational cost of the proposed method suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with biometric recognition, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
