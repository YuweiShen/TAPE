Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also mentions a biologically-motivated non-linear model of certain neurons in the visual system, which suggests a possible connection to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on improving the performance of CNNs suggests a possible connection to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of convolutional layers and image classification tasks suggests a possible connection to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category, which also deals with image and text classification tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
