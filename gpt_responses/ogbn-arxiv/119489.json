This requires the development of algorithms and data structures for efficiently computing lex optima, which falls under the scope of cs.DS.\n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): Integer programming is a subfield of discrete optimization, and the paper deals with the construction of bounds on the optimum of integer programs. This falls under the scope of cs.DM.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the construction of primal and dual bounds on the optimum of integer programs, which can be useful in machine learning applications such as optimization-based classifiers and clustering algorithms.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of computing lex bounds and lex optima, which falls under the scope of cs.CC.\n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper discusses the construction of bounds on the optimum of integer programs, which can be useful in game theory applications such as mechanism design and auction theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
