This involves automated calculation and comparison of target grids within different concepts, which can be seen as an application of artificial intelligence techniques.\n- cs.SY: The paper considers technical constraints for normal operation, contingency behaviour and reliability figures in all grid concepts, which are typical concerns in control and systems engineering.\n- cs.CE: The paper economically compares the grids with regards to CAPEX and OPEX for primary and secondary equipment, which is related to cost engineering.\n- cs.ET: The paper deals with medium voltage (MV) grid concepts, which are part of the electrical engineering domain.\n- cs.DC: The paper presents a methodology to compile automated target grid plans, which involves data processing and optimization techniques that are relevant to distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
