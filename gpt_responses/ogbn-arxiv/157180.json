This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a method to counter language priors and make vision matter in VQA, which involves balancing the dataset and collecting complementary images. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
