This involves combining distributed query answering with models built for extractive question answering. The paper specifically looks at the case of knowledge bases where queries are over entities and the relations between them. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which make cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves model learning, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
