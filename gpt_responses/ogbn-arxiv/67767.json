This is a core topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the communication between multiple antennas at the transmitter and single antennas at the receivers, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes an achievable scheme to achieve the maximum degrees of freedom for the MISO broadcast channel, which involves designing a control system to optimize the transmission. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of multiple antennas to improve the transmission of multimedia content, which is a relevant topic in multimedia research. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not directly relate to this sub-category, but it is possible that the research could have implications for the societal impact of wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
