The use of matrix interpretations and semirings also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the implementation of the techniques in the tool Grez suggests a possible connection to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
