This suggests that the paper could belong to the Control Systems (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions a standalone library that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for calculus with convex sets, which could indicate that the paper could also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also discusses the choice of programming language and runtime performance, which could suggest that it could belong to the Mathematical Software (cs.MS) or Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the ability to solve complex, large-scale problems, which could indicate that it could also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
