The paper also discusses constraints on control and state trajectories, which are a common topic in optimization (cs.Optimization). The paper's focus on motion planning and control trajectories suggests that it may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO). The paper's use of spectral constraints may also make it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
