Specifically, it uses human pose detectors as a source of supervision to model the high-level structure of active objects in the scene. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are popular deep learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper deals with video prediction, which is a common problem in Robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
