Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the study of functions and their representations, which suggests cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) as possible sub-categories. The use of nested interval enclosures and dyadic rational approximation indicates cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the study of real number computation and optimization suggests cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
