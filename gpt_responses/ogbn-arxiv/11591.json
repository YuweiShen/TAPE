This involves approximating opponents' policies and training decentralized policies. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with modeling complex interacting behaviors in multi-agent systems, which is a core problem in AI. \n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper specifically focuses on modeling multi-agent interactions, which falls under the sub-category of Multi-Agent Systems. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's approach to modeling multi-agent interactions can be applied to robotics, where multiple agents may need to interact with each other to achieve a common goal. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's approach involves training decentralized policies, which can be seen as a control problem in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
