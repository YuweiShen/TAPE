This method involves using a variant of Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) called RPYS-CO, which is used to analyze co-cited publications with a highly important marker paper. This method is implemented using the CRExplorer tool. Based on this information, the paper could potentially belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SD (Software Development)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
