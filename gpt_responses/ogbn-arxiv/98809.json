The algorithm uses reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and non-uniform state representations (cs.LG) to optimize the search trajectory. The paper also mentions modeling the target probability distribution using a mixture of Gaussians, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and the ability to generate action plans for any new probability distribution using the parameters learned on other similar looking distributions, which falls under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
