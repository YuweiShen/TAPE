It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as the captions are generated using language models. The use of constrained beam search and pretrained word embeddings suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of ground-truth labels to improve caption quality, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
