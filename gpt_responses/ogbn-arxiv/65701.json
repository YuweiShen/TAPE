Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves training the neural network using radar signals, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves normalization techniques, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
