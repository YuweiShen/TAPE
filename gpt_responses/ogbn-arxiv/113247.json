The paper also proposes a novel approach that uses deep reinforcement learning (RL) for active learning (AL), which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with multi-modal data fusion, which involves processing data from multiple sources such as images and audio, which falls under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
