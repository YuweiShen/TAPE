This involves jointly learning a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function that guarantees non-expansiveness of the dynamics. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, given the focus on deep learning and the use of neural networks to model dynamical systems, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
