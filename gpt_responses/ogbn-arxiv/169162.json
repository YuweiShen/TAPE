The concept of crossing numbers is also relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The use of heuristics and integer programming suggests that the paper may also be relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
