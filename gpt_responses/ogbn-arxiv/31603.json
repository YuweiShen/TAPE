The proposed methods involve gradient aggregation and meta updating, which are commonly used in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The experiments involve various network architectures, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
