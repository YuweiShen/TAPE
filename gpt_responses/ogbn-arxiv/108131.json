The study of scheduling policies and stability is also relevant to control systems (cs.SY). The analysis of the tail of the steady-state distribution and the expected steady-state backlog is related to probability and statistics (cs.PF) and the study of excursions of the maximum backlog over a finite time horizon is related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
