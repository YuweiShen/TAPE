This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The system also involves automated identification of device types, which could fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the system, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
