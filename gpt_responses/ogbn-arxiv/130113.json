The use of nonparametric methods and distributional distance metrics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.ST). The asymptotic analysis of the problem and the consideration of countably infinite variations within a family of distributions may also make it relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
