The proposed method involves the use of a deep neural network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The task of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which is used to evaluate the proposed model, is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for signal recovery is a topic of interest in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
