The use of coalitions and merging of proposals also suggests a connection to social choice theory and voting systems, which are often studied in the subfield of social informatics (cs.SI). The algorithmic aspect of the paper, specifically the dynamic programming algorithm, falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the use of metric spaces and mathematical analysis suggests a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
