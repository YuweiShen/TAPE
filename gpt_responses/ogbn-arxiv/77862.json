The paper also discusses query cost estimation techniques, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of regular expressions and graph structures suggests that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
