The paper proposes a method for generating positive bounding boxes for training object detectors, which involves sampling and distribution, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two popular object detection datasets, indicating a potential interest in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
