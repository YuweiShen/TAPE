The paper discusses the expressive power of these protocols in terms of the properties of outputs that they eventually ensure. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Symbolic Computation (cs.SC). However, given the focus on distributed computation and networks of agents, cs.DC and cs.SI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses verification complexity, which is relevant to cs.SC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
