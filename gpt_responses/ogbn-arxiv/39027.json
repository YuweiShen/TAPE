This is a common problem in information theory, and the paper introduces a novel approach to solving it. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves learning a dictionary from signal examples, which is a common problem in machine learning. Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for dictionary learning that is capable of handling high-dimensional data. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with graph signals, which are signals defined on graphs. This is a common problem in social and information networks, where data is often represented as graphs. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for dictionary learning that is capable of handling high-dimensional data. This is a common problem in data structures and algorithms, where efficient algorithms are needed to handle large datasets. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a new algorithm for dictionary learning that involves solving a constrained optimization problem.
