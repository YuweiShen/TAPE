This is the most likely category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the interaction between multiple EVs and a common distribution transformer, and considers the impact of charging on the distribution network. This suggests a systems and control perspective.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly use machine learning techniques, the problem of distributed charging in EV networks is a relevant application area for machine learning, and some related work in this area has been published in the machine learning literature.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a problem that arises in the context of networked EVs, and considers the impact of charging on the distribution network. This suggests a networking and internet architecture perspective.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational model of the charging game, and conducts numerical simulations to analyze its properties. This suggests a computational engineering perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
