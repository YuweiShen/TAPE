The paper also proposes an information-theoretic privacy framework using entropy, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of Fisher information, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the need for systematic methods for setting privacy parameters, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS).
