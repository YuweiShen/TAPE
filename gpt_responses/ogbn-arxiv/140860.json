The use of saliency and boundary box alignment also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of deep features, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the application of pedestrian detection has relevance to robotics (cs.RO) and autonomous vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
