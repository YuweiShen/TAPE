The specific applications of the proposed framework are Bayesian optimization and Bayesian quadrature, which are also common topics in machine learning (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves optimization and numerical methods, which are relevant to the subfields of optimization (cs.DS) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
