The paper also involves analyzing the width and area of the drawings, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The connection between LR-drawings and outerplanar straight-line drawings suggests that the paper may also be relevant to graph theory (cs.GT) and possibly even social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
