This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including computer vision (cs.CV), computer graphics (cs.GR), machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL) for text-based shape representations. However, given the focus on geometric transformations, cs.CV and cs.GR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
