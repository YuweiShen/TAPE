The paper proposes a new approach that utilizes deep metric learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The approach involves training a neural network to learn a general representation of the input samples, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves natural language processing to some extent, as it discusses the use of non-linear distance metric functions, which is a common technique in computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a subfield of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
