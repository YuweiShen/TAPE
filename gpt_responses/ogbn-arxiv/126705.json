This approach may involve the use of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions that the usage of CTMC with discrete-time transitions is supported by a number of techniques for their analysis, which may fall under the category of systems and control.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves numerical methods for approximating probability distributions using phase-type distributions.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve information theory concepts in the analysis of the proposed method for approximating distributions with regions of zero density."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
