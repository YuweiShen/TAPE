The use of infinite constellations and lattices suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the decoding process, which is a key aspect of network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the title explicitly mentions multiple access channels (MAC), which falls under the category of multiple access (MA) in communication systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
