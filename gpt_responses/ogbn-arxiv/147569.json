The proposed method is based on deep learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a large-scale dataset, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the incorporation of a dominant prototype softmax, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the challenges of under-represented intra-class variations, which could be considered a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
