The paper also mentions the use of high-level representations of a person's facial image, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with video modification. \n\nThe use of a feed-forward network architecture suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on creating natural-looking image sequences suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of global network architecture that does not need to be retrained for a given video or identity suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
