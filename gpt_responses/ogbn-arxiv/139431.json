This involves the use of machine learning techniques to learn trajectories and infer new ones. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.LG, which deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) for navigation applications and robotics (cs.RO) for robotic navigations and path planning for autonomous vehicles. Finally, the paper also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) for individualized wayfinding for people with disabilities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
