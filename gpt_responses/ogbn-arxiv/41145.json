The method also takes into account both local and global interactions within the shape domain, which suggests that it may be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between the new method and PDE-based shape representation schemes, which suggests that it may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
