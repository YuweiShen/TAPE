The paper also discusses the use of compress-and-forward techniques, which is a common approach in network coding (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper considers specific channel models, such as the Gaussian channel, which is relevant to multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
