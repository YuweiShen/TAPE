This suggests that the paper may belong to the Embedded Systems (cs.ET) or Architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic model checking for reliability and safety analysis, which suggests that it may also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) or Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories.
