The use of probabilistic models and Bayesian inference also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The Hamilton-Jacobi reachability framework is a mathematical tool commonly used in control theory and system dynamics, which could place the paper in the systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the use of simulation and hardware experiments suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) for perception and sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
