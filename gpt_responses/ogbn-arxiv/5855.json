The focus on scaling with small batch sizes suggests a focus on optimization and efficiency, which is often discussed in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The use of deep learning models for computer vision applications (cs.CV) is also mentioned. The paper also discusses the use of synchronous training methods (cs.DC) and model averaging (cs.NE), which are relevant sub-categories. Finally, the use of hyper-parameter tuning (cs.AI) is mentioned, which is another relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
