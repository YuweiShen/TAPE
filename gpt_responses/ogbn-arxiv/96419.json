The paper primarily focuses on the use of data-centric algorithms and the need to complement them with anatomy and physiology knowledge. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), as they are all related to the use of machine learning and AI in various fields. Additionally, cs.DB (Databases) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) are also possible categories, as the paper discusses the need for a Medical Wikipedia for Smart Machines and the importance of integrating intelligence into AI diagnostic support solutions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
