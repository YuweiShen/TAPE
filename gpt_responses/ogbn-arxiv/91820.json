The paper proposes decision trees as an alternative to binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for strategy representation. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the verification and synthesis of reactive systems, which suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of entropy-based minimization, which suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
