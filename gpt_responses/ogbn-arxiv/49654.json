This is a core area of computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a fully automatic particle picking approach, which involves training a model to recognize particles. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The use of machine learning to automate particle picking can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.GR (Graphics) - Cryo-EM involves generating 3D reconstructions from 2D projections, which can be considered as a graphics problem.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Cryo-EM involves processing and analyzing multimedia data (micrographs), which can be considered as a sub-domain of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
