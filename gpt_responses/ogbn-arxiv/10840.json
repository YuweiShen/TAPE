The proposed method involves a novel feature fusion module, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention the use of multibox detectors, which are a type of neural network architecture (cs.NE). Finally, the paper reports results on the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets, which are commonly used benchmarks in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
