It also introduces a tool (Lambada) for automated code decomposition and conversion. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on deploying Python code as modular FaaS units on AWS Lambda, which involves distributed computing. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the challenges of implementing cloud applications in non-functional languages like Python and proposes a solution for transforming Python code into FaaS units. \n- cs.DL (Digital Libraries): Unlikely, but possible as the paper discusses an open source prototype implementation of the Lambada tool. \n- cs.SD (Sound): Unlikely, but possible as the paper discusses algorithms and code rewriting rules for transforming Python code into FaaS units, which could be considered a form of sound programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
