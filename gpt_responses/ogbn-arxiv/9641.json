This involves using expert state trajectories and action pairs to estimate rewards. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning method that involves learning an internal model of observation to estimate rewards. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for reward estimation in reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of AI. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The experiments conducted in this paper involve environments of varying complexity, including Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird games, which are visual environments. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The experiments conducted in this paper involve visual environments, which may involve graphics. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): Reinforcement learning is a subfield of robotics, and this paper proposes a new method for reward estimation in reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
