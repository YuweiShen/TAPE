Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves the study of symmetric boolean templates, which are related to logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves the use of algorithms and reasoning to solve computational problems, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the study of geometric constraints, making cs.CG (Computational Geometry) a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
