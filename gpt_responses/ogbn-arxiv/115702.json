The paper also discusses the need for detectors to obtain additional usage examples to train their models, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL). The consequences of API misuses, such as software crashes and vulnerabilities, fall under the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) category. The development of an automated benchmark for detector comparison relates to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses possible directions towards more powerful detectors, which relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
