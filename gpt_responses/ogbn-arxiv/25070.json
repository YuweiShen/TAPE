This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper involves constructing codes using rational function fields, which may involve computational complexity. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper involves constructing codes, which can be seen as a type of data structure. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not directly deal with social networks, but the concept of codes and error correction is relevant in the context of information networks. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper does not directly deal with computational geometry, but the use of Riemann-Roch spaces and evaluations of rational functions may involve geometric concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
