The approach involves using a robot to assist with scanning the tissue precisely without hand tremors and an auto-focus image-based control algorithm to optimize the quality of pCLE images. This involves aspects of robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), medical imaging (cs.MED), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
