The limited communication capabilities of the nodes and the need to deal with noise and imperfections suggest that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of coding techniques to achieve noise-resilience and the analysis of the round complexity of algorithms suggest that the paper may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The simulation of algorithms designed for the CONGEST($B$) model suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the study of the optimality of coding for certain tasks suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
