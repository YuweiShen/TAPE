The proposed algorithm is based on stochastic optimization and exploits the correlation and unimodality properties of the model, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper specifically mentions massive MIMO systems, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
