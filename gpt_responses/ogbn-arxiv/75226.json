Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization problems and modeling of network performance, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The proposed scheme is distributed, which suggests a focus on control and system theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with interference and congestion, which are topics related to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
