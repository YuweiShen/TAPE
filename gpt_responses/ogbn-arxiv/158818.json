The paper specifically focuses on time-space tradeoffs for solving this problem, which suggests that it may belong to categories such as data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper also mentions the structure of maximal repetitions in the input documents, which is a topic related to combinatorics and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper uses techniques from previous work on the LCS with Mismatches problem and space-efficient parsing, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
