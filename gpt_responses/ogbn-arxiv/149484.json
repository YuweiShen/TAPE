The authors specifically focus on regularizers such as $F_\\beta$ measure, Area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) and Precision at a fixed recall (P@R), which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications. The paper also discusses the scalability issues that arise when dealing with large datasets, which is a common problem in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the authors present experimental results on the MSCOCO Stuff segmentation dataset, which is a common benchmark dataset in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
