The paper also discusses numerical linear algebra and sketching solutions, which are topics commonly found in the sub-categories cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper's focus on tensoring of data points and polynomial kernels suggests a possible fit with the sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper's discussion of the Gaussian kernel on bounded datasets suggests a possible fit with the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
