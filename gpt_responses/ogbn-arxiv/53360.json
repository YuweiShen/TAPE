The paper also utilizes state-of-the-art undirected MST algorithms, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The algorithm's efficiency is also a key focus, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
