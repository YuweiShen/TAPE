The system also involves encoding hidden text with zero probability of error, which relates to information theory (cs.IT). The use of randomization in the proposed system suggests a potential application in multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the rate of transmission of hidden information and the size of the alphabet of the covertext source, which could be relevant to machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
