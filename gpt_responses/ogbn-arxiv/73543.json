The use of encoder-decoder style neural networks and external evidence from Wikipedia suggests that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on generating high-quality arguments also suggests that this paper could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the use of external evidence from Wikipedia also suggests that this paper could be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
