The paper's focus on learning and optimization suggests that it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the complexity of the problems and provides upper and lower bounds, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of surrogate functions and black-box transformations suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
