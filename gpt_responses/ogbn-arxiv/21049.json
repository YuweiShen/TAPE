The use of multiple instance learning (MIL) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of attention-based MIL, which could place it in the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
