The paper proposes a novel method for knowledge graph embedding that explicitly simulates crossover interactions, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely categories. The paper also evaluates the embeddings on link prediction tasks, which is a common task in natural language processing and information retrieval, suggesting cs.CL and cs.IR as likely categories. Finally, the paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are a type of database, suggesting cs.DB as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
