Therefore, cs.IR is another likely category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method that involves learning a transformation of the document embedding to minimize the similarity between the extractive summary and the ground truth summary. This involves the use of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a possible category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method that involves leveraging semantic information in sentence embeddings to create an extractive summary. This involves the use of AI techniques, making cs.AI a possible category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper is not directly related to computer vision, the use of embeddings is a common technique in computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, cs.CV is a less likely but still possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
