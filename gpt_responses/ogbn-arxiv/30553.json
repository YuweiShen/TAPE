The paper also discusses low-density codes, which are commonly used in channel coding (cs.CC). The paper also mentions source coding with side information (SCSI) and channel coding with side information (CCSI), which are subtopics of information theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the nested structure of the compound construction, which is related to graph theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the sparse structure and high girth of the proposed codes, which are properties of low-density codes and graphical codes (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
