The focus is on CSPs of bounded width, which are closely related to the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also introduces a new consistency notion, which is a concept in Logic and Computation (cs.LO), and discusses its computational advantages, which are relevant to Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
