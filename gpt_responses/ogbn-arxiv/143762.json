This falls under the scope of machine learning, specifically in the area of optimization and algorithm design. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the medoid problem and proposes an algorithmic solution that reduces the number of distance computations needed. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms, specifically in the area of computational geometry and optimization. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning algorithm for solving a computational problem, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and provides bounds on its performance in terms of data parameters. This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics, specifically in the area of combinatorics and optimization. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The medoid problem is a common problem in clustering and network analysis, which falls under the scope of social and information networks.
