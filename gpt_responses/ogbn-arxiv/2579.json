Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as active learning and optimization, which are covered in cs.LG and cs.DM. The paper also deals with the synchronization of a Mealy machine with an MDP, which falls under the category of control systems, covered in cs.SY.
