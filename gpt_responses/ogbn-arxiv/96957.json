This topic falls under the umbrella of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions specific signal models such as total variation semi-norm, which is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the use of conic integral geometry suggests a focus on optimization and numerical analysis (cs.NA), while the consideration of probabilities for structured signal partitions suggests a potential connection to statistics and probability (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
