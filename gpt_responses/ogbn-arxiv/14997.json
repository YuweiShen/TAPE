The use of t-exponential family distributions is also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV), as these fields often deal with real-world data that may have outliers and fat-tailed distributions. The evaluation of the approach on challenging benchmarks suggests that it may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
