This falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also formulates the problem as a Markov decision process and proposes a new algorithm based on the Model Reference Adaptive Search method, which involves optimization and learning, falling under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents numerical results to show the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning, falling under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
