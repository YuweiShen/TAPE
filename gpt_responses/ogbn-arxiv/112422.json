Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a neural network-based approach, which falls under the scope of cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) and cs.SD (sound). Finally, the paper mentions social robotics, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
