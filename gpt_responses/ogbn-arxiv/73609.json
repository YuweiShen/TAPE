Additionally, the paper proposes a transfer-learnable NLI for databases, which involves machine learning and transfer learning techniques, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper also focuses on the separation of data and schema in databases, which is a key aspect of database management, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category.
