Additionally, the paper discusses adversarial attacks and defenses, which are often studied in the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE), and proposes methods for evaluating the security of classifiers, which could also fall under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
