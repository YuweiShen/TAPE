The proposed methods aim to assist users in selecting entity graphs for their needs, which is a common task in database management. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The preview tables are designed to help users quickly preview and explore large datasets before deciding to investigate them further. This is a common task in information retrieval, where users need to quickly assess the relevance of search results. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The optimization problems formulated in the paper involve finding previews with the highest scores according to intuitive goodness measures. This is a common task in artificial intelligence, where optimization problems are often used to find optimal solutions to complex problems. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Entity graphs are commonly used to represent social and information networks, and the proposed methods aim to help users select the most relevant entity graphs for their needs. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes dynamic-programming and Apriori-style algorithms for finding optimal previews under various constraints. This is a common task in data structures and algorithms, where efficient algorithms are often needed to process large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
