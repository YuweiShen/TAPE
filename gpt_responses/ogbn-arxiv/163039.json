The use of algebraic structures and category theory is also relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.CT (Category Theory): The paper introduces Eilenberg-Moore monoids, which are a concept from category theory. The paper also discusses monoidal categories, which are a topic in category theory.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with the implementation of backtracking, which is a common technique in automata theory.
