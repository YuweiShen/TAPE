The use of feedback controllers and evaluation of control authority also falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also introduces a novel metric for evaluating robustness, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper includes visualization tools for comparing metrics, which could be relevant to researchers in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
