It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with improving learning performance. Additionally, the paper mentions signal processing and image processing, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of mixture kernels and the investigation of free parameters suggest that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with robustness, which is relevant to the statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
