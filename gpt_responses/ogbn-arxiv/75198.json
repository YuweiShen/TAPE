The use of an embedding of $\\ell_2$ into the space of matrices suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The problem being studied involves matrices and their properties, which suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of approximation algorithms, which suggests that cs.SD (Sound and Symbolic Data) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
