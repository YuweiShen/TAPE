The use of semidefinite programming and the study of approximation factors suggest that the paper may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The geometric nature of the problem and the use of embeddings suggest that it may also belong to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the study of stability and robustness suggests that it may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
