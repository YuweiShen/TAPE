The paper also discusses the use of resampling techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) to address imbalanced data. The paper also mentions the use of heuristic undersampling, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to address imbalanced data. Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using classification metrics, which is a topic that falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
