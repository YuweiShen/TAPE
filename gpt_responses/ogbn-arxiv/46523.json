Additionally, the paper discusses the use of DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) which is a wireless communication protocol used for V2V and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. \n\nThe paper also involves data processing and modeling, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of statistical methods to analyze the data could also place it in the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the limitations of the data collection and modeling, including the presence of interference and a high noise floor, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as these limitations could impact the security and reliability of V2V communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
