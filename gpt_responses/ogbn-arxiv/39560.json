The paper focuses on the expressiveness of the terminological language, the ability to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and the decidability of TKRS-deduction services. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), logic in computer science (cs.LO), databases (cs.DB), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and software engineering (cs.SE).
