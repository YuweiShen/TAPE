The paper also discusses the evaluation of detection stability and robustness, which can be considered as a machine learning problem (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the problems of severe occlusion and clutter background, which are related to computer security (cs.CR). The paper evaluates the performance of existing pedestrian detection algorithms, which can be considered as a machine learning task (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the influence of different distortion types on the performance of pedestrian detection algorithms, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
