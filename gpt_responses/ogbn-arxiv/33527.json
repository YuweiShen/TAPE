Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on image recognition tasks, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper involves training the neural networks via back-propagation, which is a common technique in machine learning, indicating that it could also be classified as cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of trainable parameters in the functional transfer matrices also suggests that it may belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
