Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also addresses the issue of 3D fatigue, which is related to graphics (GR) and multimedia (MM). The proposed method involves training a neural network, which falls under artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
