Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of computational methods to survey households, which could fall under the sub-categories of Cybernetics (cs.CY) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE).
