The paper proposes a probabilistic activation function called ProbAct, which can be used to prevent overfitting and improve image classification performance. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
