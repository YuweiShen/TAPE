Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions Automatic Text Recognition and Keyword Spotting, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed evaluation scheme is based on baselines, which are often used in deep learning (cs.DL) and machine learning (cs.LG) for text recognition tasks. Finally, the paper deals with challenges in text line segmentation, which is a problem in computer graphics (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
