This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also employs stochastic channel models and analyzes the spatial and frequency domains, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of antenna arrays on the channel model, which is relevant to communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
