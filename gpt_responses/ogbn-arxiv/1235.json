Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of AdamT with state-of-the-art models on several classical real-world datasets, indicating that it could also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the method on large-scale sparse datasets, which suggests it could be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper presents a new framework for adapting Adam-type methods, which could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
