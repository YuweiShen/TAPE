The paper presents a new algorithm for finding a coloring that minimizes the $\\ell_2$-discrepancy of a family of sets, and provides new inequalities relating the hereditary $\\ell_\\infty$-discrepancy and the hereditary $\\ell_2$-discrepancy to the eigenvalues of the matrix corresponding to the sets. These topics are closely related to the fields of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
