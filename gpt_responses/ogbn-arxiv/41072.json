Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for learning to predict sets using deep neural networks, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques for set prediction, which suggests that it may also belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category.
