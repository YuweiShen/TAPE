The problem of testing whether a distribution is k-wise uniform or delta-far from k-wise uniform is a common topic in computer science theory (cs.CC), and the sample complexity results suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on probability distributions and their properties suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
