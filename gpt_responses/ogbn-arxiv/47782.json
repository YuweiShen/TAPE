This suggests that the paper could belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of explainability in embodied agents, which could fall under the Robotics (cs.RO) category. The use of different modalities and the need to measure the impact of explainability suggest that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computer Vision (cs.CV) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
