The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmarks commonly used in computer vision, further supporting this category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel method for zero-shot classification, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The proposed method involves learning both human-defined and automatically discovered attributes, which is a common approach in AI.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for zero-shot classification. The proposed method involves jointly learning attributes and conducting predictions within a subspace, which is a common approach in machine learning.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves natural language processing in the form of human-defined attributes. The proposed method involves using both human-defined and automatically discovered attributes, which is a common approach in computational linguistics.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves measuring prediction confidence, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed method involves measuring confidence using both defined and residual attributes, which is a common approach in IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
