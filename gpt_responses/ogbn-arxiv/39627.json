This involves hardware constraints such as crossbar blocks pruning, conductance range, and mismatch between weight value and real devices. The paper also uses the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for optimization. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
