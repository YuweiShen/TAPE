Additionally, the paper mentions evaluating the performance trade-offs of each approach with respect to resource-efficiency, latency predictability, and isolation, which are all relevant topics in distributed computing. \n\nThe paper also mentions convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spatial and temporal multiplexing, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the potential for improved utilization through the exploration of more advanced spatial and temporal multiplexing strategies, which is a topic relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions a prototype of a dynamic space-time scheduler, which could potentially fall under the category of augmented reality (cs.AR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
