The proposed method extends the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to the relative setting by using estimates of the pairwise probabilities to select a promising arm and applying Upper Confidence Bound with the winner as a benchmark. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The empirical results of the proposed method are evaluated using real data from an information retrieval application. This indicates that the paper may belong to the information retrieval sub-category. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves using estimates of pairwise probabilities to select a promising arm, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for the K-armed dueling bandit problem, which falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The proposed method may have applications in social and information networks, as it involves selecting the best arm based on relative feedback about pairs of arms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
