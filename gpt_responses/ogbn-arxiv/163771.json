This makes it likely to belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the diameter and connected components of WRGs, which are typical topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also mentions domination number, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GR) and the use of positive and negative witnesses to draw combinatorial graphs as WRGs, which is related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
