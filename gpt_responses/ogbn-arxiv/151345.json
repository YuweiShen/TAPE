The paper proposes a novel perspective based on spectral graph theory to generate coarsened networks that maximally preserve the spectral properties of the original network. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis and modeling of social and information networks, which is the primary application domain of network summarization techniques. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures, which is relevant to the proposed algorithm for generating coarsened networks. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development and analysis of machine learning algorithms, which is relevant to the application of network summarization techniques in machine learning. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and testing of software systems, which is relevant to the implementation and evaluation of the proposed algorithm. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category deals with the design, analysis, and optimization of computer networks and internet protocols, which is relevant to the analysis of large-scale networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
