This involves the use of visualizations to support sensemaking activities of users involved in various phases of the training life cycle. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. \n\nThe paper also focuses on cybersecurity, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.CY (Computers and Society). Additionally, the use of visual analytics principles involves the analysis of large and complex data sets, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
