This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of robot games and presents a lower bound, which is a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory.\n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): Robot games are a type of game theory problem, and the paper presents an algorithm for solving them. This falls under the scope of computer science and game theory.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an algorithm for solving a game, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence research.\n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computational geometry, the problem of adding integers to a counter on the integer line can be seen as a geometric problem.
