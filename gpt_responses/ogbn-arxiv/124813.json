The paper proposes a new method for lossy compression of DNNs by weight quantization and lossless source coding, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses entropy coding schemes and proposes universal lossless source coding schemes, which are relevant to researchers in information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
