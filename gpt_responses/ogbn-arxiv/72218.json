The proposed activation function, MTLU, is aimed at increasing the nonlinear modeling capacity while reducing the network size, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions improvements in memory and runtime, which could be related to neural network optimization (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
