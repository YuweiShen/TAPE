The paper draws an analogy between the problem of support recovery and the problem of channel coding over the Gaussian multiple access channel, and exploits mathematical tools developed for the latter problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. The paper also develops sharp sufficient and necessary conditions on the number of measurements in terms of the signal sparsity level and the measurement noise level, which involves analyzing the performance limits of support recovery. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories, which are related to the analysis of performance limits and optimization problems in various domains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
