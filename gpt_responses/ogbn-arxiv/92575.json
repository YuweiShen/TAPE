Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel LSTM-based temporal ranking function, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also deals with video processing, which falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of deep learning models, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
