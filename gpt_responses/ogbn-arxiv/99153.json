The method is designed specifically for post-mortem samples, making it relevant to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions fine-tuning the segmentation model and using Siamese networks, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper focuses on iris recognition, which falls under the category of biometrics and image recognition (cs.IR). Finally, the paper mentions a newly collected database of post-mortem iris images, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
