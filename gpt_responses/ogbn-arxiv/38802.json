This problem is related to network infrastructure (NI) and data communication (DC) as it involves the optimization of network resources. It also involves the optimization of service instances (SI) and information theory (IT) as it aims to minimize network resource consumption. Additionally, the paper proposes a two-phase column-generation-based model and solution, which is related to robotics (RO) as it involves optimization and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
