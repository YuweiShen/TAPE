This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves the detection and classification of circular structures in images. The paper also utilizes machine learning techniques such as active learning and conditional random fields, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with the extraction of phenotypic data from images.
