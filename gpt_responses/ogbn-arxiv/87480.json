The use of dynamical system representations also suggests a connection to the categories of neural and evolutionary computation (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents results from solving test problems, indicating a potential connection to the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
