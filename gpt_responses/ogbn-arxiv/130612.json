The system also involves a user-friendly interface, which suggests the involvement of human-computer interaction (cs.SI). The use of belief functions and Bayesian decision analysis also suggests the involvement of data science (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
