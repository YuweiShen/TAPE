The paper also mentions the use of incomplete and imprecise preferences, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or computational engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the application examples given in the abstract (business strategies, facility locations, building designs) suggest a potential connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
