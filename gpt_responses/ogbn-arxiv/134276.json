This topic falls under the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper mentions multimedia (cs.MM) and system and control (cs.SY) aspects of the algorithms. Information Theory (cs.IT) is also relevant as the algorithms aim to optimize link capacity utilization. Finally, Performance (cs.PF) is another possible sub-category as the paper evaluates the performance of the algorithms on a simulation environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
