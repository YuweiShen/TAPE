The use of integral invariants and the moving frame method suggests that the paper may also belong to computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the analysis of the robustness of the proposed method suggests that the paper may also belong to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
