The paper proposes an adaptive seeding strategy for this problem, which involves modeling the dynamic independent cascade model and developing a greedy algorithm for selecting seed users. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
