The paper discusses new estimators and provides sample complexity analyses, asymptotic optimality, and insights into the learned importance weights. This work is highly relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
