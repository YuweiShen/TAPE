The paper also discusses the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for acoustic modeling, which is a subfield of machine learning (ML) and falls under the computer science category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) or \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also addresses issues related to overfitting and generalization, which are common concerns in ML and can be categorized under \"Statistics\" (cs.ST) or \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to CD symbol modeling, which involves the use of embedding networks, a technique commonly used in ML for natural language processing, and can be categorized under \"Information Retrieval\" (cs.IR) or \"Signal Processing\" (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
