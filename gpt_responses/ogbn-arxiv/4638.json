The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the converted networks to Atari games involves image classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the improved robustness of the converted networks, which is related to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the conversion of the networks to spiking neural networks involves the use of hardware platforms, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
