Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as autoregressive models and Transformers, which are commonly used in sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions document ranking, which is a task related to information retrieval, a sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on tasks such as natural language inference and sentiment analysis, which are also related to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
