The use of triplet loss function and classification loss function also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of natural language processing techniques to extract semantic features could also suggest a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
