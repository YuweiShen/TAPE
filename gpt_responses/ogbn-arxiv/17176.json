The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests that it could belong to the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study also models variations in human impairments, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of neural networks for training policies suggests that it could also belong to the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study involves the use of multi-modal sensing, which could fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
