The paper presents hardness of approximation results for the problem, which is a typical topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and hypercontractivity theory (cs.DS) to prove the results. The problem of matrix norms is closely related to the problem of matrix factorization, which is a central topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves numerical analysis techniques such as Gaussian norms, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
