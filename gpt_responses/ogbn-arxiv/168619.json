It involves predicting time-average rate and channel gains of NRT mobile users, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also considers two types of NRT services, video on demand and video on reservation, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) aspects. Finally, the paper formulates an optimization problem to allocate resources with ensured quality of service, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
