These topics are typically studied in the sub-categories of programming languages (cs.PL), logic in computer science (cs.LO), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and software engineering (cs.SE). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
