The paper proposes a new approach called ConnNet for salient segmentation, which is a task that involves grouping pixels into salient regions. This task is closely related to image segmentation, which falls under the computer vision category. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also proposes a new way of formulating the salient segmentation task as a pixel-pair-based connectivity prediction task. This approach involves predicting the connectivity probabilities of each pixel with its neighboring pixels. This formulation is related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are subfields of computer science. Therefore, the second most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe proposed approach also leverages multi-level cascade contexts embedded in the image and long-range pixel relations. This involves using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are subfields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the third most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also compares the proposed approach with existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This involves evaluating the performance of the proposed approach using various metrics such as precision,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
