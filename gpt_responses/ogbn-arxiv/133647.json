The paper proposes a new approach that combines high-level reasoning (using probabilistic logic) and low-level learning (mapping visual features to grasping points) for task-dependent grasping. This involves using object/task ontologies and affordances, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach also involves learning from visual features, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the approach involves controlling a robot, which is a subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
