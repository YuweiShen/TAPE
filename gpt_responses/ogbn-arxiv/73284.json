The paper also mentions the use of different processing and storage engines, which suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of unstructured text and imagery in the medical dataset also suggests a potential focus on information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses performance results and future development plans, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) if the system is being optimized using machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
