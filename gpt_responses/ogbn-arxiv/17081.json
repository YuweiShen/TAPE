The primary focus is on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (LG) techniques, which are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NE) in the proposed approach. Additionally, the experiments involve multiple datasets, indicating that multimedia (MM) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
