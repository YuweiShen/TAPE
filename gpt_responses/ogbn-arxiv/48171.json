The model is trained using a dual encoder network, which is a popular architecture in natural language processing (NLP) and falls under the category of deep learning. The paper also discusses the use of embeddings, which is a common technique in NLP for representing words and phrases as vectors. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and speech processing. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of a Siamese-like neural network architecture, which is a type of deep learning model that is commonly used for similarity-based tasks such as image or text matching. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which covers a broad range of topics related to AI and machine learning. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of tf-idf, which is a classic information retrieval technique used for ranking documents based on their relevance to a query. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category, which covers topics related to search engines, recommendation systems, and other information retrieval applications. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the practical application of the proposed model in a closed domain like customer service.
