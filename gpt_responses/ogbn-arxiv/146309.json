The use of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes and random linear network coding (RLNC) also suggests a strong connection to information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a private information retrieval (PIR) scheme to ensure that a user can request a file without revealing any information on which file is being requested to any of the servers. This is a key problem in cryptography and security. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the problem of storing and retrieving data from a distributed storage system (DSS), which is a core problem in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper proposes a novel PIR scheme that allows the user to recover a file from a storage system with low communication cost, while allowing some servers in the system to collude in the quest of revealing the identity of the requested file. This suggests a connection to computational complexity. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of providing privacy to users requesting data over a network, which is a core problem in networking and internet architecture.
