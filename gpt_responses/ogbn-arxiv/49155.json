This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new training strategy (DDC-AT) that involves unsupervised learning, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with defending against adversarial attacks, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new training strategy that involves dividing pixels into multiple branches, which could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
