It uses a computational theory of human memory to integrate the two-level conception and the process of forgetting in the form of a tag recommender and tests it in three large-scale social tagging datasets. The paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it deals with the development of a recommender system. It also involves natural language processing and semantic analysis, which are relevant to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The paper also uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the performance of the tag recommender, which is relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also deals with social tagging systems, which are relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the development of a computational model of human memory, which is relevant to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
