However, given that the paper focuses on the impact of asynchronism on coded caching, it is most likely to be classified under the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Other relevant sub-categories include Networked Systems (cs.NI), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG), as these areas are also relevant to the problem of coded caching."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
