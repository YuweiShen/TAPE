This involves both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques, which are covered by the cs.CL and cs.CV sub-categories respectively. The paper also evaluates the ability of the model to make use of images to improve translation, which involves machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, covered by the cs.AI sub-category. The paper presents experimental results and compares different attention mechanisms, which involves statistical learning (SL) and machine learning (ML) techniques, covered by the cs.LG sub-category.
