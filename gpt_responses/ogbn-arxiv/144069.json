Hence, it is highly likely to belong to the Computer Vision category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of Neural Network Architectures for detecting parking spaces and vehicles in satellite images also falls under the domain of Artificial Intelligence. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of Machine Learning techniques for training the Neural Network Architectures also makes this paper a likely candidate for the Machine Learning category. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The use of raster images from USGS image archive for developing images for training and testing also falls under the domain of Graphics. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The detection of parking spaces and vehicles in satellite images can also be useful in the domain of Robotics for autonomous navigation and parking of vehicles. Hence, this paper can also be categorized under Robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
