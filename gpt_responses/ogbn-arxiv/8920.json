Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel method that uses multiple loss functions and a specific training strategy, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on various datasets, including Cityscapes and FoggyCityscapes, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
