The use of \"black-box\" models and the need for explanations suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The user study and evaluation of the proposed algorithm suggest a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of Monte Carlo simulations and the evaluation of the algorithm's performance suggest a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
