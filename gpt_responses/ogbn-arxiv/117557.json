The use of variational autoencoders to generate latent embeddings from user reviews suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the potential application of the proposed method to image-based recommendations (as mentioned in the abstract) suggests that the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
