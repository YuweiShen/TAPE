This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.DM: The paper discusses the use of Chi-Square tests to detect the independence between two probability distributions in order to learn the structure of a factored MDP. This falls under the scope of data mining.\n- cs.SY: The paper discusses a framework for addressing large stochastic reinforcement learning problems, which involves control systems and decision-making processes. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.RO: The paper discusses the use of decision-theoretic planning algorithms based on FMDPs to compute policies, which falls under the scope of robotics and automation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
