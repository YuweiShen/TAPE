This involves techniques from circuit complexity, learning theory, and distribution testing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also draws connections to information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
