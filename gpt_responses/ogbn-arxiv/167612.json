The use of LLX, SCX, and VLX primitives also suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the experimental performance analysis indicates a focus on efficiency and optimization, which could fall under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
