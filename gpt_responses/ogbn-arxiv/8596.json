The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The fact that it can handle occlusion and is agnostic to visual ambiguities suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of a visual loss function suggests that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
