This involves modeling workers' annotations and reducing the impact of unreliable workers. The paper also introduces an active crowdsourcing learning strategy for selecting sample-label-worker triplets to collect reliable annotations with reduced cost. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach for modeling workers' annotations and reducing the impact of unreliable workers, which involves machine learning techniques. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper introduces an active crowdsourcing learning strategy for selecting sample-label-worker triplets to collect reliable annotations with reduced cost, which involves machine learning techniques. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with crowdsourcing, which involves the interaction between humans and computers. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with collecting annotations for data, which is relevant to information retrieval. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with multi-label data, which is relevant to natural language processing and computational linguistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
