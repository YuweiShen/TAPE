This involves the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) to learn the displacement field function. The paper also discusses the theoretical guarantee of the method, which involves the use of geometric reasoning (cs.GR) and optimization techniques (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
