The paper also introduces a new algorithm that uses embedding constraints, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (NLP). The paper also discusses the syntax and semantics of negative sequential patterns, which is related to language modeling and can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm proposed in the paper uses a depth-first search scheme, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses experiments on real datasets, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
