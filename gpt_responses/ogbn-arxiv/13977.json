Additionally, the paper deals with caching in networks, which could fall under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) category. The paper also proposes a novel coded caching scheme, which could be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The paper discusses the gain offered by caching, which could be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) category. Finally, the paper proposes a scheme that leads to a multiplicative improvement in the peak rate, which could be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
