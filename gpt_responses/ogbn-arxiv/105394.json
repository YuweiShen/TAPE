Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA), which is a method commonly used in machine learning and deep learning research, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper discusses the incorporation of linguistic information into NLP models, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions recurrent layers and embedding layers, which are commonly used in neural networks, suggesting that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) if the language models are used for tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
