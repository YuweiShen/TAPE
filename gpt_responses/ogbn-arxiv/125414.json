The use of deep learning models to analyze the semantic signals in reviews falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of attention mechanisms, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography (cs.CR).
