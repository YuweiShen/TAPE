This is a common problem in machine learning, and the proposed solution is likely to be of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science. The paper uses two-sample test statistics to estimate the similarity between nodes from different branches, which leads to the generation of a deep directed acyclic graph of decision rules. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
