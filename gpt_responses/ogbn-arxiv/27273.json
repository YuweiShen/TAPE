This topic falls under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the communication overhead and resilience of the proposed codes, which are related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networked Systems (cs.NI). The paper's focus on improving the maintenance process and facilitating repairs in parallel suggests that it may also fall under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
