The approach involves representing video frames by Gramian matrices that describe a trajectory on the Riemannian manifold of positive-semidefinite matrices of fixed rank. This work is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with video analysis and recognition. The use of different algorithms for curve fitting and temporal alignment steps suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques are employed. The evaluation of the approach on publicly available datasets indicates that multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
