This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also mentions the usage of app-embedding for query expansion, which falls under the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category. The paper also uses machine learning techniques for app clustering and classification, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of image analysis for app retrieval, which could fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of multimedia analysis for app retrieval, which could fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
