The use of sum-of-squares (SOS) proofs and the Lasserre SDP relaxation suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category. The study of graphs and hypergraphs also suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories.
