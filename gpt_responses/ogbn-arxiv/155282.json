The system uses a stereo camera and features a novel sensor fusion approach, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of a multi-core processor and hardware synchronization, which are related to computer architecture and systems (cs.AR) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed system using multiple datasets, which involves experimental design and analysis (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
