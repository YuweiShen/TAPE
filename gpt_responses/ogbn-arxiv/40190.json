The use of computer software to prove these inequalities suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The mention of capacity regions and rate-distortion functions suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the application of the technique to cases where the inequality holds due to statistical models suggests a connection to statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
