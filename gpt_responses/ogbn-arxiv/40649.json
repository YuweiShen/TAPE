The paper also proposes an energy-based approach for generating proposals, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of graph approximation in the proposed algorithm may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses experiments and performance evaluation, which may be relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
