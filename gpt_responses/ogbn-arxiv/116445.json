Additionally, the dataset aims to foster research in interactive graphical symbolic understanding, which could fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the dataset may also be useful for machine learning (cs.LG) research in understanding and generating diagrams."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
