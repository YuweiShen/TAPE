This is a common problem in natural language processing, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a new sentence representation that improves the performance of downstream semantic parsers, which involves machine learning techniques such as classification (cs.AI), and potentially deep learning (cs.LG). The comparison of various baselines also involves statistical analysis and evaluation metrics, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
