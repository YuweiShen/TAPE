Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The proposed model also involves attention mechanisms and learning from weakly-supervised data, which are common topics in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the task of grounding textual queries in videos can be seen as a form of information retrieval, which falls under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
