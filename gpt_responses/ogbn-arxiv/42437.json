The idea of increasing the number of dimensions of the logic space also relates to the study of high-dimensional data analysis (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of time shifts to change commutative operations into non-commuting ones, which is a concept that can be applied in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
