The use of electromagnetic emissions for contactless monitoring suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of electromagnetics (cs.EM). The paper also deals with real-time constraints and monitoring of critical infrastructures, which suggests that it may belong to the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper specifically mentions programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which suggests that it may also belong to the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
