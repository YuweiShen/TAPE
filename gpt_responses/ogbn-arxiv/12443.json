Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with the processing, analysis, and retrieval of multimedia data. The paper also involves computer vision techniques to analyze the 360VR contents, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision) another likely category. The paper also deals with the visualization of 360VR contents using Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), which falls under the category of cs.GR (Graphics). The subjective experiments involve human perception and user experience, which makes cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) another possible category. Finally, the paper involves the analysis of data obtained from experiments, which falls under the category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
