The concept of matched formulas and their generalization of biclique satisfiable formulas are studied, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the phase transition of the property \"being matched\" with respect to the ratio of clauses and variables, which is a topic in the area of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The heuristic algorithm for recognizing whether a formula is biclique satisfiable is a topic in the area of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
