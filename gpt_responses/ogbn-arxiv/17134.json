Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses statistical and neural machine translation models, which are common in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) research, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of unlimited pseudo parallel data, which involves generating synthetic data, a topic that is relevant to the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
