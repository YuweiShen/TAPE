However, the focus of the paper is on the self-assembly of infinite fractal structures using cyclic oritatami systems, which is more closely related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), graph theory (cs.GT), and theoretical computer science (cs.CC, cs.SI). The negative result and sufficient conditions established in the paper also suggest a theoretical and mathematical approach to the problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DM, cs.CC, cs.CG, cs.GT, and cs.SI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
