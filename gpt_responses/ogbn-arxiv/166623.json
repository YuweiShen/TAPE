This involves natural language processing and computational linguistics techniques.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The editor has been designed with a special attention to deaf user needs and general usability issues. This involves user-centered design and human-computer interaction.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The editor aims to help break down the \"electronic barriers\" that keep deaf people away from the web, which involves information retrieval and access.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the use of SW as an alternative to written \"verbal\" language may involve machine learning techniques for natural language processing and classification.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This category is less likely, but the paper does mention the goal of supporting linguistic research about Sign Languages features, which may involve sound analysis and processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
