The paper also discusses capacity guarantees and bounds, which are common in signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). The use of determinants and matrices suggests a connection to linear algebra (cs.MM), and the practical applications of antenna selection make it relevant to communications engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
