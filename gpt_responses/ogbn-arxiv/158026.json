The paper focuses on mitigating forgetting when learning multiple tasks in sequence, which is a common problem in lifelong learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses image and text data in some of the experiments, which suggests that it could also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
