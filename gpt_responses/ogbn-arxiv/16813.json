It also involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as it proposes non-clairvoyant policies for scheduling. Machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) could also be relevant as the paper discusses strategies and behaviors of players in the game. Finally, information theory (cs.IT) could be relevant as the paper considers the problem of private information (processing times) and truthfulness."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
