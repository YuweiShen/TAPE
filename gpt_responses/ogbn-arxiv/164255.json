The paper proposes sampling distributions that have closed forms and allow sketching of matrices presented in arbitrary order as a stream, which suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions compressibility of the resulting sketch matrices, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides provable guarantees for the proposed distributions, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
