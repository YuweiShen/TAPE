This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves maximizing the spectral efficiency of the system. The paper also deals with the design of the beamformer and combiner, which are components of the communication system, making it relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper proposes a low complexity solution for the problem, which is related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also deals with the characteristics of the massive MIMO channels, making it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the performance analysis of the proposed scheme, which is related to computer communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
