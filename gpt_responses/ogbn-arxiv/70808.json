However, the paper focuses on approaches that rely on local channel state information and require minimal or no information exchange between the base stations. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of over-the-air pilot signaling and the challenge of dynamic TDD, which are relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Communications (cs.COM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
