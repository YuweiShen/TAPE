The paper also involves joint optimization of computation and communication resources, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes algorithms to solve non-convex optimization problems, which is a common topic in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
