The paper proposes a new algorithm for automatically extracting minimum spans to disentangle coreference evaluation from boundary detection. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP and its intersection with computer science. \n\nThe paper also uses machine learning techniques to evaluate coreference resolution, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on algorithm development and evaluation makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible sub-category. \n\nThe paper's use of cross-dataset coreference evaluation and domain shift suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of NLP techniques for coreference resolution may also make cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category, as NLP techniques are increasingly being used in computer vision tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
