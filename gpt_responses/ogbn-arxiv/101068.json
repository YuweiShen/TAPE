The codes studied are permutation codes, which are a type of combinatorial object (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the generalized Cayley metric, which is a distance metric on permutations (cs.DS). The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as cloud storage systems and genome resequencing, are related to computer networks and bioinformatics, respectively, which fall under the categories of computer communication (cs.CC) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
