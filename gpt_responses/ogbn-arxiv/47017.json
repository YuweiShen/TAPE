Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category, which includes works on wireless networks and IoT. The paper also includes a theoretical analysis of LoRa's performance, which involves information theory and signal processing concepts, suggesting that it could also fit in the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Moreover, the paper discusses the impact of imperfect SF orthogonality on LoRa's throughput, which relates to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) categories, as it affects the reliability and privacy of data transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
