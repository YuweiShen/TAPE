The proposed method involves promoting sparsity in the wavelet and graph gradient domains, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses computational efficiency, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
