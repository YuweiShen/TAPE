The technique is implemented in a tool called \"mugie\" that operates on programs written in the Boogie language, which is a programming language used as intermediate representation in numerous program verifiers, suggesting a connection to programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the sources of brittle behavior in program verifiers, which involves logical reasoning and deduction, indicating a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of testing methods such as mutation testing and metamorphic testing suggests a connection to software testing (cs.ET) and formal methods (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
