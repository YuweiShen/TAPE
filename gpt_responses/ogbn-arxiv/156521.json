The paper proposes a method for cross-domain semantic parsing, which involves adapting a semantic parser trained on one domain to another domain. This is a common problem in NLP, and is likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields. \n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category, as it covers topics related to NLP, including semantic parsing and paraphrasing. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also likely, as it covers topics related to machine learning and natural language understanding. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possibility, as it covers topics related to neural networks and deep learning, which are used in the proposed method. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also possible, as it covers topics related to neural networks, which are used in the proposed method. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is less likely, but still possible, as it covers topics related to natural language search and understanding, which are relevant to semantic parsing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
