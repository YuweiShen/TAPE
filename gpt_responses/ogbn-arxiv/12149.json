This falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR) and electronic devices and systems (cs.ET). The paper also discusses various techniques for achieving resilience, including circuit-level hardening, logic-level parity checking, and micro-architectural recovery, which are related to digital circuits (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper presents a framework for exploring cross-layer resilience, which involves multiple layers of the system stack, including circuit, logic, architecture, software, and algorithm, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
