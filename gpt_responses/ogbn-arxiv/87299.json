The paper also introduces labelling-generating ontologies, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graph algorithms (cs.DS). The computational complexity of the proposed approach is also discussed, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.TH). The paper also emphasizes the modularity of the approach, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper proposes a formalism that can be used to express complex properties, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
