This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of matrix transformations, multivariate statistics, and computer algebra tools suggests a focus on mathematical methods and algorithms, which could place the paper in the mathematical software (cs.MS) or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The use of differential equations and the holonomic gradient method further supports the possibility of the systems and control sub-category. The paper also deals with numerical convergence issues, which could place it in the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential extension of the proposed approaches to other fading models and transceiver methods, which could place it in the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
