The use of compression codes to solve the phase retrieval problem involves modeling the signal in a more complex way, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes an iterative algorithm for solving the problem, which is related to mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
