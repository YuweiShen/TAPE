The algorithm also involves the use of atlases and transition functions, which are concepts from differential geometry (cs.GR) and algebraic topology (cs.DG). The paper also discusses the properties of the resulting triangulation, such as its piecewise flat metric and its relationship to the original Riemannian metric, which are topics in geometric topology (cs.GT) and computational topology (cs.SG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
