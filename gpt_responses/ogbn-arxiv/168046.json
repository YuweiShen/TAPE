It also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as the experiments are conducted on image datasets. The paper also mentions using deep neural networks (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as potential applications for their method. Finally, the paper involves linear algebra and optimization (cs.DS) as it uses the nullspace of a linear model to encourage the same label for subsets of training examples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
