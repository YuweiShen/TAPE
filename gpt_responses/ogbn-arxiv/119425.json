Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves shape-based matching and texture-based matching, which are common techniques in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The proposed algorithm also involves efficient tracking, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
