The proposed solution involves using generative models and weak supervision sources with programmatically encoded structure. The paper focuses on inferring generative model structure by statically analyzing the code for these heuristics, which falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of heuristics to label radiology data without ground truth labels suggests a connection to natural language processing and computer vision (cs.CL, cs.CV). Finally, the paper also discusses the sample complexity of identifying nth degree relations, which could be relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
