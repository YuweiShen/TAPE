The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques such as object detection and semantic segmentation, which suggests that it could also be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the use of deep learning models for these tasks indicates that it could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of working in cluttered environments, which could potentially fall under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) if the focus is on securing the robotic system in such environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
