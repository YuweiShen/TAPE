The use of computational fields to adapt to the topology of the underlying network and events occurring in it also suggests a distributed computing approach. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the issue of self-stabilisation for computational fields, which is a key concern in systems and control. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Computational fields are spatially distributed data structures, and the paper presents a calculus of computational fields. \n4. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The use of computational fields has notable applications to pervasive computing, sensor networks, and mobile robots, which are all areas of interest in multiagent systems. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The use of computational fields in mobile robots is mentioned in the paper, and the issue of self-stabilisation is relevant to the behaviour of robots in dynamic environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
