The use of LSTM and multiple-instance learning also suggests a focus on machine learning techniques, which are commonly found in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's focus on referring expressions and object properties suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the use of max-margin based objective functions suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
