The paper also presents a benchmark and evaluation of different methods, which is a common practice in the computer vision community. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as some of the methods evaluated in the benchmark may involve machine learning techniques. \n\nThe robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also a possibility as non-rigid structure from motion is relevant to robotics applications such as object tracking and manipulation. \n\nThe multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper deals with obtaining 3D information from multiple images, which is a common task in multimedia applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality. \n\nFinally, the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper deals with 3D reconstruction, which is a common task in computer graphics applications such as animation and video game development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
