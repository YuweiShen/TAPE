The paper also proposes a policy improvement scheme for MPC, which involves learning from past executions, and reshaping the cost function to improve performance. This involves machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning, which are relevant to categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with real-time constraints and contact-rich manipulation tasks, which are relevant to categories such as control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
