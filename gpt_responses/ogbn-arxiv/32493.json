The approach uses machine learning to reconstruct and mimic the solution to a centralized optimal power flow (OPF) problem from solely locally available information. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with control policies for DERs in distribution systems, which is a topic related to systems and control. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning to learn the control policies for DERs. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's use of machine learning falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention neural or evolutionary computing, the use of machine learning suggests that neural networks or evolutionary algorithms may be involved. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper does not focus on software engineering, but it may be relevant to the development of software for distribution system operators to efficiently plan and operate the contributions of DERs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
