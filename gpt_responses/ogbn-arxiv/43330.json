The proposed denoising schemes draw from nonparametric density estimation techniques, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed schemes in denoising gray-scale images (cs.CV) and considers various noise distributions (cs.SP, cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
