The proposed framework also aims to evaluate the quality of microservices-based systems, which is a key concern in software engineering. \n\n2. cs.SD (Software Development) - The paper focuses on the decomposition of monolithic systems into microservices, which is a key aspect of software development. The proposed framework also aims to evaluate the quality of microservices-based systems, which is relevant to software development. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - Microservices are a form of distributed computing, and the paper deals with the decomposition of monolithic systems into microservices. The proposed framework also aims to evaluate the quality of microservices-based systems, which is relevant to distributed computing. \n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes a decomposition system based on business process mining, which involves analyzing the behavior of a system. This is relevant to programming languages, which deal with the behavior of programs. \n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The proposed framework involves measuring and evaluating the quality of microservices-based systems, which can be seen as a problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper also proposes a decomposition system based on business process mining, which involves analyzing"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
