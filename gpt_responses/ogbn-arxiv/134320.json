The specific problems addressed in the paper, namely the distance-r dominating set and distance-r independent set problems, are related to graph algorithms and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) as well as data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses restricted graph classes, such as map graphs and biclique-free graphs, which are related to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
