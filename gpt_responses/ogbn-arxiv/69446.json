The corpus also includes self-paced reading time data, which suggests that it may be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper mentions that the corpus is annotated with parse trees, which could be of interest to researchers in the subfield of natural language processing (cs.CC). Finally, the paper notes that the corpus includes low-frequency syntactic constructions, which could be relevant to researchers studying neural networks (cs.NE) and their ability to handle rare or unusual inputs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
