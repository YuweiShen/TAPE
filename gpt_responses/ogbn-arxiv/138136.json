This involves using a deep lattice network model to enhance interpretability and adding monotonicity constraints between inputs-and-outputs. The proposed set function is then used to automate the engineering of dense, interpretable features from sparse categorical features. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
