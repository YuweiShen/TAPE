The use of clique-width as a parameter is a common technique in algorithm design and analysis, and it is closely related to graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
