The paper proposes a novel Localization Guided Network to address the problem of localizing the areas corresponding to different attributes. This involves assigning attribute-specific weights to local features based on the affinity between proposals pre-extracted proposals and attribute locations. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
