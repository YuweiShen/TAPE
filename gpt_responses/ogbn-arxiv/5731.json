The fact that the problem is shown to be NP-complete and has been studied in the context of parameterized complexity also supports these categories. However, since the paper specifically focuses on the planar case, cs.CG and cs.GT seem more likely than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
