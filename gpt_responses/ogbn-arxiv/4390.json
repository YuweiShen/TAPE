This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) and computational economics (cs.EC). The paper also discusses the use of simple mechanisms and approximation algorithms, which are common topics in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of logarithmic or constant number of additional buyers, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and communication complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
