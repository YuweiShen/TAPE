The proposed method involves learning visibility-aware part-level features, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves self-supervision and learning, which are common themes in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves experiments and evaluation, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with a realistic problem and proposes a new method, which may involve some security and cryptography (cs.CR) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
