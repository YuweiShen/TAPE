As such, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\nFirstly, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is a likely category as the paper focuses on improving the user experience of VR, which is a key aspect of HCI research. \n\nSecondly, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is also a likely category as the paper leverages WiFi infrastructure for tracking purposes. \n\nThirdly, cs.MM (Multimedia) is a possible category as the paper deals with improving the multimedia experience of VR. \n\nFourthly, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is a possible category as the paper proposes a new system for position tracking in VR. \n\nFinally, cs.IT (Information Theory) is a possible category as the paper uses WiFi signals to estimate position, which involves signal processing and information theory concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
