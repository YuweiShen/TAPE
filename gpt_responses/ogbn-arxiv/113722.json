It proposes a novel end-to-end hybrid-supervised object detection system that utilizes both fully and weakly-annotated data, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The proposed system also involves the use of class activation heat-maps and auxiliary heads, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
