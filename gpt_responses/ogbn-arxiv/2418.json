Additionally, the paper discusses adversarial training, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) to improve model robustness. The paper also mentions the use of Fourier transform, which is a common signal processing technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper deals with adversarial attacks and defenses, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the IJCAI-2019 Alibaba Adversarial AI Challenge, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves image and video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
