The paper proposes a new regularization method for a state-of-the-art KBC method called Complex Embeddings, which is a type of machine learning model that learns vector representations of entities and relations in a knowledge base. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.AI, which covers topics related to AI and machine learning. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of scoring functions to estimate the likelihood of relations between entities, which is a common approach in KBC. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (machine learning), cs.CL (computation and language), and cs.IR (information retrieval), which all deal with aspects of machine learning and natural language processing. \n\nFinally, the paper focuses on improving the efficiency of Complex Embeddings by reducing the number of parameters needed to represent symmetric and antisymmetric relations. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-category cs.DB (databases), which deals with the storage and retrieval of large amounts of data. \n\nOverall, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.DB, and cs.IR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
