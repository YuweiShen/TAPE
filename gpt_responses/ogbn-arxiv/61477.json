The use of graph theory and the introduction of a new formalism suggest that the paper could be relevant to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category covers research on the analysis and modeling of social networks, which often involves the study of interactions over time. The paper's focus on graph concepts and their generalization is relevant to this area.\n- cs.SD (Software Development and Programming): This sub-category covers research on software engineering, which can include the development of tools and frameworks for modeling and analyzing data. The paper's introduction of a new formalism for interactions over time could be relevant to this area.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures, which can be applied to various domains. The paper's use of graph concepts and their generalization could be relevant to this area.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers research on the design and analysis of systems, which can include the modeling of dynamic processes. The paper's focus on interactions over time and the consideration of discrete versus continuous time assumptions could be relevant to this area.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
