This involves designing a new SOT-MRAM cell, full addition design, and floating point computation. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a new technology (SOT-MRAM) for DNN training acceleration. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a new hardware architecture for DNN training acceleration. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper focuses on DNN training acceleration, which is a subfield of neural computing. \n- cs.EM (Electromagnetism): The paper involves the use of spin orbit torque, which is a phenomenon in electromagnetism. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a new accelerator for DNN training, which is a subfield of parallel computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
