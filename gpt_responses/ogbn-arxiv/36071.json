It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as hand pose estimation is important for human-robot interaction. The use of multi-view projections and fusion of heat-maps suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories may also be relevant. Finally, the use of learned pose priors suggests that the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
