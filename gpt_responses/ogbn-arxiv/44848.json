The paper also discusses the use of permutation and diffusion stages, which are common techniques in information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on image encryption, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
