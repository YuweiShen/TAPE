The algorithm uses an effort-based approach to minimize robot efforts, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The algorithm is also adaptable to unexpected environment changes, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
