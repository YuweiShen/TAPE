The experiments are conducted on deep convolutional neural networks for classification tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also introduces a new algorithm for training neural networks, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
