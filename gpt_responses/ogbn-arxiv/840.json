This involves training each level of the hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the lower level policies are already optimal. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
