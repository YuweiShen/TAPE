The proposed method utilizes human pose detection, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The goal of the work is to better understand a child's attitude and attention, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of deep neural networks for classification is a key aspect of the proposed method, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
