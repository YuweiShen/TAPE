The paper proposes a new method to use monolingual data for NMT training by combining the scores of a pre-trained language model (LM) with the scores of a translation model (TM). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also involves training neural networks, which falls under the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper mentions using image features for NMT, which falls under the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
