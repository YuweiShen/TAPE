Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also proposes a framework that uses multiple radios, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for ML estimation could also place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper's focus on robustness to channel SNR could suggest that it belongs to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
