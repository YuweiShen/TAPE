The paper focuses on clustering similar features within a field to reduce the embedding matrix size, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed method is implemented and evaluated on a distributed machine learning system, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.DB (Databases) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
