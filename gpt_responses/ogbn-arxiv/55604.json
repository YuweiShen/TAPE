The use of a multi-layer perceptron for the pixel-wise mapping suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The evaluation of the proposed method on depth maps and tree height maps suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
