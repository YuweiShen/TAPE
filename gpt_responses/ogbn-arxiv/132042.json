The paper uses recent advances in parameterized complexity to obtain tight lower bounds for these problems. The topics covered in the paper are closely related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), computational geometry (cs.CG), machine learning (cs.LG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
