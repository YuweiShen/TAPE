The proposed approach uses appearance-based temporal features with multi-CNN, which involves deep learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also introduces a new large-scale dataset for video surveillance, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of incomplete representation, which is a security concern and falls under cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
