Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also leverages the iterative quantization technique well established for image retrieval, which suggests a possible fit with cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also deals with compression, which is a topic that falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses pre-trained embeddings, which are often used in computer vision tasks, suggesting a possible fit with cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
