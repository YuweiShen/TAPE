The paper also discusses the use of kernel feature mapping and boundary construction, which are relevant to neural networks and computer vision (cs.NE, cs.CV). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed classifiers on benchmark datasets from different disciplines, which could fall under the category of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
