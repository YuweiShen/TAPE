The paper also presents a novel algorithm for clone detection, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software development (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper investigates the occurrence of faults induced by inconsistent changes to cloned code, which is relevant to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper is based on a large-scale case study, which is a common approach in software engineering research (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
