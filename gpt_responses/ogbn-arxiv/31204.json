The use of algebraic automata theory and systems of linear inequalities suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the study of forbidden constructions and the characterization of languages recognized by different models of automata may be of interest to the theory of computation (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
