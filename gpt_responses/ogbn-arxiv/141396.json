The use of domain randomization and gradient-based search methods for training these policies involves machine learning techniques, which could fall under categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the practicality of training finite capacity models, which could relate to the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
