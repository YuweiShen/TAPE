This falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO) categories. The paper also discusses reduction theory, which is a technique used in distributed computing (cs.DC) and abstraction mechanisms, which are commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE) and computer architecture (cs.AR). Therefore, these categories are also likely candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
