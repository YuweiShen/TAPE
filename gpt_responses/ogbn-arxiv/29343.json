The paper focuses on the development of an adaptive monitoring algorithm based on three approaches for optimizing resource usage. The approaches used in the framework provide a deep knowledge about the person's context by considering the person's profile, the activities, and the relationships between activities. The paper also evaluates the performance of the framework and shows its adaptability and significant reduction in network, energy, and processing usage over a traditional monitoring implementation. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
