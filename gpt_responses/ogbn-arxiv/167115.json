The approach focuses on multi-shot re-id problem, which is a prevalent problem in many video analytics applications. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a Variational Bayesian based inference procedure, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper deals with video analytics, which can be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also introduces a sparse, non-stationary noise term in the model error to deal with time varying outliers and occlusions, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of person re-identification, which can be categorized under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
