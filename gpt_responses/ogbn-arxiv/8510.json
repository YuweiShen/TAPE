It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it involves the development of a new architecture for machine learning models. The use of group convolutions and weight initialization schemes also suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of steerable filters and orientation-dependent responses suggests that it may belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
