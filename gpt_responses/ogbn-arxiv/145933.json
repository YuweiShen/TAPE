Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also addresses the need to work on aggregate data in external memory, which is a common challenge in large-scale ML applications, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The use of negative sampling and window sampling is a common technique in word embedding models, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of the modifications using word similarity and analogy tasks, which are common evaluation metrics in NLP, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible category. Finally, the use of external memory and positional contexts can also be relevant to neural network architectures, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
