The paper specifically discusses view-dependence effects in visual psychophysics and inferotemporal cortex physiology, as well as episodic memory recall interference effects associated with the medial temporal lobe. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
