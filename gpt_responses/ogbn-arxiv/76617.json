The paper uses geometric techniques and convex relaxations to design efficient algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained convex minimization, which is a common optimization technique in cryptography and could place the paper in the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the Grothendieck inequality from functional analysis to design the relaxations, which could suggest that it belongs to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
