The paper also discusses the complexity of deciding the existence of such equilibria for various classes of objectives. This aligns with the scope of Game Theory.\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with omega-regular objectives, which are a class of temporal logic formulas. The paper also presents algorithms for deciding the existence of equilibria, which involves logical reasoning. Hence, it is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new notion of equilibria that can be used in reactive synthesis, which is a problem in AI. The paper also discusses the complexity of deciding the existence of such equilibria, which is relevant to AI.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents algorithms for deciding the existence of equilibria for various classes of objectives. This aligns with the scope of Data Structures and Algorithms.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of equilibria in reactive synthesis, which is a problem in control theory. The paper also proposes a new notion of equilibria that can be used in such applications. Hence, it is likely to belong to this"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
