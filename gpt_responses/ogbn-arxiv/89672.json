The use of Latin Squares in the proposed scheme also involves combinatorial optimization (cs.CC) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of multiple access interference, which is a common issue in wireless communication systems and falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
