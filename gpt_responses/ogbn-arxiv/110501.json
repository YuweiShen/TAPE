This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of extrinsic Jensen-Shannon (EJS) divergence and sequential transmission schemes, which are relevant to the statistical learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also involves simulations and non-asymptotic bounds, which are related to the computer science and computational complexity (cs.CC) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
