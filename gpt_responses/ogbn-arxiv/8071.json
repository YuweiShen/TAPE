The study investigates the impact of access point (AP) and blockage height on the line of sight (LOS) probability, which is a key aspect of network performance. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of high-rise APs to enhance LOS coverage in mm-wave systems. This involves optimizing the placement of APs to maximize the probability of maintaining a LOS link, which can be viewed as an information-theoretic problem. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions the need for high data rates to support immersive experiences in 5G networks. This suggests that multimedia applications are a key driver for the research. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper proposes a solution for enhancing LOS coverage by using coordinated high-rise APs jointly deployed with low-rise APs. This involves optimizing the placement of APs to improve network connectivity, which can be viewed as a social network problem. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper does not focus on hardware architecture, but it does mention the use of street furniture (e.g., lamp poles) for deploying low-rise APs. This suggests that hardware considerations may be relevant to the research"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
