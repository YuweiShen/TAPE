The paper also focuses on the application of this method to rule-based modelling, which is a subfield of computational biology that involves modelling molecular interactions and signalling pathways (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of stochastic chemical kinetics, which is a topic in computational statistics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the applicability of the method to large signalling pathways, which falls under the category of control engineering (cs.SY) and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
