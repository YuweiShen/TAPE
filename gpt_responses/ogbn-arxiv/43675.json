The paper also mentions the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. \n\nThe use of adaptive strategies to eliminate noisy proposals and generate pseudo object-level annotations could also suggest the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. \n\nThe proposed approach involves multiple instance learning, which is a common technique in multimedia analysis and retrieval, placing it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves optimization techniques to re-weight detection results, which could suggest the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
