It is likely to be categorized under Programming Languages (cs.PL) as it introduces a new language construct. It may also be relevant to Software Engineering (cs.SE) as it discusses the representation of objects with mutually exclusive procedures. Additionally, it touches on Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) as it proposes a new semantics for the choice-conjunctive declaration statement. It may also be relevant to Language and Computation (cs.LG) as it discusses the representation of procedures in a language. Finally, it may be relevant to Systems and Control (cs.SY) as it proposes a new statement for controlling the behavior of a system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
