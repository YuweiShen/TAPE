It proposes a distributed encoding scheme based on the asynchronous partitioned global address space (APGAS) parallel programming model, which is evaluated on a cluster of up to 384 cores and datasets of up to 11 billion triples. This work involves aspects of data compression, database systems, distributed systems, programming languages, and performance evaluation, which are all relevant to the aforementioned sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DB (Databases), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
