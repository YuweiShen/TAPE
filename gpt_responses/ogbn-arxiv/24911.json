The paper proposes a novel method for efficient network embedding by compressing the input graph and using the compressed graph for embedding. This method can be applied to various state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms based on random walks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
