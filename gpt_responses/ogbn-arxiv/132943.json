Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes solutions using scripts, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses identifying and removing problematic sentences, which involves information retrieval techniques, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as it discusses the impact of data quality on models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
