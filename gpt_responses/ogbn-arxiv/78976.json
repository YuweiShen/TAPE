The proposed approach involves developing an interference detection algorithm at the MAC layer and using Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements to identify congestion and select alternative paths for data transmission. The performance of the protocol is measured using the Coefficient of Restitution (COR) parameter. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory) for the use of RTT measurements, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) for addressing interference issues, cs.MM (Multimedia) for the use of MRMC, and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) for the focus on improving network throughput performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
