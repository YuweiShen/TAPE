The paper also mentions popular machine learning packages such as TensorFlow and Autograd. \n\nThe paper also discusses source code transformation, which is a technique used in software engineering (cs.SE) to modify source code without changing its behavior. \n\nThe use of abstractions to inject logic into the generated gradient code suggests that the paper may also belong to the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the scientific computing (cs.SC) sub-category as it discusses numerical functions and their derivatives. \n\nFinally, the paper may belong to the control systems (cs.SY) sub-category as it discusses the generation of new functions based on existing ones, which is a common technique in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
