The use of submodular optimization techniques and linear programming reformulation points towards the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of cooperative control of complex systems suggests that the paper could also belong to the category of Game Theory and Economics (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
