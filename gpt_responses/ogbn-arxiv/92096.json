The paper presents a new approach for evaluating queries with multi-way theta-joins under updates, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the database community. Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces new algorithms and generalizations of existing concepts, which may be of interest to researchers in the areas of data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
