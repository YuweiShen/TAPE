The use of deep learning and neural networks in the platform also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The platform uses a monocular camera for perception, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the platform also involves distributed computing and control systems, which could be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
