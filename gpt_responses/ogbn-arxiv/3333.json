The paper also discusses the use of a GPU cluster, which could fall under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The training is done on ImageNet, which is a popular dataset for computer vision tasks, indicating that computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a relevant sub-category. The paper specifically addresses the overhead of gradient synchronization, which suggests that distributed systems (cs.Distributed) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of batch-size control and label smoothing, which are techniques used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
