This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as well as computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for place recognition, which could fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the dataset includes both built environments and vegetated areas, suggesting that it may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
