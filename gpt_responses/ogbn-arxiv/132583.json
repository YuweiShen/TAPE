The algorithm is based on geometrical concepts and uses Incomplete Cholesky decomposition with pivot selection based on least-angle regression. The paper focuses on the application of the algorithm to kernel-based learning algorithms, which is a common topic in the machine learning community (cs.LG). The algorithm's linear complexity in the number of data points and kernels makes it suitable for large datasets, which is also relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also includes experiments on regression datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
