This is a classic computer vision problem.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper claims to not use any labeled training data of crashes, it still uses machine learning techniques to predict and recognize car crashes. Therefore, this category is also likely.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on real-time proactive safety checks of speeds and distances between vehicles suggests a connection to robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper's focus on identifying high-risk areas and predicting car crashes could also be relevant to security and safety concerns in transportation systems.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's use of machine learning and predictive modeling techniques falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
