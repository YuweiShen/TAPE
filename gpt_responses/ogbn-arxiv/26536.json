The use of OFDM signals is also a common technique in wireless communication, which further supports the likelihood of these categories. The paper also mentions the use of Monte Carlo simulations, which is a common tool in statistical inference (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a low complexity suboptimal solution, which may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
