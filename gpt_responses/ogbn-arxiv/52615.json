The use of multiple antennas for multicasting also suggests a potential fit for the multimedia sub-category (cs.MM). The consideration of side information at the transmitter and receivers suggests a potential fit for the signal processing sub-category (cs.SI) and the networked systems sub-category (cs.NI). Finally, the discussion of robust dirty paper coding suggests a potential fit for the cryptography and security sub-category (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
