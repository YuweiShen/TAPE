Therefore, cs.IR and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of deep neural network embedding vectors, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes efficient data structures, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
