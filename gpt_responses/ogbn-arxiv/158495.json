This involves modeling the release of molecules by biological entities as a compound Poisson process and analyzing the noise observed at the receiver. This work involves aspects of information theory (cs.IT) in terms of analyzing the performance of the DMC system, as well as aspects of neuroscience (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY) in terms of modeling the biological entities and the DMC system. The paper also involves mathematical analysis (cs.MA) in terms of characterizing the noise from the CPNS and formulating the ML detector. Finally, the paper deals with healthcare applications (cs.BIO) in terms of the motivation for the study."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
