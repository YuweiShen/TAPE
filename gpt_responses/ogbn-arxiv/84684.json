The use of coreset constructions and approximation algorithms suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and approximation algorithms (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of a data structure for maintaining a summary of the current window suggests a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
