The use of variational inference and marginal probability estimates also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of solvers on random k-SAT instances, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
