Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves information theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible sub-category. The use of minimization problems and bounds on leakage could be related to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages), respectively. Finally, the study of channels and observables could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
