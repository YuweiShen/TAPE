Additionally, the paper discusses the design of a low latency multi-access scheme for edge learning, which involves communication and networking aspects, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of opportunistic scheduling, which falls under the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper discusses the synchronization of edge-server and on-device learning, which involves control and system aspects, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of real datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
