Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper mentions real text datasets, indicating a potential connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses efficiency and speed, which are common concerns in distributed computing (cs.DC) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions compressed graphs, which could be related to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
