Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves geometrical optical analysis, which falls under the category of cs.GR (Graphics). The use of a specifically designed CNN-LSTM network suggests the involvement of machine learning, which falls under the categories of cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of capturing geometric continuity, which involves the use of epipolar plane images, suggesting the involvement of robotics and automation, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
