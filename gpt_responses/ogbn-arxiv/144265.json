The paper also discusses the preservation of the symmetric capacity region, which is a topic of interest in the field of signal processing (cs.SI). The use of polar codes for error correction and decoding involves computational complexity, which is a topic of interest in the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the performance of polar codes in the context of multiple access channels, which is a topic of interest in the field of networked systems and protocols (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
