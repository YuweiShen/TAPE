The use of game-theoretic concepts and the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework suggest that the paper may be of interest to researchers in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on measuring overlapping information content and similarities in representations of a target variable may also appeal to researchers in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of entropy and information measures may make the paper relevant to researchers in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
