The paper proposes an end-to-end trained two-step generation model that includes a sentence-level content planner and a surface realization decoder. This model can be applied to various tasks in different domains with varying language styles. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also involves deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The model's training process involves optimization and parameter tuning, which are also relevant to neural networks and optimization algorithms (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the model's performance using automatic evaluation metrics and human judges, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, the other likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
