This problem is a classic one in robotics (cs.RO) and involves optimization techniques and algorithms (cs.AI). The paper also deals with resource constraints and coordination of multiple robots (cs.SY). The use of Gaussian Processes and mutual information to quantify the amount of information collected suggests a machine learning (cs.MA) and statistical learning (cs.LG) approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
