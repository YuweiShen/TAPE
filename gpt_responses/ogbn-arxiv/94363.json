This falls under the domain of robotics, specifically manipulation planning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a high-level sampling-based planning framework, which is a common technique in AI for solving complex planning problems. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although not the main focus of the paper, computer vision techniques may be used to perceive the object and its environment, which can aid in the planning process. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper uses an inverse contact dynamics solver to model the frictional interaction between the gripper, grasped object, and pusher. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While not explicitly mentioned in the paper, machine learning techniques may be used to improve the performance of the planner, such as learning a policy for selecting pushes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
