The paper also discusses the use of pre-training and transfer learning, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper focuses on medical imaging applications, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of pre-training with surrogate supervision, which is a technique that involves training a model on unlabeled data, making it relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
