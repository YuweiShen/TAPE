This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of Random Matrix Theory to approximate the quadratic form $\\beta$ suggests that the paper may also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) or Matrix Analysis (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on convergence and the behavior of a Gaussian random variable suggests that it may also belong to the Statistics (cs.ST) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, but these are less likely than the other categories mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
