The paper proposes an evaluation methodology for NLI models, which involves constructing \"stress tests\" to examine the models' ability to make real inferential decisions. This methodology is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, since the focus of the paper is on NLP and language understanding, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
