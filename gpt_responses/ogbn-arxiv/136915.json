This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses in-network filtering and proposes a practical deployment model for Internet exchange points (IXPs). This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a system for verifiable in-network filtering using trusted execution environments (TEEs). This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses parallelizing TEE-based filters to handle larger traffic volumes and more complex filtering operations. This falls under the domain of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a software-defined architecture for Internet exchange points (IXPs) as a practical deployment model for the verifiable filters.
