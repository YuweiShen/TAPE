The paper also discusses the construction and verification of the program, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of approximate specifications and semantics-preserving program transformations suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves proofs and systematic approaches, which are common in the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's title includes the term \"Logic Control,\" which is a common phrase in the category of logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
