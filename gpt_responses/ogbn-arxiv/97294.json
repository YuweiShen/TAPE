This involves dealing with uncertainty in the Duration-of-Stay (DoS) method, which is a central problem in warehousing. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new framework that uses deep neural networks to optimize storage assignment, which falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's use of deep neural networks to optimize storage assignment can also be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper's use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be considered as an application of computer vision. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on optimizing storage assignment in warehousing can be considered as an application of robotics, as warehousing often involves the use of robots. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper's focus on optimizing storage assignment can also be considered as an application of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
