The use of transmission graphs and the complexity class $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$ suggest that the paper may also be relevant to theoretical computer science (cs.CC) and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the application of the results to networks of directional antennas may indicate a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
