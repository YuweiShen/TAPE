Therefore, cs.IT and cs.COMM are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the implementation cost and complexity, which could fall under the categories of distributed systems (cs.DS) and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents simulation results, which could be related to computer science and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
