The proposed method involves clustering and estimation using constraints, which are techniques commonly used in graph theory (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of prior knowledge to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
