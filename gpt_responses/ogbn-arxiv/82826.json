This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also proposes a novel interpretation of feature transform as an optimal transport problem, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the relation of their formulation with previous works like Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) and Whitening and Coloring Transform (WCT), which are also related to computer graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
