Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the use of surrogate gradient methods, which are commonly used in deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions real-world signal processing problems, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
