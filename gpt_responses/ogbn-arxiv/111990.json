This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The proposed solution involves clustering and ranking techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of a joint cost function to balance two distances, which is a statistical learning problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
