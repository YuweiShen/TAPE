This work is highly relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY), as well as to the subfield of modeling and simulation (cs.MS). The paper also discusses the use of formal abstractions, which is a common technique in the field of logic and verification (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multi-threading and symbolic construction, which are techniques commonly used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
