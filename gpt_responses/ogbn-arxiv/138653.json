This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. However, the paper also mentions applications to information retrieval (IR) and data mining (DM), which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DM (Data Mining) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves some combinatorial and geometric concepts, such as maximal locations and copies, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
