The focus on hyper-parameter tuning and optimization also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.NE). The use of game-playing as a testbed for the algorithm suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT) and computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant for analyzing the game states."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
