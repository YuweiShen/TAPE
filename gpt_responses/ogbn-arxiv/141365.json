This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses techniques from computer algebra and satisfiability checking, which are areas of computer science that are often associated with the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Symbolic Computation (cs.SC), and Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
