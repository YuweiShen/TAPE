It discusses the split bearer architecture of Dual Connectivity (DC) and its impact on the delay and blocking probability of foreground and background users. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the optimal policy for traffic splitting in LTE based heterogeneous networks to minimize the average delay of the system subject to a constraint on the blocking probability of foreground and background users. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a policy to optimize the system performance of LTE based heterogeneous networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the impact of Dual Connectivity on the delay of the system, which is an important factor in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not directly deal with cryptography and security, but the optimization of traffic splitting policy in heterogeneous networks can have implications for network security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
