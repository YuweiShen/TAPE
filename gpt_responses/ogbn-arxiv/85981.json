This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The method uses convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and involves learning contextual relationships between objects in images (cs.AI). Finally, the paper applies the method to prevailing models of popular tasks such as image captioning and VQA (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
