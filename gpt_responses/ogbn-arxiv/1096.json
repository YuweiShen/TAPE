This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with the control and navigation of robots. The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of lidar measurements, which suggests that it may fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the coordination and communication between multiple robots, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
