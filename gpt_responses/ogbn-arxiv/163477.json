Computer vision techniques such as segmentation and feature extraction are used in the method. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the classification of foliar damages into two categories (rust or leaf miner) using an artificial neural network. This can be seen as a form of information retrieval, where the system retrieves information about the type of damage from the input image. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses an artificial neural network trained with extreme learning machine for the classification of foliar damages. This falls under the category of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the development of an AI-based system for the detection and classification of foliar damages. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the analysis of images of coffee leaf captured using a smartphone. This can be seen as a form of computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
