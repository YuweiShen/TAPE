Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses interference and resource management, which are related to information theory, so cs.IT (Information Theory) is also likely. Additionally, the paper uses experimental evaluations, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), and proposes a solution for improved co-existence, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
