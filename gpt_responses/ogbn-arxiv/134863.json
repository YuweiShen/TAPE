The paper also proposes a new method for selecting training samples, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the necessity of tiling multiple anchors per location on the image, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses statistical characteristics of objects to improve performance, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
