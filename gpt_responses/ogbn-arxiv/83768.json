The paper proposes a nonparametric framework for conducting optimization over all possible network sizes, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also introduces a novel optimization algorithm, which is a topic that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper applies the proposed framework to train neural networks for image classification, which is a topic that falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed framework in control systems, which is a topic that falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
