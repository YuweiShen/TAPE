This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with detecting and preventing fraudulent activities. Additionally, the paper proposes an unsupervised method for identifying botted broadcasts, which involves analyzing large datasets, making it relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also deals with analyzing video content, making it relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of the proposed method, making it relevant to the sub-category of computer systems and networking (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
