The paper also discusses the principles of design-by-contract, which is a software engineering technique. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of formal specifications and assertions in programming, which is a key aspect of programming languages. The paper also discusses the use of a verifying compiler, which is a tool used in programming language research. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the use of formal reasoning and verification in software development, which is a key aspect of logic in computer science. The paper also discusses the use of verification conditions and an integrated prover, which are tools used in logic-based verification. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses the use of an integrated Web IDE, which is a technology that is becoming increasingly popular in software development. The paper also discusses the use of a verifying compiler, which is a technology that is becoming increasingly important in software development. \n- cs.EDU (Computer Science Education): The paper discusses the use of an IDE and a verifying compiler in a classroom setting, which is a key aspect of computer science education. The paper also discusses the iterative process of creating and refining assertions, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
