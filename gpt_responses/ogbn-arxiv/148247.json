The concepts of envy-freeness and maximin share fairness are also well-studied in game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses graph-theoretic tools and concepts to study fair division problems. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Fair division is a problem that arises in many AI applications, such as resource allocation and task assignment. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may be relevant to machine learning applications that involve fair allocation of resources. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): Fair division is a problem that arises in multiagent systems, where multiple agents need to share resources fairly."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
