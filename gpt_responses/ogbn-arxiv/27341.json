The paper also extensively discusses the use of echo state networks, which is a type of recurrent neural network (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the training and implementation of the network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the fundamental cryptographic properties of diffusion and confusion, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes a practical implementation of the scheme, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
