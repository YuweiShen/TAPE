The paper focuses on the use of bias-shifted neural networks for constructing the controller and training the network in the simulator. This technique is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
