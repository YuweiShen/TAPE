The paper proposes a new system for detecting malware in Android native code, which involves analyzing control flow patterns. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL), as it involves developing a new tool for analyzing code. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing malware detection tools, which suggests that it may be relevant to systems and software development (cs.SD) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), as these fields often involve developing tools and techniques for analyzing large amounts of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
