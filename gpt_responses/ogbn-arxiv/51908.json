The paper also mentions various normalization techniques, which are commonly used in data mining and database management (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper proposes a new normalization technique, which involves manipulating data, a common task in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of preprocessing in general, which is a key aspect of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
