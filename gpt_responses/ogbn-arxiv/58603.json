The use of nonlinear strategies and the analysis of their performance suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The consideration of alternative formulations and extensions of the Witsenhausen counterexample may also involve game theory (cs.GT) and dynamical systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
