Additionally, his work on functional programming languages (such as the ML family) and higher-order logic make categories such as programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE) likely as well. His work on hardware verification and system design also make categories such as architecture (cs.AR) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
