This falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The approach proposed involves using deep learning techniques for visual representation learning (cs.CV) and domain adaptation (cs.LG), as well as reinforcement learning for policy search (cs.AI) and evaluating the approach on a manipulation task with a PR2 robot (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
