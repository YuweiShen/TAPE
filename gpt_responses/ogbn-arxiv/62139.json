The proposed approach involves determining an optimal indexing schema and body-orderings for the Datalog rules, which requires machine learning and optimization techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the comparison of the new approach with standard execution plans, which involves experimental evaluation and analysis, commonly used in data science (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
