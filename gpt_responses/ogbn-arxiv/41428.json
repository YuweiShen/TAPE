The use of an artificial agent for learning an optimal registration strategy also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also proposes a greedy supervised approach for training the agent, which is a common technique in neural networks and optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the use of attention-driven hierarchical strategy for coping with the dimensionality of the problem is related to robotics and control (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
