Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) since the paper focuses on privacy-preserving estimation. The paper also involves the use of moment perturbation and composition methods, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT), respectively. Finally, the paper's application to Gaussian mixture models suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
