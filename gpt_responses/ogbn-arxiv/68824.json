This is a common problem in computer vision, which is typically categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which are often associated with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper focuses on applications in traffic surveillance and autonomous driving, which are areas of research that fall under cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper deals with object detection, which is a subfield of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
