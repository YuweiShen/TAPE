The paper also uses information theoretic techniques (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.DS) to prove its results. The Tribes function is a well-known problem in computational complexity theory, which is closely related to circuit complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's focus on communication networks and channels makes it relevant to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
