The paper also presents methods for reducing the computational complexity of solving interactive dynamic influence diagrams, which involves graphical models and probabilistic reasoning, making it relevant to the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
