It also discusses the application of quantum cognition in natural language processing (cs.CL) and the use of quantum structures to model data from psychological and corpus-text-based experiments, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions the reconstruction of entities of meaning from texts, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
