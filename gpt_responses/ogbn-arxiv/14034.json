The paper also deals with the challenges of decision making in a complex and uncertain environment, which is a key aspect of robotics (cs.RO). The use of deep learning techniques for decision making also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of environmental modeling and occupancy grids, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the implementation of the proposed architecture in actual self-driving cars, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
