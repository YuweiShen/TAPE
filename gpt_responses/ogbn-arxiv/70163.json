The paper proposes novel data-dependent excess risk bounds for vector-valued functions and a unified learning framework for them. These topics are closely related to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
