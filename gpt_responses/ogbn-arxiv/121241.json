Additionally, the paper uses navigation instructions as a probing tool, which is a common task in natural language processing. The paper also touches on machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper's use of a grounded environment and its focus on visual inputs may also make cs.CV (Computer Vision) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of recurrent networks and its focus on navigation may make cs.RO (Robotics) a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
