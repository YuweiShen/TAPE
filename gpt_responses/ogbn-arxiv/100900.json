The proposed method involves the use of a neural network architecture (cs.LG) that incorporates multi-resolution branches and a cascade feature fusion unit. The paper also discusses the use of label guidance to reduce computation (cs.AI) and evaluates the method on challenging datasets (cs.MM, cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
