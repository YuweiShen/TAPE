Therefore, the most likely category is cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), which includes EDA and hardware design. The paper also mentions the design of Boolean systems, which falls under the category of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). The use of solvers and optimization techniques suggests the category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also mentions combinatorial optimization, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions the use of component libraries, which suggests the category of cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
