The proposed mechanisms aim to improve the usefulness and soundness of the aggregated scores, which are key concerns in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). The paper also involves theoretical quantification of estimation error and manipulating risk, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes mechanisms that are more robust to adversarial attacks, which is a common problem in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
