The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods and proposes a new approach, which involves preserving structure patterns important to human perception, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in bypassing defense mechanisms, indicating a focus on computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses neural networks to generate the adversarial examples, indicating a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
