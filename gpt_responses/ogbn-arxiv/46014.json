The paper also introduces a new notion of dispersion and connects it to asymptotic convex geometry, which could be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's tools and results have applications in matrix problems and property testing, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
