The paper also introduces a new algorithm that takes into account multi-scale and multi-channel error representations, which involves signal processing (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The algorithm also considers the selective and hierarchical nature of the visual system, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
