The focus of the paper is on providing traceability for neuroimaging analyses, which involves the use of computational methods and algorithms, making it relevant to the categories of cybernetics (cs.CY), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of CRISTAL software for provenance management, which is a type of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) that deals with the tracking and recording of the history of data and processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
