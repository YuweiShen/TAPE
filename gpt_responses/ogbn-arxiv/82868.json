The application of this method is for sense-and-avoid of obstacles in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The method uses a deep recurrent convolutional neural network, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of a simulator for generating training data, which is relevant to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
