This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also considers the MIMO IC with an arbitrary number of antennas at each terminal, which relates to the networked systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses interference alignment-based achievability schemes, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper deals with the fundamental DoF regions of the MIMO IC, which relates to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of DoF regions under different CSI assumptions, which relates to the computer communication (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
