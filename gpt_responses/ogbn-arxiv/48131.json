This involves using computer vision techniques such as SLAM and ORB feature detection. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the potential applications of the endoscope tracking and 3D reconstruction for surgical navigation and augmented reality, which are relevant to the field of robotics in surgery. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves processing and analyzing image sequences captured by the endoscope, which falls under the category of multimedia. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the reconstruction of a 3D map of the surgical scene, which involves creating visual representations of the scene. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques such as ORBSLAM to estimate the endoscope location and 3D structure of the surgical scene."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
