The focus of the paper is on enabling AI-based edge computing, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of extreme quantization for compression, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a methodology for designing efficient networks, which could also fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
