This involves using high-fidelity simulation results to train the networks, which falls under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the use of neural networks for prediction is a common application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of state-of-the-art algorithms to prevent overfitting, which is a common concern in neural network training and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves the study of a physical process, which could potentially fall under the category of modeling and simulation (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
