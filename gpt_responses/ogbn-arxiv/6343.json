The paper proposes an interactive approach that actively selects pairs of candidates for the user to label, and uses Bayesian optimization to focus on high-quality candidates and integrate prior knowledge. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) and community question answering (cQA), which could place it in the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
