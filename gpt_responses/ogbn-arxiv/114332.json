This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the use of online versus just in training image augmentation, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the approach is demonstrated in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) (cs.RO), which is a subfield of robotics (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
