This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the Kolmogorov complexity, which is a concept from computational complexity theory (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the speed of transmission of secret information, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
