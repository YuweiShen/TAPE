This falls under the scope of algorithms and data structures. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses dynamic rankings and detection of network areas with high potential for activation, which are techniques commonly used in AI. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The paper deals with the activation of seed nodes in a social influence process, which can be seen as a multiagent system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
