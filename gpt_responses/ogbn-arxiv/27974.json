The use of Gaussian channels and the focus on capacity approximation also suggest the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of amplify-and-forward, which is a common technique in wireless communication, suggesting the sub-category of computer communications (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of bursty communication suggests the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM), which often deals with bursty data transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
