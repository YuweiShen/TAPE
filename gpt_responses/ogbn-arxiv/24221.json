Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes efficient and less resource-intensive strategies, which involves the use of pre-existing monolingual annotated resources for training. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deal with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Finally, the paper presents a data set of code-mixed tweets, which may also make it relevant to the sub-category cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
