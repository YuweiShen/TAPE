This makes it likely to belong to the categories of cryptography (cs.CR), information theory (cs.IT), coding theory (cs.CC), and group theory (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper discusses instantiations of the protocols using braid groups and their quotients, which suggests a possible connection to the category of symbolic computation (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
