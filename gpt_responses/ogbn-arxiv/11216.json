The algorithm is designed to solve unconstrained optimization problems and implements intra-group and inter-group learning mechanisms. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE). However, given the focus on optimization and the comparison with other optimization algorithms, cs.NE and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
