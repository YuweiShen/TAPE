The paper proposes a scalable non-parametric approach to automatically learn the structural dynamics of the network and individual nodes, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SD (Software Development) sub-category. The paper also mentions the identification of interesting node and network patterns, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. The paper deals with the analysis of large networks, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
