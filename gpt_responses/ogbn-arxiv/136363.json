Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic classifiers and global label costs, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its system on large-scale datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
