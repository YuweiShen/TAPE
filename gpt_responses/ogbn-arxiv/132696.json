This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and computers and society (cs.CY). However, since the paper focuses on the normalization of scholars from different scientific disciplines, we believe that cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SI, cs.CY, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
