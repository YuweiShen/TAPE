This involves modeling the primary disturbance to AVs as human-controlled vehicles making unsafe lane changes, and using importance sampling techniques to estimate the frequencies of conflicts, crashes, and injuries for a modeled AV. The approach is aimed at accelerating the verification of AVs in simulations and controlled experiments, and has the potential to greatly reduce the development and validation time for AVs. The paper thus falls under the categories of robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), machine learning (cs.LG), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
