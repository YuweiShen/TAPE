Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses unsupervised methods for part detection, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well. The use of deep learning and aggregation methods also makes it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, since the paper deals with image retrieval, it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
