The paper proposes a method that uses Bayesian optimization to learn contact schedule selection from high-level task descriptors. This involves defining a bi-level optimization in which a Gaussian process model predicts the performance of trajectories generated by a motion planning nonlinear program. The paper also provides results for planning single-legged hopping. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
