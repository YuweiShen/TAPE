The paper specifically focuses on semi-supervised training, which involves using both stereo image pairs and LiDAR point clouds to train the model. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO), as these fields often involve using sensor data to make predictions about the environment. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a loss function to improve the accuracy of the depth predictions, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the model on popular datasets, which is a common practice in computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
