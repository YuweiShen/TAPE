The use of constraints and solvers is also a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and simulation and modeling (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the solver in a programming language, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
