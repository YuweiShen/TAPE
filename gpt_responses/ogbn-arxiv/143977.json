The method utilizes on-board sensor measurements and prior knowledge of the road grade map, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The optimization of vehicle velocity also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
