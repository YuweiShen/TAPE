The paper also discusses transfer learning, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for policy representation also relates to computer vision (cs.CV), as visual perception is often a key component of robotic tasks. Finally, the paper discusses the sharing of robot-specific information, such as dynamics and kinematics, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
