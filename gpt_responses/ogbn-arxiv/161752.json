The use of sensing matrices and sparsity in levels signal model suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The focus on environmental conditions and distinct/identical sampling scenarios suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
