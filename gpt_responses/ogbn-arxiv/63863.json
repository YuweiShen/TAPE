The use of wavelets is also a common technique in image processing and analysis, which suggests the paper could also fit into the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR) or multimedia (cs.MM). The application of the method to locate gold nanoparticles in natural rubber samples suggests a possible fit with numerical analysis (cs.NA) or scientific computing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
