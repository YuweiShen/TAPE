The paper also discusses different ways of representing phrases, such as vectors and language models, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves using ranked lists of term weights, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data analysis (cs.CC).
