The paper also discusses the computational and memory burden of fully connected RNNs, which is a topic related to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE). The experiments conducted in the paper involve language modeling, speech recognition, and video action recognition, which are tasks related to natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
