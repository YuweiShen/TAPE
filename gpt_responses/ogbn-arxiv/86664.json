The paper also presents a new benchmark for hypergraphs, which is relevant to data structures and computational complexity. The experiments carried out with the new infrastructure involve machine learning and graph algorithms, which are topics covered in the machine learning and computer science theory sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
