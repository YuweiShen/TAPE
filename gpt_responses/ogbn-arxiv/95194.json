The proposed module also utilizes squeeze and excitation operations, which are commonly used in deep learning for improving model performance and reducing computational complexity, making categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) likely as well. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on improving recognition accuracy, which is a common goal in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
