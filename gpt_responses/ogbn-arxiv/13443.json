The use of large antenna-arrays and channel-reciprocity based downlink transmission suggests a focus on Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM). The use of Poisson Point Process (PPP) problem formulation and simulations suggest a focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
