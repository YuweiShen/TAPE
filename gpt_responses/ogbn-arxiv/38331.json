These tasks are typically encountered in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and control systems, which are covered by the arXiv sub-categories cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.AI, and cs.SY. Additionally, the paper involves the use of quasi-random designs and low-discrepancy point sets, which are commonly used in the field of computational statistics and optimization, covered by the arXiv sub-category cs.DS.
