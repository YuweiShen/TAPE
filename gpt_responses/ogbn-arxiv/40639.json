However, given that the paper focuses on data management and information retrieval, cs.DB and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories. The use of inverted indices and pruning techniques also suggests that the paper may be relevant to cs.DS (data structures and algorithms). The problem of detecting copying is also relevant to cs.CR (cryptography and security), as it can be used to identify plagiarism or intellectual property violations. Finally, the use of sampling strategies and iterative refinement suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (artificial intelligence), as these techniques are commonly used in machine learning and data mining."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
