Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also considers the impact of temporal correlation on the CSI, which is a common issue in wireless networks and communication systems, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a likely sub-category as well. The paper proposes a unified framework for encoding and interference quantization, which involves optimization and algorithm design, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) another possible sub-category. The paper also deals with antenna configurations and power allocation, which are related to signal processing and optimization, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves theoretical analysis and proof techniques, which are related to computer science and mathematics, making cs.COM (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
