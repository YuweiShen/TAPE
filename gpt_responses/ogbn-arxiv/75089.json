Computer vision techniques are used for automatic tracking of the tongue contour, which is then used to drive a 3D Finite Element Model. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper presents a novel method for 3D dynamic modeling of tongue deformation, which involves modal reduction and modal warping techniques. This is related to computer graphics and animation. \n3. cs.BIO (Computational Biology): The paper mentions applications in speech production, silent speech recognition, and speech disorder study. These are all related to computational biology and bioinformatics. \n4. cs.SD (Sound): The paper is related to the study of speech production and articulation training, which are related to sound and acoustics. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper's applications in speech production and articulation training involve human-computer interaction, as they may involve the use of interactive software or devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
