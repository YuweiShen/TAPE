The paper focuses on evaluating the proposed model on abstractive text summarization and data-to-text generation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses the encoder-decoder paradigm, which is a common technique in machine learning and natural language processing, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses exemplar-based retrieval, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper uses soft templates to construct an exemplar-specific decoder, which could also suggest that it belongs to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
