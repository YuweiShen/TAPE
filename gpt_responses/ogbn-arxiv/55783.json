This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) or Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a noise estimation building block for multimodal representation learning, which involves density estimation. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses benchmark datasets for two challenging multimodal tasks, which suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
