This involves adapting the practice reward parameters to reduce the extrinsic match reward loss computed from matches. The paper also evaluates the method on two games, Pong and PacMan, which are commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
