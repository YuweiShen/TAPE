The paper also employs some existing upper bounds on the capacity of binary deletion channels, which suggests that it may be related to network information theory (cs.NI) or signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) or machine learning (cs.LG) as deletion channels can arise in these contexts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
