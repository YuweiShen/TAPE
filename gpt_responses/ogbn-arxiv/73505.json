The use of fluidic actuators and the mention of pressure and force formulas suggest a focus on mechanical engineering. The paper also discusses the use of latex party balloons as a cheap alternative for initial design investigation, which suggests a focus on materials science and engineering. Finally, the mention of a customized soft actuator placed inside a single shell cavity with an open end for compression force suggests a focus on electrical and mechanical systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
