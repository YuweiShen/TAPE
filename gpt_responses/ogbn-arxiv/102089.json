This problem is fundamental to machine learning and multivariate statistics, and is relevant to a wide range of applications. The paper proposes a theoretically optimal and computationally efficient algorithm for recovering the moments of the eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix, and leverages this accurate moment recovery to show that the vector of eigenvalues can be accurately recovered. The paper provides finite-sample bounds on the expected error of the recovered eigenvalues, which imply that the estimator is asymptotically consistent as the dimensionality of the distribution and sample size tend towards infinity, even in the sublinear sample regime where the ratio of the sample size to the dimensionality tends to zero. The paper is likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the problem of spectrum estimation is fundamental to machine learning and the paper proposes an algorithm for solving this problem. The paper is also likely to be classified under cs.IT (Information Theory), as the paper uses a Wasserstein distance argument to show that the vector of eigenvalues can be accurately recovered. The paper is further likely to be classified under cs.ST (Statistics), as the problem of spectrum estimation is fundamental to multivariate statistics. The paper is also likely to be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
