The authors propose a Deep Neural Network (NN) to approximate the solution of the Advection-Diffusion (AD) PDE, which is a common technique in the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The problem of controlling the robot positions and release rates is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization, which is a typical problem in the field of control systems (cs.SY). The use of a Deep Neural Network for approximating the solution of the PDE involves training the network on a large dataset, which is a common technique in the field of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the authors propose a novel loss function that utilizes the variational form of the AD-PDE, which is a technique commonly used in the field of Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
