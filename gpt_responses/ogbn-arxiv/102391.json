This involves generating a solver for properties using the type definitions from the target program, which is a programming language-related task. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper addresses the challenge of reasoning over data-structure properties for real-world C programs, which is a software engineering problem. The proposed approach aims to detect errors in a wide range of data-structure manipulating programs, which is relevant to software quality assurance. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) as a logical framework for implementing the generated solver for data-structure properties. CHR is a declarative language for specifying constraint solvers, which is a topic of interest in logic and constraint programming. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with the analysis of graph-based data structures, which can be modeled as formal languages or automata. The proposed approach is shape neutral, meaning that it does not rely on specific graph shapes, which is a formal language-related property. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper focuses on the integrity of data structures and their manipulation in programs, which is a core topic in data structures and algorithms. The proposed approach aims to detect errors in a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
