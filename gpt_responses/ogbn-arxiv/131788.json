It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as EM is a commonly used method in AI. The paper also discusses experimental comparisons of different acceleration methods, which suggests it may belong to the data structures (cs.DS) or information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also belong to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category as EM is often used in network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
