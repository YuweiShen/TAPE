It may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with neural networks. Additionally, the paper mentions convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the use of higher-order information, which is relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the geometric approach to regularization, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
