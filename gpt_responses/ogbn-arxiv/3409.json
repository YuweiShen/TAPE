This involves modeling the drafting between two teams, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques such as MCTS suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
