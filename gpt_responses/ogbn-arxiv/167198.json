The paper also discusses the changes in execution models over time, which relates to the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The mention of distributed programming also suggests the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The use of formal semantics and graph transformations suggests the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and the use of state spaces suggests the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
