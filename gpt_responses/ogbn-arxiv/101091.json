The paper specifically focuses on the use of machine-learned models, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of electronic health records and data sources also suggests that it may fall under the category of databases (cs.DB) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of these models in real-world scenarios, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
