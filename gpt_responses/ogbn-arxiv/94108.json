This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) as hyperspectral data is a type of image data. The paper also discusses the use of self-training for sequential classification, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The incremental update of the IVM model without retraining from scratch involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and the deletion of noninformative samples is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
