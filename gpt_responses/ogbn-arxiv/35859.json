Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, it also discusses the potential advantages and drawbacks of the new technical features, which could fall under the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of augmented reality (cs.AR) and multimedia (cs.MM) in future WLAN scenarios, which could be relevant sub-categories. Finally, the discussion of network-level functionalities and their relation to other ongoing IEEE 802.11 amendments could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
