The paper also evaluates the proposed method on real-world datasets, which suggests that it may be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper perturbs training data labels, which is a technique that is commonly used in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between model capacity and generalization ability, which is a topic that is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
