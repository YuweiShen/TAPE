This approach allows for independent study of each feature and its impact on the event, as well as composition of features in arbitrary ways for aggregate impacts and \"what if\" scenarios. This suggests that the paper could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DB (Databases), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
