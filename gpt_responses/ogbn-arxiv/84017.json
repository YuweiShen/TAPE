This falls under the scope of computer vision.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the representation and simplification of 3D surfaces, which is a common topic in computer graphics.\n3. cs.MM (Mathematical Morphology): The paper proposes to use scale spaces of mathematical morphology to simplify fracture surfaces, which is a core topic in this sub-category.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a pipeline for simplifying fracture surfaces, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms such as distance transforms and morphological operations.\n5. cs.AR (Augmented Reality): While not directly related to AR, the paper's focus on archaeological fragments and their representation could potentially be applied to AR applications in the future."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
