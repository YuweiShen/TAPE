It may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it introduces computationally cheaper alternatives to existing power indices. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as power indices are often used in multi-agent systems and decision-making processes. The paper may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it studies the properties of a family of measures. Finally, it may be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as power indices are often used in network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
