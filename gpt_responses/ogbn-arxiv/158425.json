The paper also discusses the application of the framework to biological systems, which falls under the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses deep generative models, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
