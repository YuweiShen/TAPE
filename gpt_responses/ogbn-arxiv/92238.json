It may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it focuses on the geometry of parameter space induced by the symmetries of deep networks. Additionally, since the paper specifically mentions deep networks with rectifier units, it could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as these fields heavily use deep learning architectures with rectifier units. Finally, the paper's focus on the geometry of parameter space could also make it relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
