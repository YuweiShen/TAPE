The paper discusses the use of value learning to approximate the value function given only high-level objectives, which can be sparse and binary. This work involves robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV) as the robot may use vision to perceive its environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
