Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Game Theory and Economics). The paper also discusses the use of continuation passing style and selection functions, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also involves reasoning about properties of games in terms of their component parts, which is related to the study of data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions opportunities for generalization to learning agents, which is a topic in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
