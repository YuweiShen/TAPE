The paper discusses a taxonomy and set of descriptors for characterizing and assessing explainable systems along five dimensions. The paper also surveys the literature on explainable AI, including papers proposing new explainability algorithms and criteria from both computer science and social science perspectives. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses usability and safety, which are related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybersecurity (cs.CR), respectively. The paper also discusses validation and evaluation of explainability algorithms, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Therefore, the other likely sub-categories are cs.HC, cs.LG, cs.CY, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
