The paper proposes a pipeline-aware approach to hyperparameter tuning that maximizes reuse of work across pipelines. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), distributed and parallel computing (cs.DC), and software engineering (cs.SE). However, given the focus on machine learning pipelines, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CV, cs.DC, and cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
