The use of entropy measures also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The focus on innovation processes, which are often used in stochastic modeling, could also place the paper in the sub-category of stochastic processes (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
