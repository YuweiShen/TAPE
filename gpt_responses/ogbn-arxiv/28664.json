The paper proposes a supervised online hashing method, which involves learning from data in an incremental manner, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and stochastic optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on three widely-used benchmarks, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
