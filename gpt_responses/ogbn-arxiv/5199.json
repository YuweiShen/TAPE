The use of deep learning models also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for temporal super-resolution, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the recurrence of small space-time patches, which could be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
