It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. Additionally, it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as deep learning is a popular technique in AI research. The Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is also a possibility as neural networks are used in the paper. Finally, the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is a possibility as the paper deals with image classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
