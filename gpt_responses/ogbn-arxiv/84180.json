The use of compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms for signal detection suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the exploration of indexing opportunities in load modulated multiantenna systems suggests a possible connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
