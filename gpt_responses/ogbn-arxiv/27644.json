The proposed framework involves analyzing the activation patterns of dense layers in DNNs during classification, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) domains. The paper also mentions the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, which are commonly used in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) community.
