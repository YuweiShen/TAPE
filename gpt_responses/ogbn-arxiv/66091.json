The proposed models use embeddings, which are a popular technique in deep learning and natural language processing (cs.LG). The paper also deals with temporal data, which is a common topic in databases (cs.DB). The experiments involve evaluating the performance of the proposed models on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in natural language processing and machine learning (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval, as it involves inferring new facts from existing ones (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
