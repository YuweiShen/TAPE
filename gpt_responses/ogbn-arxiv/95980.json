The paper focuses on KG completion and correction, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework uses embedding models, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning, and thus the paper can also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are a type of database, and thus can be categorized under databases (cs.DB). The paper also proposes the use of textual evidence, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
