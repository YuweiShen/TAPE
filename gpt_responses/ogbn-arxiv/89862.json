The approach involves using a neural network to learn a correction term, which falls under the category of deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also applies the approach to two specific problems: fisheries management and pedestrian avoidance for autonomous driving, which are both related to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach empirically, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
