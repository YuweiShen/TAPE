The paper also proposes a multi-observer based estimation scheme, which involves machine learning techniques such as redundancy and data fusion, making it relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses the issue of attack detection and isolation, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of cybersecurity (cs.CR). The proposed scheme involves the use of observers, which are commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for state estimation and control. Finally, the paper presents simulation results to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme, which is relevant to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
