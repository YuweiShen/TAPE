The use of random code construction and modified asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) theorem also suggests a possible fit in the sub-category of statistical inference (cs.SI). The study of capacity under mismatched decoding may also fall under the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and cryptography and security (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
