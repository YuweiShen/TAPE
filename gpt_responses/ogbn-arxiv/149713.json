The paper also discusses the use of these divergences in k-means clustering, which is a popular algorithm in data science and falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the robustness of the proposed method to outliers, which is a common concern in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
