The use of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The mention of datasets and their importance in the success of recent methods suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the discussion of the merits and drawbacks of existing approaches and identification of promising avenues of research suggests that it could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
