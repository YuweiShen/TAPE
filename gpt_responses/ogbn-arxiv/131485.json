The paper focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of temporal convolutions and policy gradient methods suggests that it may also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. The application of the approach to randomized environments suggests that it may belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. Finally, the use of metalearning suggests that it may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
