The approach is implemented on KLEE, a symbolic execution engine for LLVM, which is a programming language infrastructure. Therefore, the paper may also belong to programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY) categories. The paper also evaluates the approach with program subjects used in previous data-flow testing literature, which indicates a focus on empirical studies and experiments, falling under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions a cloud-based unit testing service for industrial software, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) for developing the proposed tool."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
