The proposed benchmarks and metrics are aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of these shared controllers, which involves the use of AI techniques such as machine learning and human-computer interaction (cs.AI, cs.HC). The paper also mentions the application of these controllers in industrial settings, which suggests a systems engineering perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the proposed controller involves comparing it to a manually operated manipulator, which could involve the use of optimization techniques (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
