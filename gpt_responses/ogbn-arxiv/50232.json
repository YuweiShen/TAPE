The study also uses tools from applied topology to analyze the topological structure of the networks (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of the evolution of the networks over time, which could fall under the category of dynamic systems or temporal networks (cs.DS). The study also involves the analysis of community ratings of textbooks, which could fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper could also fall under the category of social and information networks, as it deals with the structure and evolution of networks of concepts (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
