The problem involves forming a given target pattern, which can be seen as a problem of Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Control (cs.SY). The paper also introduces a new notion of symmetricity in 3D-space, which can be seen as a contribution to Computational Geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper presents a pattern formation algorithm for oblivious FSYNC robots, which can be seen as a contribution to Concurrent, Distributed, and Parallel Computing (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
