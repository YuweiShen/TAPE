Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces new evaluation metrics, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The study also explores the effect of distortion on human visual attention, which could be relevant to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of visual saliency prediction to aid pooling of objective visual quality metrics could be related to cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the evaluation of existing models and the search for improved performance could be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
