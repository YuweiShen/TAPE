The proposed approach involves formulating detector training as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves updating hand-crafted anchor assignment, which can be seen as a form of feature engineering, a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of likelihood optimization, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the experiments involve the use of the COCO dataset, which is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
