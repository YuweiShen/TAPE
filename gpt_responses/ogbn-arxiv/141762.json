This falls under the scope of programming languages research.\n\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper formalizes an abstract model of \u03bb Actor programs called Actor Communicating System (ACS) which has a natural interpretation as a vector addition system. This involves the use of logic and falls under the scope of logic in computer science.\n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a flow-based, abstract semantics of \u03bb Actor programs, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms.\n\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents an approach to verify safety properties of concurrent programs automatically, which falls under the scope of software engineering.\n\n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper presents a formal model of \u03bb Actor programs called Actor Communicating System (ACS), which has a natural interpretation as a vector addition system.
