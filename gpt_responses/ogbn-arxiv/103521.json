The proposed solution involves designing an enhanced appified AV schema, which requires software engineering techniques (cs.SE) and system design (cs.SY) to ensure safety and security. The paper also mentions leveraging theory in the vehicle evaluation field, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the proposed solution. Finally, the paper discusses conducting program analysis techniques in the cybersecurity area, which falls under the category of cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
