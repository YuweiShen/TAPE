The methodology is applicable to general classes of graphs, including planar graphs, which suggests that the paper may also belong to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses coding schemes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
