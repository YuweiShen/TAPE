It also involves the use of consensus objects, which are commonly studied in the context of distributed systems and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper presents an affine task, which is a concept from algebraic topology and combinatorics (cs.LO). The use of immediate snapshot tasks and the characterization of models equipped with abstractions other than read-write memory involve information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
