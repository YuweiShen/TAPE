This falls under the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC), machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper presents lower bounds for such networks over Boolean inputs, which further supports the likelihood of it belonging to these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
