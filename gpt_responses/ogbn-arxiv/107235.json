It also studies the loss of accuracy in probabilistic settings between different temporal graph models. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet in dynamic random graphs, which are commonly used in networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the dynamics of networks and proposes algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet in dynamic random graphs, which can be seen as a control problem. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper characterizes the latency of routing in time-varying graphs and proposes algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet, which can be seen as an information theory problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
