The paper specifically focuses on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) framework, which is a common mathematical framework used in RL. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also discusses the real-time computation aspect of RL, which is related to Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper introduces a new algorithm, which falls under the category of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). Therefore, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.MA are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
