The approach involves finding the nearest correct query, which can be seen as a machine learning or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) problem. The paper also discusses a learning mode where query edits can be suggested as feedback to students, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper proposes a greedy heuristic approach, which can be seen as a machine learning or optimization problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
