The paper proposes a Bayesian nonparametric prior for embeddings that encourages sparsity and leverages natural groupings among objects. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
