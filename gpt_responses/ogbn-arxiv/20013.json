The paper proposes a simulated annealing local search algorithm to solve this problem, which involves defining an order for the vertices outside the FVS and gradually reducing the cardinality of the FVS under local vertex constraints. This algorithm involves techniques from artificial intelligence and optimization, which are subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
