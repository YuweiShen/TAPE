The use of parameterized complexity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of computational complexity (cs.CC) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the focus on perfect graphs may indicate relevance to computational geometry (cs.CG), as perfect graphs are often studied in this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
