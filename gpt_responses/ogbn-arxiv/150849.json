This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) since the approach is evaluated on downstream computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) in implementing the approach. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of neural networks (cs.NE) in training the intrinsic reward function."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
