The algorithm also incorporates gradient information, which is a common technique in optimization and falls under the category of \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). The use of Monte Carlo dropout and Sobolov training also suggests a connection to \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The algorithm is designed to handle large-scale optimization problems, which suggests a connection to \"cs.SY\" (Systems and Control) and \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
