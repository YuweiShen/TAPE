This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-category, which deals with the organization, retrieval, and distribution of digital information. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of semantic similarity to estimate research contribution, which is a common topic in Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the evaluation of research performance, which could fall under the sub-categories of Cybersecurity (cs.CY) and Cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
