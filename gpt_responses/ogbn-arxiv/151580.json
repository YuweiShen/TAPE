The paper specifically addresses visual-recognition tasks, indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV). The use of feedback alignment and weight mirror mechanisms suggests a focus on neural network training and optimization (cs.NE), while the comparison to backprop suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The mention of a neural circuit also suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
