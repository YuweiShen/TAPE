The approach involves using convolution neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for learning the joint representation of question-answer pairs and the answer sequence labeling task. This work involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the arXiv CS sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
