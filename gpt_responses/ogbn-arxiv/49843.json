This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a multi-task learning approach, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of edge detection as a complementary task also suggests relevance to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
