The soft-covering lemma, which is used in the analysis of the likelihood encoder, is a tool commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses multi-terminal source coding, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS) and side information at the decoder, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes alternative achievability proofs, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
