Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of random variables and probability distributions, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper mentions computational load and easy computation, which could potentially fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
