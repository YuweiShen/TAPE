Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also utilizes mathematical modeling and queueing theory, which suggests a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The analysis and comparison of different transmission strategies involve control and optimization, which could relate to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
