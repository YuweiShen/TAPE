The use of lookup tables is a novel approach to speeding up the inference process, which could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted on ModelNet and ShapeNet datasets involve geometric representations of objects, which could fall under the category of computational geometry (cs.GR). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as abstract and title analysis, which could also be relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
