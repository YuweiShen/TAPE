The paper also discusses the technical tools available for explainability, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering the audience and legal/regulatory framework, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybersecurity (cs.CY).
