This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on modeling user behavior on community-based question and answering websites, which involves analyzing social networks and information flow. This falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n- cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper proposes a model that captures the impact of badges on user participation, which is a social phenomenon. This falls under the scope of computational social science.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves analyzing user behavior on question and answering websites, which is related to information retrieval. This falls under the scope of information retrieval.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the impact of gamification elements on user participation, which is related to human-computer interaction.
