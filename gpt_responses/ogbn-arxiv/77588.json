The focus of the paper is on measuring fine-grained code coverage in black-box Android app testing, which is related to the sub-categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR), programming languages (cs.PL), and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of code coverage as a fitness function for guiding evolutionary and fuzzy testing techniques, which is related to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
