The authors propose a measure called Network Information Patrimony, which takes into account the quality of connections among nodes in a network. \n2. cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences) - The paper discusses the concentration of information related to individuals' preferences in the hands of a few gatekeepers and how platforms could exploit data stemming from connected profiles within a network to obtain competitive advantages. The authors also mention the potential ethical implications of such practices. \n3. cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy) - The paper touches upon the issue of data gathering and analytics, which has led to an unprecedented concentration of information related to individuals' preferences in the hands of a few gatekeepers. The authors also mention the potential ethical implications of such practices. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses how platforms could use data stemming from connected profiles within a network to obtain competitive advantages and implement steering practices by means of an increased ability to estimate individuals' preferences. The authors propose a measure called Network Information Patrimony, which considers the amount of information available within the system. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper heavily"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
