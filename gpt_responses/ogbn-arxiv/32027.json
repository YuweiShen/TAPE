The paper focuses on the cross-polytope LSH, which is a popular LSH scheme for angular distance. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely category, as it is the primary area for LSH research. The paper also discusses the use of Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, which is a well-known technique in information theory (cs.IT). The paper evaluates the proposed scheme on image retrieval tasks (cs.CV) and mentions its potential applications in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
