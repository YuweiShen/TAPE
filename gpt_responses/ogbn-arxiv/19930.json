The course is aimed at EE graduate students in the area of Communications and Information Theory, which further supports the likelihood of cs.IT. The course also covers topics such as Systems of Interacting Particles and Phase Transitions, which are related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The Random Energy Model (REM) and Random Channel Coding are also mentioned, which are related to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.PH (Physics and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
