This involves inferring the attributes of the current state and searching over paths through attribute space to get a high-level plan, and then using a low-level policy to execute the plan. This work involves machine learning, planning, and robotics, which are all covered by the arXiv categories of cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO, and cs.SY. Additionally, the paper includes experiments on 3D block stacking and grid-world games, which are related to computer vision and image processing, covered by the arXiv category of cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
