The paper also introduces statistical measures for capturing traffic characteristics, which could be considered as a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the impact of heterogeneous traffic on network performance, which could be categorized under system and information theory (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper uses statistical parameters to control the degree of heterogeneity, which could be considered as a topic in mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of traffic distribution on network performance, which could be categorized under performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
