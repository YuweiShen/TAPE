The paper discusses the use of selective rationalization, which is a technique used to ensure that predictive models reveal how they use available features. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given the focus on predictive models and the use of selective rationalization, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
