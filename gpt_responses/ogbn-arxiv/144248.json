This topic is closely related to computer engineering (cs.CE) and programming languages (cs.PL) as it involves creating new functions and extending the functionality of existing software. Additionally, the paper discusses improving the quality of computer applications, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE). The use of data tables to execute the same part of a worksheet several times also relates to databases (cs.DB) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
