The topic of DoF is primarily studied in the field of Information Theory (cs.IT), which makes it the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with communication systems (cs.COMM) and networked systems (cs.NI) as it studies the impact of delayed CSI on the performance of the broadcast channel. The paper also discusses the achievable DoF region, which involves signal processing techniques (cs.SI) and system control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
