Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the time complexity of the algorithm, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The paper also mentions the use of a greedy approach, which is a common technique in optimization problems, indicating that it could be categorized under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the approximate convex hull, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
