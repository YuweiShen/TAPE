The paper also includes a security analysis of the proposed scheme, which is a key aspect of cryptography and security research.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with data sharing in cloud computing, which is a key aspect of distributed computing. The proposed scheme is designed to handle data sharing within an organization, which is a distributed computing problem.\n3. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper deals with data storage and access in cloud computing, which is a key aspect of database research. The proposed scheme incorporates an access structure to handle data access privileges, which is a key aspect of database security.\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper deals with security and privacy concerns in cloud computing, which is a key aspect of the intersection between computers and society. The proposed scheme is designed to handle data sharing within an organization, which is a social and organizational problem.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a new data sharing scheme that incorporates an attribute-based encryption mechanism, which is a key aspect of software engineering research.
