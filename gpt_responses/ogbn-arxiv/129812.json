This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT) which deals with the processing and transmission of information. The paper also presents a novel framework for the analysis of the equivalence of mappings used for numerical representation of symbolic data, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) which deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The paper also relies on signal correlation to characterize equivalent mappings, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) which deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. The paper also introduces an abstract mapping model for symbolic sequences and extends the notion of equivalence to an algebraic framework, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) which deals with the study of networks and their properties. Finally, the paper illustrates its theoretical results by application to DNA sequence analysis, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC) which deals with the study of the inherent difficulty of computational problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
