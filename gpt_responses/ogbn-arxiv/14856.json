It also involves machine learning techniques such as clustering (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG). The application of the method is in medical imaging (cs.IR), specifically in the analysis of brain tumours. Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the method in representing underlying subregions (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
