This problem is typically studied in the context of graph algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.DM). The paper also presents algorithms for massively parallel computation (MPC), which falls under the category of parallel and distributed computing (cs.DC). The algorithms are designed to be efficient, accurate, and scalable, which are important considerations in computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
