The approach involves using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model each cell in an OctoMap, which is a 3D representation of the environment. This involves processing and fusing semantic features over time, which could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper involves encoding and decoding sequences of data, which could also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
