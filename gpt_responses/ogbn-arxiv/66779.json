It incorporates human pilot interactive decision making process using dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the use of reinforcement learning and modeling human pilot behavior. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) for the proposed game theoretical methodology. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) for the evaluation of UAS integration into the NAS. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) for the use of UAS equipped with sense and avoid algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) for the use of Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is a machine learning method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
