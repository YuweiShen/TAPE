This suggests a strong connection to information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): OFDM is widely used in wireless communication systems, and resource allocation is a critical issue in wireless networks. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The resource allocation problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, which is a common approach in systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): OFDM is often used in multimedia communication systems, and resource allocation is important for ensuring quality of service for multimedia applications. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The reduced primal-dual algorithm proposed in the paper is a type of optimization algorithm, which is a common tool in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
