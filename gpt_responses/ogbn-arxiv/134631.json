The proposed solution involves using a deep memory network to automatically expand short texts with relevant information from a collection of longer documents. This task falls under the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
