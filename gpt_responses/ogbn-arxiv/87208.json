The use of reduced order models and control Lyapunov function-based quadratic programs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The paper involves optimization of motion trajectories and ground reaction forces, which may require computer vision techniques for perception and sensing (cs.CV). The use of machine learning and optimization techniques for motion planning and control may also make the paper relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
