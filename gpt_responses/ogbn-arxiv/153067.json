The paper also discusses the optimization of parameter configurations, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of Rayleigh fading channels and the analysis of throughput efficiency can be related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a new scheme that has advantages over existing techniques, which can be considered as a contribution to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
