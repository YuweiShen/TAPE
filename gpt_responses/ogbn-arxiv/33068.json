This is a core topic in data structures and algorithms, and the paper's focus on computing functions and linear functions using a linear number of instructions is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper's focus on a procedural programming language and the constraints on updating variables one at a time align with the topics covered in this sub-category. Additionally, the paper's exploration of the exact number of instructions required to compute variable manipulations is relevant to programming language design and optimization.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper's analysis of the number of instructions required to compute functions and linear functions could be seen as a study of computational complexity. Additionally, the paper's exploration of the gains obtained by using additional memory could be relevant to the study of space complexity.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper's combinatorial framework for manipulating variables without using additional memory could be seen as a topic in discrete mathematics.
