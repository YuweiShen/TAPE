The paper also discusses the modification of network structure, which falls under cs.SI (Social and Information Retrieval). The algorithmic study of targeted network modifications suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
