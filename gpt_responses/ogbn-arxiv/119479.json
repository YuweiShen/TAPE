Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper also discusses the practical applications and stability of the normalization techniques, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
