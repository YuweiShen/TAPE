The paper's focus on the decidability of a sublogic of Strategy Logic suggests that it is more likely to be classified under cs.LO, but its relevance to multi-agent systems and game theory also make cs.AI and cs.GT likely categories. The mention of model-checking and satisfiability problems may also indicate a connection to computational complexity and algorithms, which could place the paper in cs.DS as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
