The focus on detecting memory errors and exploits suggests a potential fit for the categories of security and cryptography (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of low-fat pointers and type meta data may also align with the category of architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
