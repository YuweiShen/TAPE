The use of circularly-polarized ultrashort optical pulses to manipulate magnetization state falls under the category of electromagnetism (cs.EM) and micromagnetics (cs.MM). The optimization of synaptic weights using a global feedback mechanism involves mathematical optimization techniques, which are studied in the field of mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the implementation of supervised learning on an opto-magnetic neural network involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
