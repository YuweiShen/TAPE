The use of classes of symmetric boxes and the proposed algorithm for generating representatives of these classes suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The problem example from the chemical field and the cyclic n-roots problem indicate that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
