The paper also mentions the use of protection keys and binary inspection, which are topics related to computer architecture (cs.AR) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper emphasizes that the technique can be applied without requiring compiler changes and can run on a stock Linux kernel, which are topics related to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
