It defines complexity classes for computation on string functions and discusses NP- and PSPACE-completeness under suitable many-one reductions. This fits well within the scope of cs.CC.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the use of string functions as names representing uncountably many objects, which can be seen as a logical approach to handling these objects. It also defines complexity classes inspired by higher-type complexity theory, which has connections to logic. Therefore, cs.LO is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper considers the complexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real functions, which can be viewed as data structures. It also discusses the task of numerical algorithms for solving differential equations, which involves designing efficient algorithms. Therefore, cs.DS is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the complexity of numerical algorithms for solving differential equations, which is a topic in numerical analysis. It also considers the complexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real functions, which are objects of interest in numerical analysis.
