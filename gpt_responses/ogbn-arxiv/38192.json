Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a regularization method to enhance VQA models, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), hence cs.AI and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the lack of measurement in VQA, which relates to information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
