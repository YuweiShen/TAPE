The use of Lyapunov exponents to model the networks as random dynamical systems (RDS) suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. The focus on antenna configurations and amplification strategies suggests a signal processing (cs.SI) perspective. Finally, the use of multiple antennas at each relay falls under the category of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
