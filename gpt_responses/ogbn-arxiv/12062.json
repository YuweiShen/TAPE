This approach is inspired by distributed representations of words in the literature of natural language processing. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Deep Learning (cs.DL), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
