The paper also implements certain features of the TensorFlow Android Camera Demo application. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV). \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle, which falls under the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of deep learning neural networks also falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
