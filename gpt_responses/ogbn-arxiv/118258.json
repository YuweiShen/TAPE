The use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and channel estimation techniques also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes to optimize the transmit powers, which is a common approach in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
