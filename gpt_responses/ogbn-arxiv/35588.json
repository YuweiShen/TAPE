This involves drawing on the literature on normalizing flows to design models that are flexible and efficient. The paper also proposes a simple mixture model that matches the flexibility of flow-based models, but also permits sampling and computing moments in closed form. Given these characteristics, the paper is likely to be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), information theory (cs.IT), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
