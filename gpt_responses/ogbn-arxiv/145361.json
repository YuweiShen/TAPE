The paper also provides a set of open source tools for experimental validation and performance evaluation of SDN solutions. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the security aspects of SDN, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the coexistence of regular IP forwarding and SDN based forwarding, which makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the design and implementation of an SDN solution, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance evaluation of the proposed solutions, which makes cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
