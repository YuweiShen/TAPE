The use of mixture inequalities suggests a statistical approach, which is also relevant to data science (cs.DS). The proposed algorithm for computing the estimator involves computational complexity, which is a topic in computer science (cs.SI). Finally, the application of the estimator to hidden Markov models is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
