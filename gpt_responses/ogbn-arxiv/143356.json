The paper also addresses some specific issues related to digital pathological images, such as data imbalance and small sample size, which are common problems in information retrieval (cs.IR) and deep learning (cs.DL) research. Additionally, the paper proposes possible solutions to these issues, which may involve multimedia (cs.MM) techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
