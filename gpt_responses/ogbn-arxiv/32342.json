It also involves Boolean functions, which are a fundamental concept in computer science, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) likely categories as well. The paper also discusses the security of communication channels, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could potentially fall under cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
