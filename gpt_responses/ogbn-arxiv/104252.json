The paper also discusses the types of cuts permitted, which is related to the field of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The shapes of the polyhedra considered in the paper are also relevant to the field of computational geometry (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper discusses algorithms and computational complexity, which are topics in computer science theory (cs.DS, cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
