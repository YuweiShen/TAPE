The paper also extensively discusses the underlying theories and algorithms used in facial landmark detection, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of these algorithms on benchmark datasets, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
