The sparsity principle is also widely used in machine learning (cs.LG) for model selection. Signal processing (cs.IT) is another relevant field where sparse coding is used to represent data. The paper also mentions the application of sparse modeling in neuroscience and bioinformatics, which could fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and computational biology (cs.SD), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
