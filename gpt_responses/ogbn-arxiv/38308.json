Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with control tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a novel architecture for deep reinforcement learning, which could be of interest to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
