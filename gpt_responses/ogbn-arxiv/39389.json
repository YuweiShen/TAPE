This is a common problem in computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Cross-modal similarity search is also a problem in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents based on a query. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multiple modalities (images and text), which falls under the scope of multimedia research.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a joint learning approach for quantization, which involves training a model to learn the optimal quantizers for both modalities. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with text and image modalities, which falls under the scope of natural language processing and computational linguistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
