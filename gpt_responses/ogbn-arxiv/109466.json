The approach involves generating and refining invariants, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The use of k-induction is a formal verification technique, which is related to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and embedded systems (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
