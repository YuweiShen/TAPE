This involves learning from an initial example, monitoring the robot's position, and searching efficiently over high-dimensional policy-parameter spaces. The paper thus covers topics related to machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
