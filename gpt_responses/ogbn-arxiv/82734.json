The proposed approach involves clustering and matching 2D poses across views, which requires optimization and machine learning techniques, making it relevant to robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of appearance cues, which suggests the use of multimedia techniques (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
