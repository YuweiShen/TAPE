The network is also relevant to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, which is a technique for 5G networks, indicating a possible connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the effects of adding antennas to the receiver, which is a topic related to signal processing and communication (cs.SI). The use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the calculation of probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions, which is a topic related to game theory and economics (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
