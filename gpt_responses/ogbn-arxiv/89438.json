Specifically, cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are likely categories as they deal with the organization and retrieval of large amounts of data, including citations. cs.CY (Computers and Society) is also a possible category as the paper discusses the involvement of the scholarly community in crowdsourcing open citations. Additionally, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SD (Software Engineering) could be relevant as the paper proposes a new index for open citations and discusses the technical infrastructure for uploading citation data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
