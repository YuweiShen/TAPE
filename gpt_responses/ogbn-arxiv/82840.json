The weakness is related to the size of the key, which suggests information theory (cs.IT) as another likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a new operation on codes called folding, which involves manipulating the structure of codes, making it relevant to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper presents a unified view of existing constructions of alternant/Goppa codes with symmetries, which involves group theory and algebraic structures, making it relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the results, which suggests system and network security (cs.SI) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
