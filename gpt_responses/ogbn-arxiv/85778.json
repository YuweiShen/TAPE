This falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories. Additionally, the use of machine learning models for object recognition and evaluation of techniques for pedestrian safety falls under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the security and safety implications of autonomous vehicles, which falls under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
