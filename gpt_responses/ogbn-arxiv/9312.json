The use of dissimilarities and the focus on the selection of prototypes suggest a connection to the fields of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions large-margin principle learning, which is a concept often used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of numerical techniques and the focus on optimization suggest a connection to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
