This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of trellis coded modulation and space-time block codes, which are common techniques in wireless communication and signal processing, making sub-categories cs.SI and cs.MM likely as well. Finally, the paper also discusses the complexity of decoding, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
