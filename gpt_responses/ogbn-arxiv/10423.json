The models are designed to overcome the trade-off between representational power and computational efficiency in previous models. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on multi-label scene classification, which is a task in computer vision, cs.CV is more likely to be the primary sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
