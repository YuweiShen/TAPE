This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as well as robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach involves encoding past and future scene context, interaction context, and motion information, which involves machine learning techniques such as variational autoencoders (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing techniques for generating descriptions of the predicted trajectories (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
