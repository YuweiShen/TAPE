It also involves the use of information theory (cs.IT) to assess the randomness of the generated numbers. The practical considerations and limitations of using RAM for this purpose also relate to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of implementing this technique on resource-constrained devices, which falls under the category of optimization and control (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
