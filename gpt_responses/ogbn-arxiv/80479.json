Additionally, the paper mentions using PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research.\n\nThe paper also involves training a neural network end-to-end, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of refined ground truth and inaccurate polygon annotations suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.\n\nThe paper's focus on deep learning and neural networks may also suggest that it belongs to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.\n\nFinally, the paper's use of multiscale combinatorial grouping algorithm suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
