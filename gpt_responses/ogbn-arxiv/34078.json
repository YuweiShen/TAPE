The paper also discusses beamforming optimization, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and multiple-input multiple-output systems (cs.MM). The paper uses Lagrange duality, which is a technique commonly used in optimization and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
