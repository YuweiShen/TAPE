The proposed algorithm is specifically designed for linear camera arrays, which suggests a focus on multi-view geometry and camera calibration. The paper also mentions applications in virtual reality, immersive telepresence, autonomous driving, and video surveillance, which are all areas that fall under computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other possible sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.GR (Graphics), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
