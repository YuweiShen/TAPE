The proposed network is designed to improve the performance of conventional neural networks, which is also related to neural engineering (cs.NE) and signal processing (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed network to multispectral image denoising and singing voice separation, which are tasks related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
