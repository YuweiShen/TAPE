This suggests that the paper belongs to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The use of sparse graph representations and the design of KDS's for maintenance of these graphs suggest that the paper may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. The mention of algebraic functions and the use of slow-growing functions suggest that the paper may also belong to the symbolic computation (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the mention of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree suggests that the paper may also belong to the graph theory (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
