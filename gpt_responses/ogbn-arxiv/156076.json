Additionally, the paper discusses privacy concerns and proposes a solution using differential privacy, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. The paper also discusses edge computing and collaboration, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper proposes a new algorithm to improve the trade-off between model utility and privacy, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category.
