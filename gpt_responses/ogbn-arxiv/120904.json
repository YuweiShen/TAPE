This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY), which are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses deep neural networks for function approximation, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
