This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The approach also involves multi-task learning (cs.AI) and principal component analysis (cs.MM) to improve localisation accuracy and localise multiple landmarks. The use of a CNN for landmark localisation also involves regression and classification tasks, which are common in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
