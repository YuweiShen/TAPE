The paper focuses on leveraging explicit support in the form of query-answer memories and separating the responsibilities of searching for query-related support and predicting the answer. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval and evidence accumulation, which could also place it in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
