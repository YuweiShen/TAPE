The use of Siamese networks and thresholded loss also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The discussion of evaluating the robustness of trained features for patch matching suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the submission of results to evaluation portals suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
