The paper proposes an end-to-end approach for predicting predicates and argument spans, which involves making independent decisions about the relationships between every possible word-span pair. This approach involves learning contextualized span representations, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques such as neural networks (cs.AI, cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments and evaluation, which suggests the use of empirical methods (cs.NE). Finally, the paper may also involve computer vision techniques, as it deals with identifying and labeling spans of text (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
