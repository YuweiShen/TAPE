It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it generates sentential descriptions for the video. The use of discriminative training (DT) and maximum likelihood (ML) frameworks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of video as the primary data source suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
