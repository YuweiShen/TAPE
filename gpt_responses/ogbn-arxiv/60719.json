This falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of performance functions to design the control protocol, which suggests the use of optimization techniques and machine learning (cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SY and cs.RO, followed by cs.MA, cs.AI, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
