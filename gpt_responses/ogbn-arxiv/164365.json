The paper also introduces a new foveated clutter model, which involves the use of non-linear gain modulation, a concept that is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the new model in predicting target detection, which is a task that involves statistical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
