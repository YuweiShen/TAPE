The proposed algorithm involves multiple kernel metric learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of multiple geometric models for set representation and the application of Riemannian manifold-valued features are also related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the experiments involve emotion recognition and dynamic scene classification, which are tasks commonly associated with neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
