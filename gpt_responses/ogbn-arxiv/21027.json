The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for attribute detection, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the benchmarking of the dataset using multi-label metrics, which is a common practice in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the dataset for simulating unconstrained environments, which can be related to the subfield of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the under-representation of people of Indian ethnicity in existing datasets, which can be related to the subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
