The focus on human-in-the-loop computing and active learning suggests a strong emphasis on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The practical considerations section also suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the related areas section mentions information retrieval (cs.IR) as a field that could benefit from human-in-the-loop computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
