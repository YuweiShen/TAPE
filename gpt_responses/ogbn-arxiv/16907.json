Therefore, cs.DB is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions experiments with batch, streaming, and graph analytics workloads, which are common in distributed computing and data structures, making cs.DC and cs.DS likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses programmable monitoring and event abstraction, which are related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
