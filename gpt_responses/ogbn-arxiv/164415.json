The paper specifically addresses the issue of high variance in unbiased policy-gradient methods, which is a common problem in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses MuJoCo locomotive control tasks, which are related to control systems and robotics, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision, as it deals with locomotive control tasks, which may involve image processing, making cs.CV (Computer Vision) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
