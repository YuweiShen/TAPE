This involves encoding spatial information into the image representation and selectively focusing on different parts of the image. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the approach involves training using only word level annotations, which suggests a possible connection to Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of a language model to improve recognition results also suggests a possible connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
