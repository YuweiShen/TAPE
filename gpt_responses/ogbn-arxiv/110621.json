The paper focuses on the technical aspects of the communication framework, including the use of artificial Doppler shifts. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of Channel State Information (CSI) and Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) demodulator, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY), respectively. The paper also evaluates the proposed framework using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) BLE chips and 802.11-compliant testbeds, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
