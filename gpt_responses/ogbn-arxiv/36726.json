The system is based on observing users' pick-up movements, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The system is designed to be lightweight and efficient, which is related to computer systems and networking (cs.CY). The system also involves machine learning algorithms for quantifying similarities between users' pick-up movements, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
