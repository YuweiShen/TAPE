The proposed method uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user and news representations, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of attention-based LSTM models, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the incorporation of latent topics, which is a common technique in topic modeling (cs.SI). Finally, the paper is focused on personalized news recommendation, which is a subfield of recommender systems (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
