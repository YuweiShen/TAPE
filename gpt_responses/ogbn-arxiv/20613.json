The paper also discusses the use of neural networks (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) in the training process. Additionally, the paper involves game theory (cs.GT) in the creation of a self-play curriculum for the agents. Finally, the paper discusses the exploration of vast action spaces (cs.GR) in the training process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
