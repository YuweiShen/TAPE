Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the soundness proof of the extended calculus, which involves formal logic and proof theory, making cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) another likely category. The paper deals with type systems and type theory, which could fall under cs.TYPES (Type Theory). The paper also discusses the challenges encountered in designing the extended calculus, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper deals with the concept of mutation, which could fall under cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
