The system integrates recent advancements in visual-inertial state estimation and teleoperation to enable aggressive and safe autonomous flight around clutter. The paper also discusses the use of a locally consistent map that is incrementally constructed from forward-facing depth observations to ensure collision-free trajectories. Given the focus on robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
