This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Subspace clustering is a common problem in computer vision, where high-dimensional data is often encountered. Moreover, the paper validates its approach on gene expression datasets, which are often used in computer vision applications.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for subspace clustering with side-information, which involves estimating clustering accuracy based on partial side-information. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with clustering high-dimensional data, which is often encountered in social and information networks. Moreover, the paper proposes a new approach for subspace clustering with side-information, which can be useful in network analysis.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a new approach for subspace clustering with side-information, which involves learning an affinity matrix and spectral clustering.
