The use of status flags to represent divergence and abrupt termination is a logical approach that could also be relevant to Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper also presents a novel approach to representing these concepts, which could be of interest to Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) and Theoretical Computer Science (cs.THEORY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
