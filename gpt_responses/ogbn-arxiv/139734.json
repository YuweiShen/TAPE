It may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category as it discusses the reconfigurability of switches in the field, which is a security concern. Additionally, it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category as it discusses the need for switches to be protocol-independent and target-independent. It may also belong to the Architecture (cs.AR) category as it discusses the evolution of OpenFlow and proposes a new approach. Finally, it may belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category as it introduces a new high-level language for programming packet processors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
