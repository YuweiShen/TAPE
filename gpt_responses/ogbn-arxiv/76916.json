Information theory is closely related to the design of communication systems, and the use of hybrid processing is a promising technique to reduce the cost of massive MIMO systems. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a hybrid processing scheme for point-to-point massive MIMO systems, which is a key technology for future wireless networks. The use of matrix decomposition to design the hybrid precoders/combiners is a novel approach that can potentially improve the performance of such systems. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the design of communication systems, which is a key component of social and information networks. The use of hybrid processing is a promising technique to improve the efficiency and scalability of such networks. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of communication systems for multi-stream transmission, which is a key requirement for multimedia applications. The use of hybrid processing can potentially improve the quality of service and user experience for such applications. \n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hybrid processing scheme for massive MIMO systems, which can be viewed as a control problem.
