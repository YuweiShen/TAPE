The focus on feedback and its presentation modalities suggests a strong connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of technologies such as virtual and augmented reality in CBST suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR). The discussion of methods for feedback extraction and learning suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
