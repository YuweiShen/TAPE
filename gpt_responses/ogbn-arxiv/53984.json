This approach is commonly used in evolutionary algorithms and neural networks, which are subfields of cs.NE.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of a surrogate function and an acquisition function, which are common concepts in machine learning. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be used for hyperparameter tuning, which is a common problem in machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithm for global optimization, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The use of a surrogate function and an acquisition function is also a common approach in AI.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for global optimization, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms to iteratively search for the optimal solution.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm for global optimization, which can be used to optimize control systems.
