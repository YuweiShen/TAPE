The use of multimodal images is also a key aspect of the paper, which suggests a potential fit with the cs.MM sub-category. The paper also introduces auxiliary losses and a hard negative mining scheme to improve convergence and accuracy, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a key aspect of the cs.AI sub-category. Finally, the paper addresses the problem of image matching, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
