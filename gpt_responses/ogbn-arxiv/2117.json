The proposed method is evaluated on image classification tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the computational requirements of deep learning models, which could be relevant to \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Finally, the paper introduces a new method for tensor decomposition, which could be related to \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
