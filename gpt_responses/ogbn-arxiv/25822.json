The proposed descriptor aims to improve the discriminative ability of the descriptor under illumination changes, which is a common problem in image retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also proposes a robust contrast flipping estimate, which involves statistical analysis and optimization, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of local feature descriptors suggests a potential application in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
