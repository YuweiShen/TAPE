The use of empirically observed statistics and erasures is a novel approach to this problem, which suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or statistics (cs.ST) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions applications in climate change and virus mutation detection, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or systems and control (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses mathematical techniques such as large and moderate deviations, which suggests that it may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
