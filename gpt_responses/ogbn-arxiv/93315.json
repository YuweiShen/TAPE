The use of fixed-parameter algorithms and the study of the dependency on the number of constraints and the largest absolute value in the matrix suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of the Steinitz lemma and the consideration of the dual treedepth of the matrix suggest that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
