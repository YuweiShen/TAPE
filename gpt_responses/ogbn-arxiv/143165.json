The use of algebraic structures to study inference also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses message passing procedures, which are relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
