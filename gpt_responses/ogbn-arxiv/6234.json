The use of attention mechanisms also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning models and the DeepLesion dataset suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of end-to-end training suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
