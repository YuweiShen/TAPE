The use of LP duality and submodular minimization techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfields of optimization (cs.DS, cs.DC) and network economics (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions delay minimization, which is a common problem in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
