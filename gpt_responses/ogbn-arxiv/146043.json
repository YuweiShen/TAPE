It also uses a Deep Q-Network algorithm which is a popular algorithm in the field of AI. The cs.LG sub-category is also likely as it involves machine learning and improving the algorithm. The cs.CV sub-category is relevant as the agent learns from screen capture, which involves computer vision techniques. The cs.GT sub-category is relevant as the agent is capable of playing different games, which involves game theory. The cs.GR sub-category is relevant as it involves research in the video-games domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
