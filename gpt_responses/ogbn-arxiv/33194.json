The most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which is concerned with the fundamental limits of communication systems. The paper also involves concepts from cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), as it deals with interference management in a multi-user network. Additionally, the paper involves techniques from cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), as it deals with the optimization of degrees of freedom in a MIMO system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
