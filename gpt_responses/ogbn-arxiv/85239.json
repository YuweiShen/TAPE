The paper proposes a new perspective for understanding DNN generalization for such datasets, by investigating the dimensionality of the deep representation subspace of training samples. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This is the most likely category, as the paper deals with training accurate DNNs, which is a core topic in machine learning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions that their approach can effectively learn low-dimensional local subspaces that capture the data distribution, which is a common problem in computer vision. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new learning strategy that adapts the loss function based on the dimensionality of subspaces during training, which is a relevant topic in AI. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper does not explicitly mention language, but the proposed approach could potentially be applied to natural language processing tasks. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with training DNNs, which is a core topic in neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
