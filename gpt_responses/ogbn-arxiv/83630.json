Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also introduces a new framework inspired by distance labelling schemes and parameterized complexity, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of popular conjectures as a barrier for dynamic planar graph algorithms, which could be relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
