This makes it relevant to the machine learning community, specifically in the areas of deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of LNNs in physics, specifically in relation to conservation laws and symmetries, which makes it relevant to the systems and control community (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses LNNs to model physical systems, such as a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, which makes it relevant to the neural networks community (cs.NE) and computer vision community (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
