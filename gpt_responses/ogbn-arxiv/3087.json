This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates two recent deep reinforcement learning agents, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses robustness to self-modification and adversaries, which suggests that it may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories, respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the use of a hidden performance function to measure compliance with intended safe behavior, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
