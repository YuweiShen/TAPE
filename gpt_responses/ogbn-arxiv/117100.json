Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses policy conflicts and rule ordering, which are related to security and reliability, suggesting that cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also possible categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a framework for dynamic SFC composition and traffic steering, which involves resource allocation and optimization, indicating that cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of the proposed framework, which involves software engineering and testing, suggesting that cs.SE (Software Engineering) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
