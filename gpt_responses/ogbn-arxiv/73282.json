The proposed method is based on matrix completion, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and signal processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the issue of array uncertainties, which is related to signal processing and system identification (cs.SI). The proposed method is designed for switch-based hybrid structures, which are commonly used in wireless networks (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity channel estimator, which is related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
