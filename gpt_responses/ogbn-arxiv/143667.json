The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning and attention mechanisms, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve datasets with images and annotations, which are typical in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper uses intermediate supervision and feature fusion, which are techniques commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
