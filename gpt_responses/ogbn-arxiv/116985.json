It also involves error-correcting codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The flexibility of the parameters and the improvement of previous results suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC) and possibly to the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
