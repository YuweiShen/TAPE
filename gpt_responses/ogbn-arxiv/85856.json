This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV). The focus on MuJoCo environments also suggests a potential fit with the robotics and control sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
