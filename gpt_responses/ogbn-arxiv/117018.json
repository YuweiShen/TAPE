The use of deep learning methodologies and neural networks suggests that it could also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The proposed architectures involve customization of CapsNet, which is a popular deep learning model, indicating that it could also belong to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve benchmark datasets and image classification tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
