The paper also presents an implementation of client puzzles inside the TCP stack of the Linux kernel, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the game-theoretic approach to selecting puzzle difficulties, which can be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and multi-agent systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the implementation through experiments, which can be categorized under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
