The paper specifically focuses on improving the ability of these systems to distinguish distractor sentences, which is a common problem in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses mutual information to improve the performance of the system, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which could place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a regularizer to improve the robustness of the system, which could fall under the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
