The proposed method also involves learning with a combination of RGB-only and RGB-D datasets, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of a depth ranking learning objective and a constraint generator module suggests the involvement of robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
