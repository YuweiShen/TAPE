It also involves privacy and security, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of MDS codes and subspace alignment suggests a connection to coding theory and linear algebra (cs.DC). The problem of unresponsive and Byzantine servers is related to distributed computing (cs.DS). Finally, the application to distributed matrix multiplication suggests a connection to parallel and distributed computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
