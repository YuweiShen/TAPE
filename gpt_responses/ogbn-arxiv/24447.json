Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the design and training of neural network architectures, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of pre- and post-processing functions, which are common in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and signal processing (NE). The paper also discusses the use of pipelines and Docker containers, which are relevant to software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of command-line interfaces, which is relevant to multimedia (MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
