The problem of shape recovery after a certain number of particles have crashed involves distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed algorithms (cs.DS). The use of semi-synchronous adversarial scheduler suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
