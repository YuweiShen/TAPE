However, the paper also discusses the need for reporting practical significance, which could be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category. The use of statistical tests and effect size measures suggests a connection to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also discusses the use of nonparametric tests, which could be relevant to the programming languages (cs.PL) category. Lastly, the paper's focus on developing a statistical analysis workflow could be relevant to the computers and society (cs.CY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
