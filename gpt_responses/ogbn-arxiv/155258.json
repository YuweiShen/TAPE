It may also belong to the Databases (cs.DB) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories as it deals with caching input and intermediate data in memory. The Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper proposes a new policy for cache management. Finally, the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed policy in Spark."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
