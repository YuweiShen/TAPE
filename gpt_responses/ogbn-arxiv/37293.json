The use of stationarity property and ergodic theory also suggests a possible fit in the statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-category. The formulation of new bounds and series expansion involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of numerical methods and simulations to validate the results could also be relevant to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the application of the results to a bit-patterned media recording channel model suggests a possible fit in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
