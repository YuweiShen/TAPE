The use of springs and compliance in the model suggests a focus on robotic systems and mechanical engineering (cs.RO, cs.ME). The analysis of robust regrasping conditions suggests a focus on control systems and robotics (cs.SY). The use of simulation and experimentation suggests a focus on computer vision and robotics (cs.CV). Finally, the overall topic of robotic manipulation and control suggests a focus on robotics (cs.ROB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
