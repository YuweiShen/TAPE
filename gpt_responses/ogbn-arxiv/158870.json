This falls under the scope of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and natural language processing (cs.LG). The proposed method of transcription using transducers and electronic dictionaries involves machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of rules and algorithms for transcription also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
