This involves the allocation of resources among multiple D2D pairs and between mmWave and cellular carrier bands. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also uses game theory to formulate the resource allocation problem and proposes a coalition formation game to maximize the system sum rate. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper considers the characteristics of cellular and mmWave communications, indicating that it may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a scheme to improve system capacity, which involves the coordination of multiple devices, suggesting that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
