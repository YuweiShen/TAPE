This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of semi-supervised learning, which is a topic commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the recognizer to video sequences suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of different face parts in the recognition task, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
