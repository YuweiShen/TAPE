Additionally, the paper mentions the use of object detectors, which are a key component of many computer vision systems. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. \n\nThe use of an ensemble of detectors to improve performance suggests that the paper could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category, as robotics often involves the integration of multiple sensors and detectors. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with video analytics, which suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category, as video is a common form of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
