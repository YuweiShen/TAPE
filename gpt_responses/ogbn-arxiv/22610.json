The focus on chordless graphs suggests that the paper may fall under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or combinatorial geometry (cs.CG). The use of algorithms and polynomial time complexity also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), graph theory (cs.GT), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
