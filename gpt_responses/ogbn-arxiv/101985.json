This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper proposes a smartphone-based application for melanoma detection, which involves user interaction with the application. This falls under the domain of human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper involves the use of a database (PH2 Dermoscopy image database) for development and testing purposes. This falls under the domain of information retrieval. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper involves the use of images for melanoma detection, which falls under the domain of multimedia. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper proposes a real-time alert to help users prevent skin burn caused by sunlight, which involves security and privacy concerns.
