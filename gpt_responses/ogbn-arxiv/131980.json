Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves succinct data structures, which are space-efficient representations of data, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions improving LCA-computation in BPS- or DFUDS-encoded trees, which falls under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper involves theoretical analysis and asymptotic optimality, which is relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
