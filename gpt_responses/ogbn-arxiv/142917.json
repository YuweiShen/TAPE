The proposed solution involves collecting and categorizing fashion keywords, collecting a new fashion product dataset, and training a deep learning model to predict and explain high-level fashion concepts in a product image with its low-level and domain-specific fashion features. This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for analyzing product images, natural language processing (NLP) techniques for categorizing fashion keywords, and machine learning (ML) techniques for training the deep learning model. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.CL for NLP techniques, cs.LG for ML techniques, cs.IR for information retrieval techniques, and cs.MM for multimedia analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
