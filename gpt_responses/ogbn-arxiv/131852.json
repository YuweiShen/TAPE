The paper also discusses heuristics for efficient ordering and execution of operations, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents experimental results comparing the proposed algorithms to previous ones, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
