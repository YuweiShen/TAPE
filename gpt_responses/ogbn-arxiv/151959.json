The prover also supports cooperation with external reasoning systems, which is a common feature in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper mentions the use of the TPTP/TSTP framework, which is a standard format for automated theorem proving and falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper mentions support for different deontic logics, which is a subfield of philosophy and ethics and may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) due to its potential applications in ethical decision-making systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
