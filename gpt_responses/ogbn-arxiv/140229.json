The method is applied to videos, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel layer-dependable temporal group normalization method, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of 3D convolutional networks, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on the action recognition task, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
