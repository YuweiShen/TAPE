The concept of abstention, where algorithms are allowed to refrain from making predictions, is a key focus of the paper. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the adaptation of existing algorithms to the problem of abstention, which involves the manipulation of data structures and the analysis of regret guarantees. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
