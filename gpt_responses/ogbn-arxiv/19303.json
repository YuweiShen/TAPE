This is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The use of skip connections and channelwise concatenations is a common technique in deep learning (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The evaluation of the proposed architecture on object recognition and semantic segmentation datasets suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and image processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
