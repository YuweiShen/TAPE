The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques for perception, specifically using RGB images to extract affordances, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of deep learning for training the neural network also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the system's performance on a physical robot arm suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
