The paper also proposes a new method for detecting when small input perturbations cause classifier errors, which falls under the subfield of computer security (cs.CR). The paper's focus on AI classifiers and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks suggests that it could also be categorized under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experimental results presented in the paper involve a voice recognition system, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper draws on information theory to explain the behavior of AI classifiers, which suggests that it could also be categorized under the subfield of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
