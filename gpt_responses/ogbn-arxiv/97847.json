The paper also discusses the use of quantization and hardware acceleration, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel computation pattern for efficient computing, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
