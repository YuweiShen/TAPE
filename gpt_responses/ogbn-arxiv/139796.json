The paper also proposes a new boosting algorithm that optimizes a cost function, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experimental results involve face detection, which is a specific application of computer vision (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions convex optimization, which is a common topic in computer science theory (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
