This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the Hanani-Tutte theorem, which is a well-known result in graph theory, and uses concepts from discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The algorithmic aspect of the paper suggests that it could also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
