This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and privacy (cs.CR). The use of optimization techniques and the consideration of the Cramer-Rao bound suggest a focus on theoretical aspects, which could place the paper in the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or databases (cs.DB). Finally, the use of inverse Fisher information matrix and the demonstration of the methodology on multiple datasets suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
