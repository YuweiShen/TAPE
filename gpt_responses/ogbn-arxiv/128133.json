The paper proposes a new model for face recognition that uses a validation classifier to normalize the decision threshold, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of traditional face verification methods and proposes a new approach, which involves training a validation classifier, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve processing large datasets of images, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of its findings for real-world scenarios, which could fall under the category of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
