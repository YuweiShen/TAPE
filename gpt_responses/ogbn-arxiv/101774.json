The application of the proposed method to brain imaging and graph pattern analysis suggests that it also falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and scientific computing (cs.NA). Finally, the use of spectral decomposition and orthogonal polynomials in the proposed method indicates that it may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
