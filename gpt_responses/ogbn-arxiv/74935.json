The paper also mentions the use of other sorting algorithms like Heapsort, Insertionsort, and Mergesort, which falls under the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. The paper also provides transfer theorems and examines the possibility of sorting base cases with some other algorithm, which falls under the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category.
