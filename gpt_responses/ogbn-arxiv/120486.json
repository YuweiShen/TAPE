These topics are all related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI). The use of caching and MIMO for video streaming also falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the joint optimization problem can be seen as a control problem, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
