This problem involves signal processing, communication theory, and optimization, which are all covered by the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a sequential convex approximation method to solve the mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper presents numerical results to compare the proposed method with traditional beamforming solutions, which involves machine learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
