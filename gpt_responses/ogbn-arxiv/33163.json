The paper also discusses practical capacity-achieving schemes and joint source-channel problems, which fall under the signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper introduces a new approach called \"network modulation,\" which could potentially be of interest to researchers studying MIMO systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
