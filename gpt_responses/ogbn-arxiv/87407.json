This topic falls under the field of information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SOC). The paper also mentions scalability and perturbation theory, which are relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and statistical learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the bias towards popular nodes in network-based algorithms, which is a topic in social dynamics (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
