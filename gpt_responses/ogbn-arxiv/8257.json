It could also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) since the task involves retrieving similar texts. Additionally, the use of distributed representations of words suggests that it could belong to Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the task of detecting plagiarism could also fall under the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
