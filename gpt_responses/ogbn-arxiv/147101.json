The paper also discusses the implementation of these protocols using C programming language, which falls under the Networked and Internet-based Computing (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper introduces a formal syntax for constructs used in these protocols, which is related to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also discusses the need for non-ambiguous specifications, which is related to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper introduces a C library for implementing these protocols, which falls under the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
