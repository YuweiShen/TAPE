The use of sparse signal models and signal similarity also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the Kolmogorov entropy of the signal model, which is a concept in information theory and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
