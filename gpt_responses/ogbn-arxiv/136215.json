Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category. The paper also proposes a new training strategy that involves maximizing semantic similarity scores, which involves the use of machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of pre-trained language models, which could also place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category. Finally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of abstractive summarization models could also place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
