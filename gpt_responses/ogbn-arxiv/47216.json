The proposed framework involves balancing the training process, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of IoU-balanced sampling and balanced L1 loss also suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as word embeddings, which could relate to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
