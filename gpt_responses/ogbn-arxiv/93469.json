Therefore, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves matrix multiplication and approximation algorithms, which are topics in theoretical computer science, so cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) are also likely sub-categories.
