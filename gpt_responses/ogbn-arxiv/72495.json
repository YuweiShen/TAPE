These techniques are commonly used in computer vision and machine learning, indicating that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of ontology-based patterns suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of deep learning techniques such as CNNs and LSTMs further supports the possibility of the paper belonging to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of post-event segments to predict success/failure suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
