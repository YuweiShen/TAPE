It also focuses on improving the interpretability of the learned policies, which is a common goal in the field of machine learning. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the development of intelligent agents that can learn to play Atari games. \n\nThe paper also involves computer vision techniques for visualizing the learned policies, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). \n\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a mechanism for incorporating visualisation ability into the learning model, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics) as it involves the development of intelligent agents that can interact with their environment. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of reinforcement learning techniques, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with the development of control systems for intelligent agents."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
