Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves computational complexity analysis, which falls under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of algorithms and data structures for outlier detection may also place the paper under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the expressive capabilities of default logics, which could be relevant to cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
