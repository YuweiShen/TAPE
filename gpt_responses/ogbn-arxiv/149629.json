The paper proposes a new method for finding good subnetworks in large deep neural networks, and provides theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of this method. The paper also presents empirical results on several popular neural architectures used in computer vision, such as ResNet, MobilenetV2/V3, and ProxylessNet. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
