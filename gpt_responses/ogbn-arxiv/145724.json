The paper also proposes a new pooling configuration and an extended Adaboost for bit selection, which involves machine learning techniques such as rankSVM and sparse support vector machines, indicating a possible fit for machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed descriptor on publicly available benchmarks, which suggests a possible fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
