The paper also proposes a neural subtask graph solver (NSGS) to solve this problem. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because the paper proposes a new RL problem and a neural network-based solution. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) because the paper proposes a new learning problem and a neural network-based solution. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) because the paper proposes a new RL problem that can be applied to robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) because the paper proposes a new RL problem that involves control and decision-making. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) because the paper presents experimental results on two 2D visual domains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
