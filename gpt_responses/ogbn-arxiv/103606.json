It also involves the use of unsupervised mining of spelling variants from social media, which falls under the sub-category of Social and Information Retrieval (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper involves manual analysis, which could fall under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of spelling variants also involves Information Retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with evaluating ASR systems, which could fall under the sub-category of Cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
