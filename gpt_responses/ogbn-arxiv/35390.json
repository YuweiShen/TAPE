The problem is known to be NP-hard, which suggests that it may also be relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also presents recognition algorithms for specific graph classes, which falls under the category of graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
