This involves encoding entities and relations in a knowledge graph into a low-dimensional space, and using a generator to obtain high-quality negative samples for training. This work is related to several sub-fields in computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), databases (cs.DB), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
