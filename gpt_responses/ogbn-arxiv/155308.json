The proposed method is applied to 1D convolutional neural networks for audio classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the weight sampling approach and induced WSNet promote parameter sharing, which is also relevant to information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
