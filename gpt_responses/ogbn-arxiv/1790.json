The method is applied to time-optimal control problems for linear mechanical systems, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also compares the performance of the proposed method to a recent action-value method, which is a common approach in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
