It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as deep neural networks are a popular machine learning technique used in AI applications. The neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category is also a possibility as it deals with the design and implementation of neural networks. Finally, the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category is a possibility as the paper discusses strategies for efficient memory management, which is a common challenge in distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
