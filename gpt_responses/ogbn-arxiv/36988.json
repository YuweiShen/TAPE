The paper specifically focuses on the lack of explainability and interpretability of AI models, which suggests a focus on explainable AI (cs.AI). The infusion of domain knowledge also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of IoT devices suggests a focus on sensor networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
