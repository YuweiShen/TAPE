The paper also discusses the use of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) in the edge-cloud interplay, which could be classified under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) or systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the potential use of deep learning in healthcare, agriculture, finance, energy, and transportation, which could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the privacy implications of using crowd-sourced data, which could be classified under cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
