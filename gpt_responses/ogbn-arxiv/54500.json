Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a new technique for dealing with metric equalities, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper uses dynamic programming, which is a common technique in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
