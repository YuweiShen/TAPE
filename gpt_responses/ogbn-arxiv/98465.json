This involves robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques such as reinforcement learning and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed architecture, which involves learning and optimization (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper presents a synergy between reactive control and reinforcement learning, which involves control systems (cs.SY) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
