The paper also mentions the Yap system, which is a Prolog system, further supporting the connection to programming languages. Therefore, cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. The paper also deals with optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses the advantages and weaknesses of different tabling strategies, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
