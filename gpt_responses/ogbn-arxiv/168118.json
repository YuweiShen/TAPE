The paper also discusses the design of large-scale distributed networks, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of augmented local links and the analysis of routing algorithms involve aspects of network information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the results in social networks (cs.SI) and peer-to-peer systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
