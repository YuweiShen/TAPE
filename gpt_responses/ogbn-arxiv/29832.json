The paper also addresses safety and liveness properties, which are important in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of blockchain technology and protocols for implementing cross-chain deals suggests that the paper could also be classified under the Databases (cs.DB) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the synchronization of concurrent access to data, which is a topic in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. However, given the focus on adversarial settings and blockchain technology, the other sub-categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
