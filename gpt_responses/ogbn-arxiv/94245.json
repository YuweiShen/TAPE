Given that the paper focuses on the design of codes with optimal repair bandwidth, it is most likely to be classified under cs.IT and cs.DS. However, it also presents low-complexity encoding, decoding, and repair procedures, which could make it relevant to cs.DC. Finally, the paper discusses the error resilience capability of the constructed codes, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.SI and cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
