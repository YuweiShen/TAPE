The paper discusses the importance of predictive uncertainty and its calibration for accurate planning and exploration. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses the \\textsc{HalfCheetah} MuJoCo task, which is a computer vision task, so cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper deals with control and decision-making, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
