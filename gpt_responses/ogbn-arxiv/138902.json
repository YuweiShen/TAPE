The use of stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of users suggests that the paper may also fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The analysis of the statistical distributions of interferences experienced by a typical uplink is related to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as it deals with the handling of multiuser interference. Finally, the use of MRC and ZF receivers suggests that the paper may also fall under the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category, as it deals with the design and analysis of communication protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
