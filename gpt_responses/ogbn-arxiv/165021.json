The use of decomposition methods and the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is a common technique in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses numerical results and comparisons with other decoding methods, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of LP decoding and projection onto the parity polytope involves linear programming (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
