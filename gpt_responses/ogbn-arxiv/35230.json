Therefore, it is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves experimentation with language pairs, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
