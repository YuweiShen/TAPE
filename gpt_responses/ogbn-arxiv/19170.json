This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as corpus-based methods and iterative workflows. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for selecting and validating the expanded set, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely sub-category.
