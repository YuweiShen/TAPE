The use of a decision theoretic setting and multi-stage stochastic game also suggests that it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the problem of lifelong learning in uncertain environments, which could also place it in the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
