The authors develop an automated way to detect stable fixations and segment an object of interest around the subject's fixation in the visual frame. They also use a deep convolutional neural network to obtain a high-level feature representation of the object. Therefore, this paper is likely to belong to the computer vision sub-category. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the interaction between humans and prosthetic devices. The authors aim to improve the control of upper limb prostheses by incorporating visual cues. Therefore, this paper is also likely to belong to the human-computer interaction sub-category. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with the control of robotic prosthetic devices. The authors aim to improve the control of upper limb prostheses by incorporating visual cues. Therefore, this paper is also likely to belong to the robotics sub-category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a deep convolutional neural network to obtain a high-level feature representation of the object. Therefore, this paper is also likely to belong to the machine learning sub-category. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses surface electromyography to control the prost"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
