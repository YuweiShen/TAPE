The paper also proposes novel scheduling schemes, which can be considered as a system-level optimization problem (cs.SY). The analysis of the proposed schemes involves statistical analysis of fading channels, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses fairness among users, which is a topic related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
