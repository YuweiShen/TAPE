This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a deep neural network-based framework for authentication, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The proposed method utilizes the inherent process variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters, which involves signal processing (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.IT, cs.NE, and cs.SY, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
