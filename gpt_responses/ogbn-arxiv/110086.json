The algorithms presented in the paper rely on sparsity of the matrix and use local and asynchronous updates, which are topics in distributed computing (cs.DS) and parallel computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses convergence guarantees and error bounds, which are topics in control theory (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
