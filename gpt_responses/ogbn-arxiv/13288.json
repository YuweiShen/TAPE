Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes low-complexity myopic sensing-transmission policies for optimizing the trade-off between performance and cost, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques, making cs.MA (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed policies in terms of their performance and complexity, which involves statistical analysis and experimental evaluation, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
