This involves information-theoretic concepts such as channel capacity and rate maximization. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a practical scenario of wireless power transfer, which is a key aspect of wireless networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes the use of multiple energy harvesting circuits in parallel to address the nonlinearity issue due to saturation. This involves system design and control aspects. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the performance enhancement of SWIPT with nonlinear energy harvesting using multiple circuits, which can have implications for multimedia applications that require both data and power transfer. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves optimization of a nonconvex problem, which requires computational techniques and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
