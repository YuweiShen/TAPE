The paper also introduces a new measure called \"expressivity\" to quantify how much a feature vector informs us about an attribute, which involves training a second neural network, and this technique falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper studies the changes in the encoding of facial attributes over training iterations, which is related to neural network optimization (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
