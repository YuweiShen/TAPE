Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm for pose estimation indicates that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper involves fiducials, which are commonly used in graphics and augmented reality, suggesting that it could belong to cs.GR (Computer Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
