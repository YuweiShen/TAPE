The paper also discusses the limitations of measuring time-of-flight on Wi-Fi and other RF consumer technologies, which relates to information theory (cs.IT). The development of algorithms and implementation of a system also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of signal maps, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
