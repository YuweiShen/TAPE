The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) also suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper's focus on improving the efficiency of active learning methods also suggests that it may fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE).
