The use of a probabilistic model and the focus on relevance to user queries suggest that the paper may also fall under information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the use of shot selection and importance in the context of the video suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on search engines and snippets suggests that it may also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
