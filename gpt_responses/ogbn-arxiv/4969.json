The algorithm involves a novel linear space representation of the position automaton that supports state-set transition computation in near-linear time. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a new algorithm for regular expression matching that improves the best known bounds for the problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the data structures and algorithms community. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper presents a new algorithm for regular expression matching that takes advantage of sparsity in the input instance. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the computational complexity community, which studies the inherent difficulty of computational problems. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper involves a novel linear space representation of the position automaton that supports state-set transition computation in near-linear time. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the discrete mathematics community, which studies mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper involves regular expression matching, which is a central topic in formal languages and automata theory. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the formal languages and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
