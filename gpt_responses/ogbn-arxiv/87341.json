This falls under the umbrella of reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. The paper also mentions the use of general value functions, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
