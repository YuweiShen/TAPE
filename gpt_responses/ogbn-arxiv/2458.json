The paper also proposes a new approach for representing input features and obtaining activations of hidden neurons, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of hardware FPGA implementations suggests a focus on embedded systems (cs.ET), and the use of encoding techniques and hyperdimensional computing suggests a focus on computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
