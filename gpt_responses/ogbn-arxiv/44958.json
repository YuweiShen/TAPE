Additionally, the paper evaluates the robustness of machine learning-based modulation classifiers against adversarial attacks, which is a growing area of research in the field of information security (cs.CR). The paper also uses machine learning techniques to classify modulated signals (cs.LG, cs.AI), and the results of the study could have implications for the design of cognitive self-driving networks (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
