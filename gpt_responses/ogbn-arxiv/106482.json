Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks, which are common applications of deep RL. Finally, the paper also discusses the problem of system changes at test time, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
