This topic is closely related to computer security (cs.CR) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of oblivious RAM (ORAM), which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents lower bounds for various classic data structures, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
