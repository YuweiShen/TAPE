This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a novel loss function to improve the learning of the regression network layer suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The application of the proposed method in driver attention monitoring suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of depth data and the real-time capabilities of the framework suggest that the paper may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
