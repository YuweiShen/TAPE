The paper introduces a new class of drawings called single-pair-seq-shellable drawings and proves the Harary-Hill Conjecture for this class. This involves developing new techniques for analyzing the number of crossings in a drawing, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also uses results on triple cumulated k-edges and k-deviations, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
