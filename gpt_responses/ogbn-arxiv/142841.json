The use of MapReduce framework to solve scalability issues is also relevant to large-scale data processing (cs.DB). The implementation of the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) with variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a machine learning approach, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
