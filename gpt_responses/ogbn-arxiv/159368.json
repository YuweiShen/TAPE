The proposed approach involves integrating pose information into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of surveillance and video datasets, which are typically used in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper involves developing a novel reordering of the MARS dataset, which involves data management and organization, a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
