The paper proposes a model and training method to learn the arbitration function, which is a key challenge in shared autonomy systems. The model is based on a recurrent neural network and takes as input the state, intent prediction scores, and user command to produce an arbitration between user and robot commands. The paper also discusses the differentiability of the policy and proposes training of the arbitration function using data from the user performing the task with shared control. Based on these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on teleoperation of pick-and-place tasks using shared autonomy, which is a key area of research in robotics. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a model and training method to learn the arbitration function, which involves machine learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the shared autonomy framework, which involves interaction between the user and the robot. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a model and training method to learn the arbitration function, which involves machine learning techniques. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the shared autonomy framework, which involves control of the robot by both the user and the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
