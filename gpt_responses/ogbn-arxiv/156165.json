This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the optimization of energy and bandwidth allocation in a network with multiple transmitters and receivers. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm to optimize the energy and bandwidth allocation in a network with energy-harvesting transmitters. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the allocation of bandwidth to multiple receivers in a network with multiple broadcast channels. This falls under the domain of multimedia.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithm to solve the energy and bandwidth allocation subproblems.
