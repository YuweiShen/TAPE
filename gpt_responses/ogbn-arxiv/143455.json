The approach proposed in the paper involves learning performance models based on a sample set of configurations, which involves machine learning techniques such as transfer learning (cs.LG) and potentially artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) since it requires configuring, compiling and executing the entire system against a complex test suite. Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of complex systems (cs.SY), which is a relevant sub-category given the focus on finding optimal configurations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
