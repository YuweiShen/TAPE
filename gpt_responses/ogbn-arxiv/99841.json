This involves filtering and resource allocation problems, which are typical topics in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses lattice quantization and entropy coding, which are common techniques in multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory. The paper's focus on the asymptotic regime and the use of infinite-dimensional Gauss-Markov sources suggests a connection to statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
