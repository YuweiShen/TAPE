The paper focuses on exploring directly in parameter space, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the robustness of the method, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the use of the method in computer vision, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
