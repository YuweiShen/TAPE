This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The codes studied in the paper are abelian and have a cubic structure, which suggests that it may also belong to the coding theory (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also mentions applications of the codes to secret sharing schemes, which falls under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The study of the defining set of the codes involves algebraic structures, which suggests that it may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses Gauss sums, which are a tool from number theory, indicating that it may also belong to the group theory (cs.GT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
