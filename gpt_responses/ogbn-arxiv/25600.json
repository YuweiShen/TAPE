Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also deals with multimedia streaming, which suggests the category cs.MM (Multimedia). The QoS-aware scheduling component and the cost-efficient VM Provisioner component involve network infrastructure and optimization, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity and Cryptography). Finally, the dynamic reconfiguration of the VM cluster involves system-level control and optimization, which could be classified under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
