The paper also discusses the use of weighted mean-square-error minimization (WMMSE) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization (cs.MM). The paper also involves the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) and microwave frequencies, which are relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the reduction of system hardware cost and power consumption, which is related to the field of computer systems and architecture (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques for hybrid transceiver design, which is related to the field of computational optimization (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
