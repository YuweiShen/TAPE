The empirical evaluation is done on the task of face recognition from sets of rasterized appearance images, which is a typical computer vision problem. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a discriminative learning scheme, which falls under the category of supervised learning, and hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also deals with statistical techniques and inference, which are typical topics in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The empirical evaluation involves image processing and analysis, which falls under the category of multimedia, and hence, cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of uncertainty associated with noise and sampling randomness, which is a typical topic in information theory, and hence, cs.IT (Information Theory) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
