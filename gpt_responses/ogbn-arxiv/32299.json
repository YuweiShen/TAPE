Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new operator for TIR object tracking, which involves optimization and regularization techniques, indicating that it could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two TIR tracking benchmarks, which could suggest it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
