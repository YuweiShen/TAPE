The paper uses techniques from property testing, which is a subfield of computer science concerned with designing algorithms that can test whether an object satisfies a certain property with a small number of queries. The paper also uses tools from information theory and probability theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
