This involves leveraging user physiological and kinematic response data to predict task difficulty, which suggests a focus on human-robot interaction (cs.HC) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper specifically applies this approach to teleoperated robotic needle steering, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
