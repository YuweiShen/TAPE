The proposed model uses distributed computing and big data technologies such as Apache Spark and Hive, which are commonly used in data processing and analysis (cs.DC). The model is designed to retrieve information about faculties and their research works, which involves information retrieval techniques (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of Tableau for visualization, which is a tool commonly used in cyber security and data analytics (cs.CYBER).
