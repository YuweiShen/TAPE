The paper focuses on improving the performance of RVFL networks by introducing direct connections between layers and denoising criteria in the autoencoders. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
