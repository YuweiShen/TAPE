The focus is on obtaining prior knowledge on the usual modality and affordance estimates of entities, which are important concepts in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV). The paper also discusses possible feature and learning framework adoption, which are relevant topics in machine learning (ML) and information retrieval (IR).
