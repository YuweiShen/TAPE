This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The proposed modification involves changes to the key negotiation process, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of the proposed modification on users' privacy, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
