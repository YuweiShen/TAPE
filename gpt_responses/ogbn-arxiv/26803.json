The proposed method is based on the saddle point approximation technique, which is commonly used in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of the normal-inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution as a base distribution, which is a topic related to statistical inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper applies the proposed method to evaluate the SINR outage probability in scenarios with random number and locations of interferers, which involves the use of stochastic processes and random variables (cs.MA). Finally, the paper presents numerical results to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method, which is a topic related to game theory and decision making (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
