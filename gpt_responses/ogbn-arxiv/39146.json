This involves careful consideration of memory layout and placement to exploit spatial locality and conserve memory bandwidth. The paper also discusses memory safety models. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages) as the paper proposes a new language feature. Other likely sub-categories include cs.SE (Software Engineering) as the paper discusses software design considerations, cs.AR (Architecture) as the paper discusses hardware and software architecture considerations, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as the paper discusses memory optimization for high-performance computing, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the paper discusses memory safety models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
