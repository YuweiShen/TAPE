This work involves computer architecture (cs.AR) and system-level design and implementation (cs.DC), as well as system-level optimization and performance evaluation (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the trade-offs involved in arranging data within ECC DRAM, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
