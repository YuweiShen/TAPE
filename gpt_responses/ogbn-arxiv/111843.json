The paper also introduces a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, which is commonly used in optimization and decision-making problems, falling under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on thousands of tasks, which involves data analysis and experimentation, falling under the category of data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
