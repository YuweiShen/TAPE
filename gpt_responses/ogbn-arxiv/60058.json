This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes efficient algorithms for finding optimal committees under various voting rules, which is a problem that arises in many real-world applications of AI, such as group decision making and recommendation systems. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes algorithms for finding optimal committees under various voting rules, which can be seen as a form of learning from data (i.e., preferences of voters). \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with combinatorial optimization problems, which is a topic that falls under the scope of discrete mathematics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
