This work is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the focus is on deep neural networks and their interpretability, we believe that cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
