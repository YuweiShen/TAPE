This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). However, given the focus on hardware implementation and optimization, cs.AR is the most likely category. The use of DCT interpolation filters and the discussion of tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity also suggest a focus on signal processing and optimization, further supporting the likelihood of cs.AR and cs.SY as relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
