This is a common problem in machine learning and falls under the category of ensemble learning. The paper proposes a new approach to combining classifiers using information granules. Information granules are a concept from fuzzy logic and are used to represent uncertainty in data. This approach is related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), neural networks (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
