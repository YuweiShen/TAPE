The limited/bandit feedback setting is also a common scenario in online learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves designing algorithms and analyzing their performance, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper deals with coordination between different entities (the forecaster and the experts), which is a topic in control theory and systems engineering, falling under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
