The paper proposes a method to enhance neural natural language inference models with external knowledge. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the use of external knowledge, which could fall under sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as external knowledge could be retrieved from various sources such as knowledge graphs or search engines."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
