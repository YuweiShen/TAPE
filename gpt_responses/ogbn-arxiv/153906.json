This falls under the domain of electromagnetic effects on electronics in space.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper proposes a multi-stage approach for fault-tolerant computing in space, which involves a combination of software and hardware techniques. This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the challenges of implementing fault-tolerant software for on-board computers in space and proposes a novel approach. This falls under the domain of software engineering.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed approach for fault-tolerant computing in space, which involves multiple processors working together. This falls under the domain of distributed computing.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses the challenges of implementing fault-tolerant embedded systems for on-board computers in space and proposes a novel approach.
