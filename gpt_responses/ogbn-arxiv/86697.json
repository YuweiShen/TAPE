The paper also discusses the issue of bias in classification models, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a modified gradient update step for the gradient descent-ascent algorithm, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper tests its approach on datasets and compares against state of the art algorithms, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
