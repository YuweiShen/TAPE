It also involves the use of quadratic functions, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The concept of transitivity is often studied in the context of group theory, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions an upper bound on the number of codes, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization (cs.NA). Finally, the use of propelinear codes is a topic in coding theory and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
