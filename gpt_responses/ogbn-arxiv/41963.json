The paper also discusses pose composition and inversion, which are important in computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed framework involves modeling jointly distributed poses, which is a machine learning problem (cs.LG). The paper also deals with correlation between poses, which is a control systems problem (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for uncertainty estimation, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
