This involves path planning and robotics, which falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO). The use of FCNs for representing the cost model underlying expert driving behaviour suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a deep, parametric approach for scaling efficiently to large datasets and complex behaviours, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the robustness of the approach to systematic errors suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
