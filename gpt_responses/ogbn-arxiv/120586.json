Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses information theory concepts such as path-loss and channel switching, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as another likely category. The use of millimeter-wave bands for communication is a key aspect of the paper, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the limitations of millimeter-wave communication, which could place it in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
