The paper also evaluates the performance of different CNN feature extractors, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with medical imaging, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses an ensemble method for further performance improvement, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
