The use of advanced search queries at PatentsView suggests a focus on web search and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also involves classification of patents into specific categories (cs.CY) and analysis of longitudinal distribution of publication years (cs.CR). Finally, the use of Patent Citation Spectroscopy (PCS) suggests a focus on data analysis and visualization (cs.DL) and potentially social network analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
