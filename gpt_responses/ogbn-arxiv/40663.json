The scheme is designed to simplify the adaptation of learning algorithms to growing amounts of data and growing needs for accurate and confident predictions, which involves dealing with large-scale data and computation, and thus relates to distributed computing (cs.DC). The scheme is applicable to a broad class of learning algorithms without further mathematical derivations and without writing dedicated code, which involves algorithmic design and optimization, and thus relates to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The scheme is able to reduce the runtime of many learning algorithms to polylogarithmic time on quasi-polynomially many processing units, which involves complexity analysis and theoretical computer science, and thus relates to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
