The paper also discusses the optimization of the coding gain through constellation stretching, which is related to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The proposed codes are compared to existing codes in the literature, which involves Computational Complexity (cs.CC) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
