Therefore, cs.AI and cs.NE are the most likely categories as they are directly related to AI and machine learning. The paper also deals with the control of traffic signals, which falls under the category of control systems, making cs.SY a likely category. The use of wireless technology and communication networks in ITS suggests that cs.IT could also be a relevant category. Finally, the paper uses RL to optimize the performance of the system, which is a form of optimization, making cs.LG a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
