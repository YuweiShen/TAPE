The concept of a degree of confidence in a belief also relates to probability and uncertainty, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper's focus on surprise and the unexpected could be relevant to the field of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
