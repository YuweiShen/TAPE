The approach involves transforming the problem into an equivalent POMDP with deterministic transitions, which could also fall under robotics (cs.RO) or control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses theoretical results and sample complexity bounds, which could be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
