It also employs novel ideas that may be applicable in other communication problems, which could fall under categories such as coding theory (cs.CC), signal processing (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
