This is a common problem in the field of machine learning and signal processing, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also uses data sets from various sensor network projects, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper proposes an algorithm for solving a convex program, which involves optimization techniques, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with the practical challenges of deploying sensing systems, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper proposes a method for handling anomaly readings, which involves techniques from outlier detection and anomaly detection, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
