It extends the use of notebooks to embedded systems specified by pCharts and describes the underlying software architecture. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also discusses the issue of proper placement of transition labels in charts embedded in notebooks, which suggests a connection to cs.EM (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper mentions the spirit of literate programming, which is related to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of notebooks for presentations and inspection of the design suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and the use of notebooks for qualitative and quantitative analysis suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
