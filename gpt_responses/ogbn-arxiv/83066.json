The paper also utilizes natural language descriptions as additional training supervisions, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category. The paper proposes a method for learning better visual features, which involves building global and local image-language associations, indicating that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper also involves experiments and evaluation of the proposed method, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper involves the use of implicit correspondences between image regions and noun phrases, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
