The paper proposes a novel technique called \"Latent Replay\" for continual learning, which involves storing activations volumes at some intermediate layer instead of storing past data in the input space. This technique is evaluated on complex video benchmarks such as CORe50 NICv2 and OpenLORIS. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
