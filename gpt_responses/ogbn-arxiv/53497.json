The algorithm also solves the word problem for the free skew field and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, which are problems in data structures (cs.DS) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions applications in quantum information theory (cs.QA) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
