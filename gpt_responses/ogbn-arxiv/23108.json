This involves optimizing the use of available subchannels and clusters, which is a key aspect of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a practical scenario of user clusters undergoing serious angular-spreading-range overlapping, which is a common issue in wireless networks. The proposed scheme aims to improve the performance of the system by reducing overhead, which is a key concern in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a graph-based approach to mitigate angular-spreading-range overlapping among user clusters. This involves analyzing the potential overlapping relationships among clusters and optimizing the use of subchannels, which is a key aspect of social and information networks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a heuristic approach to optimize the use of available subchannels and clusters in a massive MIMO system. This involves developing an edge-weighted vertex-coloring based pattern division scheme, which is a type of optimization problem that can be solved using machine learning techniques. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a practical scenario of user clusters undergoing serious angular-spreading-range overlapping, which can affect the quality of"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
