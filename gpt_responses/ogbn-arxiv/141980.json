The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for machine translation, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) tasks.
