Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the use of channel models and protocols, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper evaluates the feasibility of using these technologies for automotive applications, which could fall under cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) or cs.CE (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
