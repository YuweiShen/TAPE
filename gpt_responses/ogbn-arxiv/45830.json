The study involves engineering vehicle trajectories to subvert social expectations and analyze the resulting non-verbal communication cues. This work involves aspects of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and graphics (cs.GR) to create the virtual environment. Computer vision (cs.CV) is used to track the movements of the subjects in the virtual world. Robotics (cs.RO) is relevant as the study involves the interaction between humans and autonomous vehicles. Finally, social and information sciences (cs.SI) are relevant as the study investigates social signaling and perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
