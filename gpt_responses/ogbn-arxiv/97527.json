The concept of stationary ergodic predictor is related to the theory of dynamical systems (cs.DS) and stochastic processes (cs.SI). The negative result presented in the paper may have implications for the design and analysis of algorithms for data compression (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
