Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their performance limits, which is the focus of this paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with media streaming in MIMO interference networks, which is a networking problem. The proposed scheme involves multiple base stations (BS) delivering media to their associated users, which is a typical networking scenario. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with media streaming, which is a multimedia application. The proposed scheme aims to improve the performance of media streaming by mitigating interference. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a cache control mechanism that is adaptive to the long-term popularity of media files. This is related to the study of social networks and their dynamics. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a joint stochastic optimization problem that involves both precoding and cache control. This requires the development of efficient algorithms and data structures to solve the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
