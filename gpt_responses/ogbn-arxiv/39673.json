The method also involves solving rigid body motion, which falls under robotics (RO) and artificial intelligence (AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with geometric features, which is related to computational geometry (GR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.RO, cs.AI, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
