This falls under the category of reinforcement learning and decision making, which is typically classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of similarity between arms, which is related to clustering and graph theory, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of reward function homophily, which is related to social networks and game theory, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
