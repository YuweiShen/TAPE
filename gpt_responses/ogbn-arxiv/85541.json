Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves benchmarking and comparing different algorithms, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of surrogate models could be related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
