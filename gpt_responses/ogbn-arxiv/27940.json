This problem is closely related to information theory and communication systems, which are covered by the cs.IT and cs.COMM sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of spatial division multiplexing and the impact of inter-user interference, which are relevant to the cs.NI sub-category. The proposed multi-mode transmission strategy involves adapting to channel statistics information, which is a system-level approach and falls under the cs.SY sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with multiuser MIMO, which is a topic covered by the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
