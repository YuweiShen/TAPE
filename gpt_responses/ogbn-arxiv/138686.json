This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image processing and geometric reasoning (GR) for 3D reconstruction. The proposed method uses machine learning (LG) to learn high-level structural graph layouts and low-level 3D shapes. The method also involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for generating 3D models from images. Finally, the method can be applied to robotics (RO) for bridge inspection and maintenance. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
