This system is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it aims to annotate images. Additionally, it involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it captures brain signals via a consumer EEG device. The use of unsupervised outlier removal suggests a potential application of neural networks (cs.NE) in the system. The paper also mentions the success of deep learning in computer vision, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
