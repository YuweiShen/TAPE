The problem being studied involves content-type distribution networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. The problem involves side information sets, which suggests that it could belong to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) category. The paper also uses combinatorial design techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category.
