This involves learning a policy mapping the lander's estimated state directly to a commanded thrust for each engine. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of proximal policy optimization, a policy gradient method, to learn the policy suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents simulation results demonstrating the guidance and control system's performance, indicating that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
