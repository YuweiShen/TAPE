The use of LMCs is common in probabilistic verification, speech recognition, and computational biology, which suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of cs.IT, cs.DS, and cs.LG. The algorithmic aspects of the paper, including the polynomial-time algorithm and the NP-hardness result, suggest that it could also belong to the sub-categories of cs.DM and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
