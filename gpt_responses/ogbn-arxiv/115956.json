The problem involves selecting a group of items adaptively so as to maximize the expected utility. This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
