This involves both algebraic and combinatorial techniques, requiring profound structural knowledge in design theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), followed by cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves complexity analysis, which suggests the possibility of it being categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
