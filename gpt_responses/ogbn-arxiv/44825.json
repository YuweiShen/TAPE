The paper proposes a formalization of sequential decomposition and studies decomposition problems in three different settings, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-categories of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Software Engineering (cs.SE), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
