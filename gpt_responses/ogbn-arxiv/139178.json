The paper also discusses the trade-off between external cost and communication capacity, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The optimization problem presented in the paper involves minimizing the rate of information required for the controller's operation, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the reduction of the controller's order, which is a topic in digital circuits and systems (cs.DC). Finally, the paper deals with the design of memoryless controllers, which is a topic in control theory and robotics (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
