However, based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), as the paper proposes a new beam design technique that reduces search time and guarantees a minimum beamforming gain without requiring CSI. This involves using Bayesian learning for measurements clustering, which is a technique commonly used in information theory. \n\nThe second likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), as the paper deals with improving the efficiency of mmWave communication, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n\nThe third likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper proposes a new technique for beamforming that involves configuring phase-shifters, which is a control problem. \n\nThe fourth likely sub-category is cs.MM (Multimedia), as mmWave communication is often used for multimedia applications such as video streaming and virtual reality. \n\nThe fifth likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper uses Bayesian learning for measurements clustering, which is a technique commonly used in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
