The paper also discusses the problem of domain shift, which is a common issue in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed technique is also applicable to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
