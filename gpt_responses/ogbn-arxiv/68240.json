This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the improvement of deep networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed method involves distinguishing data sets that different models are good at, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
