This problem has implications for database systems (cs.DB) as well as algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The proposed approximation algorithms and cost-model-based index involve computational intelligence (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.CE). Finally, the problem of spatial crowdsourcing and worker movement can also be seen as a form of social computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
