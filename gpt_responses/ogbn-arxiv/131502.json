The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques to recover latent vectors from noisy images, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the bias correction of the recovered latent vectors, which can be considered as a geometric problem (cs.GR). Finally, the paper involves the comparison of the proposed method with existing signal processing-based methods, which can be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
