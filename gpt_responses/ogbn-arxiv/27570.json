This involves the use of high sensitive imaging techniques, which are mainly used for quality control in photovoltaic plants. The paper proposes a method that is computationally efficient and able to detect modules under perspective distortion and in scenarios where multiple modules are visible in the image. Given the focus on image processing and computer vision techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other possible sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as these areas also involve image processing and machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
