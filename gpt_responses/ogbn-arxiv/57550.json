This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the application of the method is in medical imaging (cs.Medical Imaging) and the use of the novel activation function is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
