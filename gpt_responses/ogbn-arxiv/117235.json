The focus is on maximizing the mutual information between the visible data and the hidden representation, which is a common goal in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the capacity role in a neural network, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
