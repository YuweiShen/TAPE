This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the study of natural language processing and computational linguistics, which involves the use of symbolic and neural methods to represent and process language. The paper's focus on learning semantic representations of expressions could be seen as a natural language processing task, and the use of neural networks is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents and their behavior, which involves the use of symbolic and neural methods to reason and learn. The paper's focus on combining symbolic and neural reasoning is relevant to this sub-category, as is the task of learning continuous semantic representations. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that can learn from data, which includes both symbolic and neural methods. The paper's use of neural networks to learn semantic representations is relevant to this sub-category, as is the task of checking equivalence on a diverse set of expression types. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the study of neural networks and their applications, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
