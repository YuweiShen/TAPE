The algorithm is designed to work efficiently even for general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which significantly broadens the applicability of Bayesian online algorithms for SPNs. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
