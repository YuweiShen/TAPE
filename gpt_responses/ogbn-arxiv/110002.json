This falls under the broad category of digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of spectral clustering and feature selection algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning and data mining, suggesting a possible connection to social network analysis (cs.SI) and data science (cs.SD). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the approach to a specific scientific domain (astronomy), which could be classified under cyberinfrastructure (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
