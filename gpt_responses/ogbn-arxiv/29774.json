The proposed method involves mining knowledge from radiology reports to define a set of labels for the lesions, which is a natural language processing task falling under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The use of a multi-label convolutional neural network for image classification suggests the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing techniques for text mining, which falls under the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The use of a noise-robust loss function and the evaluation metrics used (area under ROC curve) suggest the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
