The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The problem is modelled as a stochastic game, which is a subfield of game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the control policies of the service providers, which is a subfield of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes an online scheme to approach the optimal control policies, which is a subfield of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
