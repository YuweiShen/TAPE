The paper also deals with the challenges of complex environments, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of deep learning methods such as CNNs also suggests a possible subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR). The evaluation of the methods on a large dataset also suggests a possible subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of machine learning methods for face detection suggests a possible subfield of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
