This involves modeling the entities as individual processes in Hoare's CSP model, which is a formal language for describing communicating sequential processes. The paper also mentions applications to domains such as IoT and robotics, which suggests a focus on cyber-physical systems. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) for the use of temporal logic, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the coordination problem, cs.SE (Software Engineering) for the focus on reactive programs, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) for the modeling of multiple entities, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) for the applications to cyber-physical systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
