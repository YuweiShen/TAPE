It also involves learning feature embeddings, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves recognizing duplicates based on feature vectors, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which could suggest that it belongs to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category.
