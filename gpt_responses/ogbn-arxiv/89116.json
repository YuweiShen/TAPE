The paper also discusses the increase in power of these automata compared to classical counterparts, which relates to \"Computational Complexity\" (cs.CC) and \"Data Structures\" (cs.DS). The fact that some problems are shown to be solvable by these enhanced automata also suggests a connection to \"Logic in Computer Science\" (cs.LO) and \"Programming Languages\" (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
