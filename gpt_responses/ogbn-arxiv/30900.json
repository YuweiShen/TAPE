The focus is on systems with many agents, which suggests the subcategory of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses convergence guarantees and scalability, which are topics in optimization and control theory (cs.SY). The learning protocol proposed in the paper is model-free and decentralised, which suggests the subcategory of reinforcement learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions applications from economics, which suggests the subcategory of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
