Specifically, it proposes unsupervised and semi-supervised methods based on sequence models such as Hidden Markov Models. This falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the use of manually specified features, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed methods empirically, which falls under the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
