The paper also discusses the potential benefits of high model interpretability in human-computer communications (cs.HC) and debugging network representations (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks in learning from few annotations (cs.NE), which further supports the inclusion of this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
