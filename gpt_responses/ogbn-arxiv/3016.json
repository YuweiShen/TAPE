The study of complexity of reasoning over ontologies is a topic in logic and computational complexity (cs.LO). The use of ontologies for data integration is also a topic in databases (cs.DB) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with fragments of OWL, which is a language for representing ontologies and falls under programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
