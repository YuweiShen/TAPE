The proposed system is evaluated on different benchmarking data sets, containing either feature-based or structured patterns. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
