The paper also discusses the use of submodular maximization in various applications such as influence maximization, data summarization, and recommendations, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG), data mining (cs.DM), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes algorithms for submodular maximization with multi knapsack constraints, which involves optimization over multiple constraints and can be considered as a problem in optimization and decision making (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
