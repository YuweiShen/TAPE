The paper proposes a method for constructing analytic models using symbolic regression (SR) to improve the RL control. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the application of the method to input-output models of the NARX type, which suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as well. Finally, the comparison with deep neural networks and local linear regression suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
