Additionally, the use of deep learning and convolutional neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of multiple 1X1 convolutional and ReLU layers further supports this. Finally, the use of encoded low level distance maps suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
