It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it proposes a new scheme for feature extraction that improves the discriminative power of CNN activations. Additionally, it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) categories as it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for image classification and instance-level retrieval tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
