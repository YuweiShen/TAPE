Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the problem of whole-body control, which falls under the scope of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The proposed approach involves hierarchical control, which can be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper mentions maintaining end-effector configuration in operation space, which can be related to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
