The paper also introduces a new loss function for validation of landmark estimation, which involves training the network to estimate the accuracy of its own landmark estimation, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments conducted on facial landmark data, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
