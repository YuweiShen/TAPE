This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also addresses external interference from multiple sources, which is a common issue in wireless communication systems, and hence, it could also be classified under the signal processing (cs.SI) category. The paper also extends the studies to massive MIMO framework, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper proposes an optimal augmented linear RX, which could be classified under the communication (cs.COM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
