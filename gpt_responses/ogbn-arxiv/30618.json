The use of graph classes with bounded expansion suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Graph Theory (cs.GT). Finally, the study of parameterized complexity and kernelization is a common theme in Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
