The use of recurrent connectivity in artificial neural networks is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). The comparison of different network architectures and their performance evaluation involves machine learning techniques, which can be categorized under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also introduces two novel datasets for stereoscopic occluded object recognition, which can be considered as a contribution to natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves the creation and analysis of textual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
