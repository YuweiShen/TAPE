Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a new method for transforming monolingual embeddings to make orthogonal alignment easier, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on word translation accuracy, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
