The paper also proposes a curriculum learning approach, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach involves dividing the task into sub-tasks, which is a common strategy in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also uses visual inputs to the robot, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
