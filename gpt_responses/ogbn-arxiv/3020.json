The paper also provides a new guarantee for the error introduced by sketch-and-solve. The techniques and results presented in the paper are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), information theory (cs.IT), data structures (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, given that the paper focuses on a machine learning problem and proposes a new technique for solving it, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.NA and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
