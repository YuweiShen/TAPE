This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed models are based on deep neural networks, indicating that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the use of a video game (Super Mario) as the source of the dataset suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
