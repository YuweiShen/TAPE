The paper also discusses the use of background knowledge and the interpretability of the measure, which suggests that it could also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of noisy tiles and maximum entropy modeling also suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
