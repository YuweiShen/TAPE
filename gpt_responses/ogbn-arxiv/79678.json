The use of signal constellation topology and its impact on non-vanishing determinants suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The mention of decoding complexity and fast decoding techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of analytical optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of signal constellation topology suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
