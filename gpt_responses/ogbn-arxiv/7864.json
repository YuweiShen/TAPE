This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), programming languages (cs.PL), computational complexity (cs.CC), and data structures (cs.DS). The paper's focus on the formalism of CoL and its extensions suggests that it is most likely to be classified under cs.LO, but its relevance to other sub-categories cannot be ruled out."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
