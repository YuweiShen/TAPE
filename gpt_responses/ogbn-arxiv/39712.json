The proposed low-complexity algorithms are based on the special properties of the effective channel matrix, which can be considered as a signal processing problem and thus related to the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. Finally, the optimization of the equalization algorithms can also be seen as a machine learning problem, which is relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
