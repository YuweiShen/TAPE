RTI is a technique that uses radio waves to track object location without requiring the objects to transmit or receive radio signals. This makes it relevant to the sub-category of computer networks and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper proposes improvements to the imaging and automatic target recognition aspects of RTI, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of RTI for surveillance, which is relevant to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
