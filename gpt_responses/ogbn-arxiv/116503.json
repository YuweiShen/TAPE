The use of SAT solvers also falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and circuit complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the translation of non-boolean clause-sets to boolean clause-sets, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
