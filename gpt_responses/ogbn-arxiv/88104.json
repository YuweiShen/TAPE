It involves the analysis of the attacking mechanism of CAPTCHA and proposes a new design principle based on private information to distinguish human Typer from human user. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also involves the design of a web interaction and password handling program, which suggests the possibility of belonging to the sub-categories cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe proposed CAPTCHA design also involves the use of a novel generation algorithm with a fuzzy matching method, which suggests the possibility of belonging to the sub-categories cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
