The use of synthetic data and simulation is also a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the practical application of the proposed method in large-scale industrial settings suggests a potential fit with systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
