The use of hierarchical structures is also a common approach in these fields, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper specifically focuses on image and text datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also deals with classification performance, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper proposes data-driven approaches for hierarchical structure modification, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
