The paper also explores the tradeoffs between security and performance in signal modulation techniques enabling ToA measurements, which relates to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper proposes basic principles for protecting ToA measurement systems against attacks, which is relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
