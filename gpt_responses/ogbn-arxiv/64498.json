The use of MPI and OpenMP for parallelisation suggests that the paper may also belong to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The use of a flow solver and analysis of power consumption suggests that the paper may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The focus on optimisation and efficiency suggests that the paper may also belong to the performance (cs.MS) sub-category. Finally, the mention of aeroelasticity and fixed structures suggests that the paper may also belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
