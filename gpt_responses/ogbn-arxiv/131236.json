The proposed method is based on optimization, specifically sum-of-absolute-values (SOAV) optimization, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the optimization (cs.Optimization) category. The paper also mentions the use of an algorithm, which could indicate that it belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG) or numerical analysis (cs.NA) categories.
