The paper proposes a novel variable transformation for decoupled consensus control design, which is a significant contribution to the field of cooperative control and multi-agent systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY, followed by cs.MA, cs.RO, cs.AI, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
