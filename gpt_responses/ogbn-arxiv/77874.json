The focus on natural game dynamics and the effects of timing suggest that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-categories. The use of polynomial and exponential bounds suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
