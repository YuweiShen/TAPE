The use of randomly coded masks is a technique commonly used in compressive sensing (cs.IT) and the paper explicitly mentions the use of sparse recovery algorithms such as basis pursuit. The paper also discusses the effect of blurring and subsampling on the required number of masks, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
