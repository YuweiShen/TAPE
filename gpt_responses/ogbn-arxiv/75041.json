This involves machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques for predicting user behavior based on ad content and attributes. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) for processing ad content and computer vision (cs.CV) for processing ad images. Finally, the use of meta-learning (cs.AI) to improve the learning process for generating embeddings further supports the inclusion of this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
