The paper also discusses the computation of contact-stability constraints, which is a common problem in robotics. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
