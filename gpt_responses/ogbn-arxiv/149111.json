The paper also discusses the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, which are common issues in training neural networks, and proposes solutions to address them. Therefore, the paper could also be categorized under Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions using RNNs for tasks such as image and natural language processing, which are areas of research in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
