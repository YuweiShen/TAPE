The paper also discusses the limitations of context-based word embeddings and proposes a new model that integrates intrinsic and extrinsic information, which involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks and optimization algorithms. Therefore, the paper is also relevant to subfields such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
