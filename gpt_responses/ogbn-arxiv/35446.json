The use of non-negative, sparse decomposition is also a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of deep and shallow neural networks, which are common in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on two image datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
