The paper also mentions simulation work, which suggests that it may fall under the cs.MA (multi-agent systems) category. Additionally, the paper discusses modifications to the routing protocols, which could fall under the cs.DC (distributed, parallel, and cluster computing) or cs.IT (information theory) categories.
