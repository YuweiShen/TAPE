The proposed system leverages pre-existing knowledge of the environment and matches macro-features from UAV captured images with an offline pre-existing vector from a CAD model. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as it deals with the development of autonomous UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments. Additionally, the paper heavily relies on computer vision techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of machine learning techniques further supports this possibility. The paper also involves the use of traditional computer vision techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper's focus on the development of a real-time system suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on UAV navigation suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
