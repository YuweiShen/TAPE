This suggests that the paper involves numerical methods for solving computational problems, which falls under the scope of cs.NA. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper focuses on uncertainty quantification in electronic and photonic ICs, which are emerging technologies. This suggests that the paper may fall under the scope of cs.ET. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new method for handling non-Gaussian correlations in uncertainty quantification, which involves developing a class of smooth basis functions. This suggests that the paper may involve the development of new algorithms and data structures, which falls under the scope of cs.DS. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves uncertainty quantification in electronic and photonic ICs, which are complex systems that require control. This suggests that the paper may fall under the scope of cs.SY. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new method for uncertainty quantification that involves developing a scalable tensor method to compute basis functions and a sparse solver with adaptive sample selections.
