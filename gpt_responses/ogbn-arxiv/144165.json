The use of deep learning models for these tasks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing techniques for data curation, which could place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category.
