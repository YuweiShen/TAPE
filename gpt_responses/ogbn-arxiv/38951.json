This involves natural language processing, machine learning, and database technologies, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.DB, cs.IR, and cs.LG. Specifically, cs.AI deals with intelligent systems that can reason and make decisions, which is relevant to the inference method used in this paper. cs.CL deals with natural language processing, which is used to extract evidence from text. cs.DB deals with database technologies, which are used to store and query the knowledge graph. cs.IR deals with information retrieval, which is relevant to the search for evidence. cs.LG deals with machine learning, which is used in the inference method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
