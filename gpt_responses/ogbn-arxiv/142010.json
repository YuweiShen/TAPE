The paper focuses on improving the accuracy and robustness of CNNs for medical image segmentation, which is a common problem in computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also proposes image-specific fine tuning and a weighted loss function, which are related to deep learning techniques such as transfer learning and uncertainty estimation. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper applies the proposed framework to two specific medical image segmentation tasks: 2-D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal magnetic resonance (MR) slices and 3-D segmentation of brain tumor core and whole brain tumor from different MR sequences. Therefore, the paper may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which are sub-categories related to multimedia analysis and medical imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
