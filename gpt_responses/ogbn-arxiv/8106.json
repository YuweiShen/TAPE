The authors discuss the potential sources of IoT forensics and present a forensically sound investigation methodology. This suggests that the paper is related to the security and privacy aspects of cloud computing and IoT.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): BitTorrent Sync is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud storage service, which involves distributed computing. The paper investigates the data remnants from the use of BitTorrent Sync on different devices and presents a methodology for forensic investigation. This suggests that the paper is related to distributed computing and P2P systems.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the forensic investigation of cloud storage services, which is a topic related to the social and ethical implications of technology. The authors highlight the importance of forensic practitioners having a contemporary understanding of cloud artefacts to ensure effective collection of IoT-based evidence.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a forensically sound investigation methodology for BitTorrent Sync, which involves software engineering principles and practices. The authors discuss the challenges and limitations of forensic investigation in the context of cloud computing and IoT.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper investigates the data remnants from the use of BitTorrent Sync, which involves file synchronisation"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
