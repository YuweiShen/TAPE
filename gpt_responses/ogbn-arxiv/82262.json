However, this category is less likely as the paper does not focus on natural language processing specifically. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not deal with visual data, convolutional neural networks are commonly used in computer vision, hence this category cannot be completely ruled out."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
