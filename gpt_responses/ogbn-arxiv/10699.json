Additionally, the use of neural sequence-to-sequence models is a common approach in this sub-category. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as machine translation and software internationalization are important applications of AI. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses the use of neural networks for the transliteration task. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is a possibility as transliteration is important for search engines to retrieve relevant results in different languages. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possibility as the paper focuses on the use of neural networks for the transliteration task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
