It introduces a novel transformational equivalence result that can turn the problem of query answering under differential privacy with a modified notion of neighbors to one of query answering under standard differential privacy. This result is applied to the Blowfish privacy framework that generalizes differential privacy, and error efficient algorithms are developed for releasing histograms and multidimensional range queries under different Blowfish policies. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the categories of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Databases (cs.DB), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Theory (cs.IT), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
