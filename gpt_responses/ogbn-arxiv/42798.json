This is a core area of computer vision research and hence, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): Camera relocalisation is an important problem in robotics, especially for tasks such as robot navigation and mapping. The paper discusses the application of CNN-based relocalisation to map compression, which is relevant to robotics. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses CNNs for camera relocalisation and proposes a smaller CNN architecture for map compression. This falls under the domain of machine learning and hence, cs.LG is a likely sub-category. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of CNNs for camera relocalisation and map compression can be seen as an application of artificial intelligence. Hence, cs.AI is a possible sub-category. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): While not the most likely sub-category, cs.GR is a possibility as the paper deals with camera relocalisation, which is relevant to computer graphics applications such as augmented reality and virtual reality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
