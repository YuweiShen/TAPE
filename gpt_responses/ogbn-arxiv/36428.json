The use of automata and regular expressions to represent regular languages suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures (cs.DS). The study of state complexity is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC), and the paper provides upper bounds on the state complexities of various pattern-matching languages. The use of regular languages to model patterns and texts suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper provides bounds on the state complexities of pattern-matching languages, which may be relevant to the sub-category of computational geometry (cs.CG) where similar bounds are often studied."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
