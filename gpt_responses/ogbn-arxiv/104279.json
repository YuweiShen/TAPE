The paper proposes an algorithm that uses trajectory profiles and graph-search to generate feasible trajectories for different maneuvers, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of heuristic optimization algorithms and quadratic cost functions, which are common in control systems and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents simulation and driving-test experiments to validate the proposed algorithm, which involves machine learning techniques and statistical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
