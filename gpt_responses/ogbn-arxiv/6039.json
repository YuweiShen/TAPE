The use of adaptive control and iterative learning control also suggests that the paper could be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions transfer learning, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experimental results involve quadrotors, which are often used in computer vision applications (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
