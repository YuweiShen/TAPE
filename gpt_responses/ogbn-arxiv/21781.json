The use of deep learning (DL) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The incorporation of a bilateral solver layer suggests that it could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of both synthetic and real images for training suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
