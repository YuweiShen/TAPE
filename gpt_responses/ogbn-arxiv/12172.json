The paper proposes a deep learning approach to detect phone scams and deceptive advertising, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is a popular technique in image recognition and computer vision (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting these threats, which falls under the category of system and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
