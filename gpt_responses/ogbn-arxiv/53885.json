This falls under the domain of robotics, specifically aerial robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses vision-based sensing for localization and presents a feature detection and tracking process with robust outlier rejection. This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a decentralized algorithm and a distributed approach for collaborative localization. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper presents a collaborative localization approach for groups of MAVs that communicate with each other. This falls under the domain of multi-agent systems. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a fusion of individual and relative measurements in a consistent fashion, which can be considered as an AI-based approach for improving pose estimation accuracy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
