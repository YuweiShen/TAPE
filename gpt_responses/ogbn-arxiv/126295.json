Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category. The paper also proposes a Deep Affinity Network (DAN) for data association in tracking, which involves learning compact yet comprehensive features of pre-detected objects and performing exhaustive pairing permutations of those features. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on popular multiple object tracking challenges, which indicates that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
