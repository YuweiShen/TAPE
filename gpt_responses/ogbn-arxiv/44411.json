This involves modeling the relationships between wrist movements during daily activities and clinical displays of movement abnormalities. The paper also uses clinically adopted severity measures as annotations for training the models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as the paper focuses on monitoring people with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CY (Computers and Society) are also likely sub-categories as the paper involves developing a method for objective monitoring of PD in the home environment. Finally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper uses Gaussian process models for estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
