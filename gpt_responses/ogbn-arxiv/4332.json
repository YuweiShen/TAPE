The paper specifically focuses on using front-facing device-centered cameras to capture reflections in the human eye, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the technical prototype and evaluation, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) aspects. Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of spatial sensing resolution, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
