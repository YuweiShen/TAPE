Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a new variant of Batch Normalization, which is a common technique used in deep learning for regularization. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the computational cost of the proposed method, which could make it relevant to the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
