The specific application of the indicator to the field of library and information science suggests a focus on information retrieval and digital libraries (cs.DL), as well as potentially cybersecurity (cs.CY) and social networks (cs.SI) given the recursive citation weighing aspect. The analysis of the sensitivity of the indicator to field classification schemes may also relate to the field of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
