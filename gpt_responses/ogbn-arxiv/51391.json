The use of Laplacian-based node signatures and heat kernel maps on edges suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The optimization problem formulation and integer quadratic program (IQP) approach suggest that the paper may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the experiments conducted on image sequences further support the paper's potential classification under cs.CV or cs.SI (signal processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
