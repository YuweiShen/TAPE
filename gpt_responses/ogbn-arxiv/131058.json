The use of Laplacian meshes is a technique commonly used in computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the use of linear least squares and optimization, which are common techniques in machine learning and computer graphics (cs.MM, cs.CG). Finally, the paper's approach involves using a reference image as a template, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
