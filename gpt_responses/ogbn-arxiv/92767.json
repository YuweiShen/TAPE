The paper also discusses applications in computer vision, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is a likely category. The use of probabilistic PCA-like algorithm and Bayesian-inspired methods suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are also likely categories.
