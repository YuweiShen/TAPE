The paper also proposes a fog computing architecture for efficient age estimation, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and networking (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed system in city surveillance and population analysis, which could be relevant to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
