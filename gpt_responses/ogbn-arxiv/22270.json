This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed framework uses adversarial training and projection techniques to find a common embedding subspace for low and high-resolution images. This involves machine learning techniques and falls under the sub-category of machine learning. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with face recognition using images, which is a form of multimedia. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed framework uses deep learning techniques to improve cross-resolution face recognition, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with face recognition, which is a form of information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
