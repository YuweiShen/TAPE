The paper also heavily relies on deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the design of a hardware/software architecture, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of coding rate, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the use of modulation and OFDM parameter recognition, which could fall under the category of computer science - architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
