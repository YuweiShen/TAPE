This method is used to compute the distributions of the weights of the DNN, which can be further used for estimating the epistemic uncertainty of the DNN by sampling an ensemble of networks from these distributions. The paper evaluates the proposed method on standard classification and regression benchmarks, and on out-of-distribution detection for classification and semantic segmentation. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also deals with optimization techniques, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method for tracking the trajectory of the weights during optimization, which can be seen as a control problem, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
