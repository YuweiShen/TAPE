This involves developing the meta-theory of smart contract languages and reasoning about concrete contracts, which are topics related to programming languages.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions that the proposed approach allows for making a connection between the deep and shallow embeddings in the form of a soundness theorem. This involves reasoning about the correctness of the embeddings, which is a topic related to logic in computer science.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the verification of smart contracts, which is a topic related to software engineering. The proposed framework could be useful for verifying the correctness of smart contracts in practice.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions that the proposed approach was applied to the Oak smart contract language and verified several important properties of a crowdfunding contract. This involves ensuring the security of the contract, which is a topic related to cryptography and security.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed approach involves using meta-programming techniques, which are related to data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
