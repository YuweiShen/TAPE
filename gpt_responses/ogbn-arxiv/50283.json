The paper proposes a novel framework for keyword-driven hierarchical classification, which involves heterogeneous information network embedding, keyword enrichment, topic modeling, and pseudo-document generation. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), social networks (cs.SI), and deep learning (cs.DL). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
