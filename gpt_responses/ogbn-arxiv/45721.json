It could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image compression. The use of deep learning techniques suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) could also be a possible sub-category as the paper deals with image quality improvement. Finally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) could be a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a scalable neural network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
