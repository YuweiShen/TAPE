The paper specifically focuses on detecting objects in images from fisheye cameras, which is a type of camera commonly used in robotics (cs.RO). The adaptation of existing methods to fisheye images involves modifying the geometry of the images, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also experiments with a real dataset of fisheye images, which could fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
