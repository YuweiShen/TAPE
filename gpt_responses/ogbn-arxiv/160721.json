Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of features and fluents, which are common concepts in machine learning and planning, respectively, making cs.LG and cs.PL likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of memory, which is a common concept in robotics, making cs.RO a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the problem of learning policies to fulfill non-Markovian goals, which is a common problem in control theory, making cs.SY a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
