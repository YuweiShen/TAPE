The paper also discusses retrieval and ranking problems, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of embeddings, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
