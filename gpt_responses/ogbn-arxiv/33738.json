Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Computer Vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel transfer learning method and uses Focal Loss, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) research. The proposed technique can also be integrated into autonomous inspection systems, which falls under Robotics (cs.RO) research. Finally, the paper deals with detecting damages on highway bridges, which is related to Cybersecurity and Cryptography (cs.CR) as it involves ensuring the structural health and reliability of critical infrastructure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
