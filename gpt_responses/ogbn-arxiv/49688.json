The abstract mentions hashing schemes, summaries, and edit distance, which are all related to data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses derandomization, which is a topic in computational complexity. Finally, the paper proposes new error correcting codes, which are relevant to information theory and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
