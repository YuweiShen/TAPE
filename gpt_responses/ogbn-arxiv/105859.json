This is a core topic in computational complexity theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses finite state machines as verifiers, which are a fundamental data structure in computer science. The techniques used to analyze the verifiers may also involve algorithmic ideas.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper may involve some logical reasoning to establish the equivalence between different characterizations of NL.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions games of incomplete information, which is a topic studied in game theory and AI.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper's corollary relates to games of incomplete information, which is a topic studied in game theory and CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
