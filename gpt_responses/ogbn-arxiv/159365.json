Additionally, the control algorithm can be seen as a type of intelligent decision-making system.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Similar to cs.AI, the sampling-based approach in the control design phase can be seen as a type of machine learning technique.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): Although the paper does not focus on software engineering, the implementation of the proposed control algorithm on an experimental testbed involves software development and integration, which can be considered as a software engineering task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
