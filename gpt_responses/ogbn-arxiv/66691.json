This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses simulation-based comparisons with cyclic prefix-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM), which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
