This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of machine learning models in self-driving cars, which is a robotics application. The proposed approach is also relevant to autonomous vehicles, which is a key area of robotics research.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper focuses on the training of machine learning models for steering angle estimation in autonomous cars. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of AI techniques (specifically, machine learning) in autonomous cars. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of a vision-based approach for steering angle estimation, which is a control problem. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
