The paper also discusses the runtime performance and accuracy of DL frameworks, which could be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper mentions the resource consumption patterns and their performance implications, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
