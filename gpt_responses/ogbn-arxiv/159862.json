The use of geometric queries such as dominance and rectangle visibility suggests that it may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The inclusion of semigroup and group queries such as sum, average, variance, minimum and maximum suggests that it may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category.
