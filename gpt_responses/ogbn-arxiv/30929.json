The paper discusses the task of generating good questions in open-domain conversational systems, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and specifically conversational AI. The paper proposes a novel approach using typed decoders, which involves estimating a type distribution over three types of words (interrogatives, topic words, and ordinary words) to generate more meaningful questions. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of CS, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
