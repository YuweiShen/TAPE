Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions the use of edge computing, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). The system's robustness against uncertain request arrivals is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
