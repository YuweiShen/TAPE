Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The paper also discusses the use of external payments to stabilize coalitional games, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence and multiagent systems, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also presents algorithmic properties and bounds, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the model to decision-making in political bodies, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
