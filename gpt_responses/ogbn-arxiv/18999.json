The proposed approach involves writing requirements in the programming language itself, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) and embedded systems (cs.EM). The use of Design by Contract and Hoare-style assertions also suggests a focus on logic and verification (cs.LO), while the application to a specific industrial example highlights the relevance to engineering and technology (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
