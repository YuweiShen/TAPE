The paper discusses the optimal transmission strategy for two small-cell base stations to offload their data to a common macro-cell base station. This falls under the scope of cs.NI. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the transmission strategy based on channel state information. This involves the use of information theory concepts such as channel capacity, coding, and modulation. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with offloading data from small-cell base stations, which are typically used for multimedia applications such as video streaming. The paper discusses the use of cooperative wireless backhauling to boost the backhaul capacity, which is important for multimedia applications. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the optimal transmission strategy for two small-cell base stations to cooperate and boost the backhaul capacity. This involves the use of control theory concepts such as optimization and decision-making. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not explicitly discuss security or cryptography, but wireless backhauling is a critical component of cellular networks, and security is an important consideration in such networks. The paper may touch upon some security aspects of wireless backhauling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
