Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as they are closely related to the topic of object detection and pose estimation. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the application of the system in real-world scenarios, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
