It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a framework that incorporates multiple types of supervisions and light-weight modules. Additionally, it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it aims to improve the performance of autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and unmanned surface vessels. The robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also a possibility as the proposed framework could be applied to robotics tasks. Finally, the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category is less likely but still possible as the paper mentions the use of object detection and segmentation in security-related applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
