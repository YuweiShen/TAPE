It proposes quantitative and scalable tools for assessing the diversity of GAN distributions, taking a classification-based perspective and viewing loss of diversity as a form of covariate shift introduced by GANs. The paper is likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
