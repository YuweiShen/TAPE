The use of sparse models and the Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) framework suggests that the paper belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) categories. The use of projection in Krylov subspaces and the Partial Effective Rank (PER) criterion suggests that the paper also belongs to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Matrix Analysis (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the use of field measurements and synthetic AWGN suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
