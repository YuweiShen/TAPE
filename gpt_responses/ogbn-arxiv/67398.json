The use of top trees is a novel approach to this problem, which could also be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the performance of the compression scheme in terms of worst-case compression and navigational queries, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
