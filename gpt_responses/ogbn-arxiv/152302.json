This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n2. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with distributed consensus-based observer networks, which is a common topic in multi-agent systems. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of communication graphs in distributed state estimation, which is a networking and internet architecture problem. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve information theory concepts such as channel capacity and coding theory in the context of distributed state estimation. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may involve machine learning techniques for distributed state estimation using networked observers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
