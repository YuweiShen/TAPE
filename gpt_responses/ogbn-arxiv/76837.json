The use of relative entropy and backoff also suggests a connection to information theory. The probabilistic constraint and bounded expectation of sample size may also relate to statistical inference (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the examples provided may involve multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
