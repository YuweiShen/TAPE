The paper discusses the use of layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to trace the classification decision back to individual words. This technique is used to decompose the predictions of two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, onto words. The paper also introduces a measure of model explanatory power and compares the SVM and CNN models in terms of explainability. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
