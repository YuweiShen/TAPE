The paper also discusses generalizing MAPF methods to real-world scenarios, which involves addressing issues related to scalability, uncertainty, and dynamic environments, among others. These issues are relevant to research in systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG), as they require developing methods that can adapt to changing conditions and handle large amounts of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
