This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation, which is a technique commonly used in neural network research in the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
