The paper proposes a new method for solving this problem that uses cheap anytime confidence bounds on the function being maximized. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper proposes novel confidence bounds for conditional entropy, which is a common measure used in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method in real-world decision-making problems, which suggests that it may be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
