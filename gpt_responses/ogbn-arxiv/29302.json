The paper also mentions compressed sensing with coherent redundant dictionaries, which is a common topic in information theory (cs.IT). The simulations are performed on natural images, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely category. The use of an analysis reweighted $\\ell _{1}$ formulation suggests machine learning (cs.LG) as a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with optimization algorithms for compressive imaging, which falls under mathematical optimization (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
