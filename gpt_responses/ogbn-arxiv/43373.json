The focus is on acyclic networks with delay, which is a subfield of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of finite-field discrete Fourier transform, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper deals with the transformation of networks, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS).
