Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the activation functions used in deep networks, which is a topic in neural networks and computational neuroscience, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the practical aspects of training deep networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical results on the learnability of deep networks, which is a topic in statistical learning theory and information theory, making cs.SI (Information Theory) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
