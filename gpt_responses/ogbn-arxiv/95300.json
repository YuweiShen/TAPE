This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses techniques from graph theory and matrix theory, which are relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the access-optimality of the codes, which is related to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the field size of the codes, which is relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
