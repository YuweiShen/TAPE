Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses the use of standards such as ISO/IEC 25010 and Automotive-SPICE, which are related to system quality assurance (cs.QA) and system modeling (cs.SY). The authors propose a new process to design or adapt the quality model, which involves the use of attributes to characterize the design quality model (cs.PL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of qualimetry, which is a young science that involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to quantify quality (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
