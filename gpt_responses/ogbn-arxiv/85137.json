Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, which is directly related to the design of error-correcting codes. \n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the design of polar codes for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems, which are commonly used in communication and networking applications. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social networks, the use of multi-carrier systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is commonly used in wireless networks, which fall under the domain of social and information networks. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of error-correcting codes for communication systems, which is directly related to the networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): While the paper does not focus on data structures and algorithms, the proposed density evolution-based construction methods can be seen as an algorithmic approach to designing good polar codes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
