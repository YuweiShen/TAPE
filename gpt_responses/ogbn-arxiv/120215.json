The algorithm proposed in the paper involves iterative computation of beamforming weights, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing. The paper also discusses the minimization of a negative log-likelihood function, which is a common approach in statistical modeling. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SP (Speech Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
