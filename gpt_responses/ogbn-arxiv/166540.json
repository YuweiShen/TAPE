The paper also discusses the use of formal methods such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory, which is a sub-field of computer science concerned with automated reasoning (cs.CR). The paper also mentions safety-critical applications, which suggests a connection to the sub-field of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a new data set of benchmarks, which is relevant to the sub-field of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
