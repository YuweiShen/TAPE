This falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of cosine similarity as a distance measure and the introduction of geometric characteristics suggest a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments conducted using RusVectores resources indicate a possible application in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
