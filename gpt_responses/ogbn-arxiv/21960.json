The proposed method involves learning a hashing function that transfers semantics from auxiliary contextual modalities, which can be seen as a form of transfer learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces novel constraints on the hash codes, which can be seen as a form of optimization (cs.MM) and the method involves a unified framework that simultaneously preserves visual similarities and performs semantic transfer, which can be seen as a form of machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
