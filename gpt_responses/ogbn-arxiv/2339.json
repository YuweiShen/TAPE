This is a common problem in machine learning and optimization, and can be applied to a wide range of applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and data science. The paper proposes a general optimization approach, called smoothing proximal gradient method, which can solve the structured sparse regression problems with a smooth convex loss and a wide spectrum of structured-sparsity-inducing penalties. The paper also provides numerical results to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed method. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
