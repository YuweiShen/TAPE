This involves signal processing, communication theory, and machine learning techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves simulations and performance analysis, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
