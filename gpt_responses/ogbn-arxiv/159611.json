The method is also applicable to various types of data, including images (cs.CV) and natural language (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of labels to discount prior information, which is a common technique in supervised learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the objective function, which is a common topic in optimization and numerical methods (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
