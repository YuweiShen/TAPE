The authors propose a method that involves learning an autoencoder over the set of annotations to derive a regularizer, which is then used to train the actual network of interest. This involves modeling and predicting label structure, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also involves natural language processing, as the authors mention that their method can be applied to text classification tasks (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
