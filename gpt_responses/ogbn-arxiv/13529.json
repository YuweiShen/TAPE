The proposed model uses several novel mechanisms such as enhancing the capacity of encoder, modeling long-term dependencies of contexts, refining the predicted answer span, and directly optimizing the evaluation metric, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
