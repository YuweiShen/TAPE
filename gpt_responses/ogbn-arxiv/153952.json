The proposed method involves training a model to predict facial expressions on-the-fly, which requires real-time processing and could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of affective interactive agents, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
