This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as the primary sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of multi-task learning and deep neural networks, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of regression, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
