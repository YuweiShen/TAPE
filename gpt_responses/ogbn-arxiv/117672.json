The paper also discusses the challenges of conducting linkage on records from multiple parties/sources, which involves cryptographic techniques to ensure privacy (cs.CR). The proposed approach involves clustering, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the scalability limitations of existing approaches, which is a topic of interest in cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using real datasets, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
