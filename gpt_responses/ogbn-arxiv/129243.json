This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of state-of-the-art convex relaxations of AC power flow equations suggests that distributed computing techniques may have been employed. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper deals with the impact of GMDs on power systems, which is an emerging area of research. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): There is no direct connection to programming languages in the paper, but the optimization problem formulation and solution may involve programming languages and related tools. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves the development of a computational model and optimization problem to address a problem in engineering (power systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
