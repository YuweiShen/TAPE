The system uses activation distributions to summarize what a model has learned, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses comparing activation distributions across classes and instances, which is a common task in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
