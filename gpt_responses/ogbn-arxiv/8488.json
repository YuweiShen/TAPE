The paper also proposes a novel RoI Tanh-warping operator, which involves the use of neural networks, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of hierarchical local-based methods and global methods, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MM (Multimedia).
