It may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves generating 3D reconstructions. The use of neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the efficient representation of the surface reconstruction suggests that it could also belong to the neural networks and learning (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
