The use of sensors and actuators to communicate with the car's systems and surroundings suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO). The development of an intelligent system for safety purposes involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of human-centered design and assisting the driver in various conditions, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
