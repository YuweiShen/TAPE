The use of deep neural networks for feature extraction suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The tracking aspect of the algorithm suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the evaluation on large-scale datasets suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
