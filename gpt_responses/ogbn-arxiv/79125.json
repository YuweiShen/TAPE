In particular, involutions are widely used in cryptography and coding theory, which suggests that cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves algebraic techniques, which could place it in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the paper proposes a general method for constructing involutions, which could be relevant to cs.SD (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
