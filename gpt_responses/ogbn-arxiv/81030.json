Additionally, the paper discusses the use of motion vectors and prediction residuals, which are commonly used in video compression (cs.MM) and video processing (cs.IR) research. The paper also discusses the acceleration of algorithms, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category, but the focus on image and video processing makes it less likely. Finally, the use of transfer learning is also relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
