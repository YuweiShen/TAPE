The approach proposed involves linking objects across short and long ranges, which requires machine learning techniques such as regression and classification, falling under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset, which is a benchmark dataset for multimedia analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves non-maximum suppression algorithm, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
