This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of masks to indicate regions of interest in medical images, which could also fall under the computer vision sub-category. The paper also discusses training networks to ignore distracting features, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of saliency maps to visualize the distracting features could also fall under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of the mask information on generalization accuracy, which could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
