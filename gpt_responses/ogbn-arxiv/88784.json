The paper also presents a new branching heuristic and a variant of discrepancy search, which are both related to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.CC). The use of theoretical and practical evidence to support the effectiveness of the techniques suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
