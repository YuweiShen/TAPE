The problem of sequential frame synchronization is also relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of energy as a metric for synchronization threshold suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the study of channel transition probabilities and error rates is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
