The paper proposes distributed age-efficient transmission policies for random access channels with M transmitters, which involves analyzing the age performance of stationary randomized policies and proposing the notion of age-gain of a packet. The paper also proves the asymptotic optimality of slotted ALOHA-type algorithms for small arrival rates and provides a multiplicative factor of at least two compared to the minimum age under slotted ALOHA for arrival rates theta=1/o(M). Overall, the paper's focus on age of information in random access channels makes it most likely to belong to cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SY, cs.MA, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
