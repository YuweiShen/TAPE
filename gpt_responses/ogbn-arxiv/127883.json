This is a classic game theory problem, and the paper proposes mechanisms that truthfully elicit information from the merchants and maximize social welfare. \n2. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): The paper deals with the intersection of economics and computation, specifically in the context of daily deals platforms. It proposes a mechanism design approach to optimize the allocation of deals and payments among merchants, which is a common problem in the field of economics and computation. \n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational approach to designing markets for daily deals, which involves developing algorithms and mechanisms that can handle the large number of submarkets and localities. This falls under the purview of computational engineering, finance, and science. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms and mechanisms for selecting good deals and determining merchant payments, which involves processing and analyzing large amounts of data. This falls under the purview of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with the interaction between multiple agents (mer"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
