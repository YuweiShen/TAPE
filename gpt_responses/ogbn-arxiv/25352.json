The use of pattern matching and codebook generation also involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The cross-entropy approach and k-median problem are optimization techniques that fall under machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of compression techniques in document images is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
