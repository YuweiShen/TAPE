This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Databases (cs.DB) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the language in an event-driven fashion, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper provides a formal semantics for the proposed framework, which suggests that it may also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
