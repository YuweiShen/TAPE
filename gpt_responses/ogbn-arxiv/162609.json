The most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on natural language processing and generation. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning models, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another likely category. The toolkit's ability to handle multiple sources and references could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the use of n-gram based metrics and BERTScore suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible category. Finally, the mention of image captioning and video description tasks suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a potential category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
