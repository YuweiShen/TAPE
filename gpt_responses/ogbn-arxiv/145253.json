The method uses both long-range dependencies within the sentence and potentially large contexts formed from adjacent sentences. Therefore, it is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
