The concept of automaticity is related to information theory (cs.IT), and the construction of invariant measures is a topic in both dynamical systems (cs.DS) and probability theory (cs.PR). The use of the left shift map suggests a connection to symbolic dynamics (cs.DM), and the Ledrappier cellular automaton is a specific example of a system that can be analyzed using tools from control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
