The approach involves extracting part-level features and restricting the local context to encourage generalizability to unseen categories. This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques for 3D shape segmentation and machine learning (LG) for learning the grouping policy. It also involves graph theory (GR) for agglomerative clustering and artificial intelligence (AI) for formulating the problem as a contextual bandit problem. Finally, natural language processing (CL) may be relevant for the text analysis and interpretation of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
