It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it discusses the use of differential evolution for generating adversarial attacks. Additionally, it falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it explores the limitations of current DNNs and their susceptibility to attacks. The paper also touches upon the topic of cybersecurity (cs.CR) as it discusses the potential threat of adversarial attacks on neural networks. Finally, it involves the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE) as it deals with the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
