The proposed framework also involves handling different types of LiDAR, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for processing the LiDAR data. The paper also mentions the use of sparse pose graphs, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
