The method involves learning a residual on top of an initial controller, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The tasks involve partial observability and sensor noise, which could also fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes experiments with visual input, which could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
