Additionally, the paper focuses on extracting regional languages, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of deep learning techniques for text recognition and language translation also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves GPS coordinates and location-based information, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of neural networks and deep learning models suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
