The algorithmic aspect of detecting maximal cliques falls under the subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.DM). The use of durations in the link streams also relates to the subfield of temporal data mining (cs.SD). Finally, the paper proposes an algorithm that involves information theory (cs.IT) to improve the detection of maximal cliques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
