The proposed method involves using class semantics as prototypes for object detection, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the challenges of class imbalance and knowledge forgetting, which are common issues in deep learning (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a rebalanced loss function, which is a technique used in optimization and training of deep neural networks (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
