This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as the tool is used for analyzing and retrieving information from large-scale image data. The use of deep learning (cs.DL) is also mentioned in the paper as a potential method for improving detection accuracy. The tool is designed in close cooperation with pathologists, indicating a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect. Finally, the paper mentions the visualization of microscopy images, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
