Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes modifications to existing NLI architectures, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The use of neural networks in NLI also suggests the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of attention mechanisms, which is a popular technique in computer vision, suggesting the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
