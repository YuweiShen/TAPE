This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not directly deal with social networks, but the concept of nested lattice codes can be applied to network coding and distributed storage, which are relevant to this sub-category.\n3. cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability) - The paper deals with capacity achieving codes and source coding, which are core topics in information theory and probability.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with source coding for arbitrary continuous sources, which is relevant to multimedia applications.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - While not directly related to data structures and algorithms, the concept of nested lattice codes involves constructing a hierarchy of lattices, which can be seen as a type of data structure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
