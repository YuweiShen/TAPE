The paper also involves the study of state sequences and their impact on communication, which is related to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of examples involving Gaussian channels and joint design of communication phases suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories.
