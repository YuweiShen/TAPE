It also involves the use of R\\'enyi capacity, which is a concept in computational complexity (cs.CC) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The notion of \"channel diameter\" and the data processing inequality are related to network information theory (cs.NI) and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
