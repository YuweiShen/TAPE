The paper also proposes a practical attack that targets the dispersion of internal feature maps, which involves machine learning techniques such as optimization and regularization, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on computer vision tasks provided by Google Cloud Vision APIs, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
