The authors propose a new method for storing the occupancy of the environment and computing the risk along a path, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also presents a framework for generating navigation paths, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
