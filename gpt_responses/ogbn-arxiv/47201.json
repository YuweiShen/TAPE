This involves using simulated LiDAR scan data to construct 2D occupancy grid bitmaps, which are then labeled with human-scale navigational features and recognized by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is evaluated in both simulation and the real world, and the performance of using input occupancy grids obtained directly from LiDAR data or incrementally constructed with SLAM is compared. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
