The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for identifying crops and weeds, robotics (RO) for plant-specific treatment, and machine learning (LG, AI) for training the model. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of information retrieval (IR) techniques for identifying relevant literature. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.RO, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
