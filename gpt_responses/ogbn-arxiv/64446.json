Hence, cs.GT is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves decision-making by leaders and followers, which is a common theme in AI research. Additionally, the paper discusses solution concepts, which is a topic that is relevant to AI. Hence, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Computer Science - Learning): The paper involves learning the correlated strategies to commit to in games with multiple leaders and followers. Hence, cs.LG is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.DS (Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed solution concepts. Hence, cs.DS is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.SI (Computer Science - Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with decision-making in social networks, which is a topic that falls under the domain of social networks.
