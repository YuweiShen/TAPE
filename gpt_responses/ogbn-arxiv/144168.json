Therefore, the most likely category is \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning), which is the primary focus of the paper. The paper also deals with communication and information theory aspects of the proposed framework, which makes \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory) a likely sub-category. The proposed framework involves wireless communication between edge devices and the edge server, which makes \"cs.NI\" (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the convergence analysis of the proposed framework, which makes \"cs.SY\" (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a digital version of a broadband over-the-air aggregation scheme, which involves signal processing and modulation techniques, making \"cs.MM\" (Multimedia) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
