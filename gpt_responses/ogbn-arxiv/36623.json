The use of end-to-end deep neural networks and Multi-Modal Multi-Task Learning suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of labeled data and training neural networks, which are common themes in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the complexity of the driving task and the need to consider multiple behavioral modalities, which suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
