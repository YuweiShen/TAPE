Additionally, the paper discusses the use of supervised learning and imitation learning, which are common techniques in machine learning. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it focuses on learning goal-reaching behaviors, which is a common problem in robotics. Computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant category as the paper discusses the use of visual inputs in some of the experiments. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) as it proposes a new algorithm for learning control policies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
