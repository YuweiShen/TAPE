The use of DACs and ADCs also suggests a possible fit in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on optimizing the transmit signal vector for minimum BER suggests a possible fit in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
