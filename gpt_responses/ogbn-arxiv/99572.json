The specific focus on Gaussian networks and feedback also suggests cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) and cs.SI (signal processing) as likely categories. The use of novel coding schemes and analysis techniques may also make cs.MM (multimedia) a relevant category. Finally, the paper's theoretical nature and focus on capacity gains may also make cs.LG (machine learning) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
