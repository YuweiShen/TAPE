The paper discusses the use of differential privacy and Chebyshev expansion to derive the approximate polynomial representation of objective functions. The experiments are conducted on health social network data and handwriting digit dataset for human behavior prediction, classification, and recognition tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
