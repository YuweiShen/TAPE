The use of possibilistic logic also suggests a connection to cryptography and security (cs.CR), as well as data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses preferences and priorities, which could be relevant to programming languages and formal methods (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
