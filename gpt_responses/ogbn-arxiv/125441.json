Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the safety implications of mobile phone usage while driving, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification suggests a possible fit with cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
