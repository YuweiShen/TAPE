The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and efficient data structures (cs.DS) to handle large datasets. Additionally, the paper discusses the allocation of objects onto a 2D grid layout, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper mentions the use of optimization algorithms (cs.LG) to solve the visualization task at hand."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
