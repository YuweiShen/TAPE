Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper proposes a new class of stabilizing switching signals, which could fall under cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses prior results based on point-wise and asymptotic characterizations, which could be relevant to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
