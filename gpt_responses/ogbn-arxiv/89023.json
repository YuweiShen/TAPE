The approach involves local identification of feature cells, grouping feature cells into extended features, and tracking movement of features through overlapping in space. This work is likely to fall under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This paper deals with the identification and tracking of features in images, which is a core area of computer vision. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): This paper involves the visualization of spatio-temporal features in fusion reactor data, which is a key area of graphics research. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): This paper involves the use of numerical methods to detect and track spatio-temporal features in fusion reactor data. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This paper involves the use of parallelization techniques to detect and track spatio-temporal features in fusion reactor data, which is a key area of research in distributed systems and networks. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This paper involves the use of parallelization techniques to detect and track spatio-temporal features in fusion reactor data, which is a key area of research in distributed systems and networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
