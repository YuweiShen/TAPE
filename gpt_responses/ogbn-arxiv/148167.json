Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The problem involves broadcasting information to multiple receivers, which suggests that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces new techniques to obtain better lower bounds, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
