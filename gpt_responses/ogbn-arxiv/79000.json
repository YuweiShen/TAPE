This involves the use of joint queue state information and joint channel state information, and the problem is modeled as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Problem (POMDP). The proposed solution involves a distributive online stochastic learning algorithm that only requires local information at each base station. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
