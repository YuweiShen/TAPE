The paper also proposes a novel algorithm for training these networks, which involves a feedback mechanism and self-generated training instances, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of deep neural networks suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and the use of large datasets suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
