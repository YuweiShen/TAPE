This involves taking actions based on contexts and learning based only on a reward signal from the action taken, thereby generating an exploration/exploitation trade-off. The paper also compares the proposed algorithm to seven strong baseline contextual bandit algorithms on a set of three hundred real-world datasets. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
