It also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques, as it proposes a paradigm for early detection and classification of target samples. Additionally, the use of optimal frameworks for different target samples suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) in the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
