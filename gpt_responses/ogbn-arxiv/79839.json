The paper discusses an approach for improving open-domain question answering systems using unsupervised learning and a term bank, which are topics related to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) in computer science. The paper also mentions the use of vector spaces, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, the paper focuses on answering complex questions, which is a topic related to deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in general. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
