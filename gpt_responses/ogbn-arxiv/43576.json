The paper proposes algorithms for computing the outcomes of the competitive rule for chores, which is a well-known mechanism for allocating goods with additive utilities. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.GT (Computer Science > Computer Science and Game Theory): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the intersection of computer science and game theory, including mechanism design, social choice theory, and algorithmic game theory. The paper clearly belongs to this sub-category as it deals with a problem in mechanism design and proposes algorithms for computing the outcomes of a well-known mechanism. \n\n- cs.DS (Computer Science > Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers papers that deal with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. The paper proposes algorithms for computing the outcomes of the competitive rule for chores, which involves constructing consumption graphs, computing maximum flows, and checking for Pareto optimality and envy-freeness. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category as well. \n\n- cs.AI (Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers that deal with various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.
