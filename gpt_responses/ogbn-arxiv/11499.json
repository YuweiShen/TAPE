The paper also involves object manipulation and computer vision techniques such as data augmentation, which suggests that it could also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The use of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques for training the policies suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories.
