The paper proposes a new method for scale-sensitive object detection, which involves learning the scale of objects in an image. This could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. The proposed method also aims to be efficient and practical, which could relate to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
