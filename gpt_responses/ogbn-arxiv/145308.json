The use of RANSAC, a popular algorithm in computer vision (cs.CV), is also mentioned. The paper proposes an incremental version of RANSAC, which involves updating the model as new data is received, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The problem of dealing with outlier measurements is also mentioned, which is a common issue in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
