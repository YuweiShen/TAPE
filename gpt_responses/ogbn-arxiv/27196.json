The paper also discusses two main strategies: contact model-based and contact model-free, which involve learning algorithms (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the whole robotic assembly system, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
