This involves the use of large scale data and the design of a set of visual features. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR) which deals with the retrieval of information from large-scale data. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of computer vision techniques to extract visual features from creatives, which suggests that Computer Vision (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of visual features for CTR prediction, ranking, and performance classification, which suggests that Multimedia (cs.MM) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) could also be relevant sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the study of user response in online advertising, which could fall under the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it relates to user privacy and security concerns in online advertising."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
