The paper also mentions the use of visual servoing and tele-operation, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves testing on a physical robot, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes motion planning frameworks, which could involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
