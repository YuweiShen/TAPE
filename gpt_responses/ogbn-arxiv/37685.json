Additionally, the paper extensively discusses subjective tests and human perception, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning the saliency evaluation metric also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on evaluating and improving existing metrics aligns with the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
