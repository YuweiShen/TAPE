The use of orthonormal basis for sparsity is also a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper may involve numerical analysis (cs.NA) as it deals with the reconstruction of signals using sampling functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
