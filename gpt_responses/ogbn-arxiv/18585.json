The paper also introduces a capacity-based formula for link transmission bit-rates, which relates to information theory (cs.IT). The use of percolation in routing and the analysis of the system of communal highways suggest the involvement of mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of power growth on network expansion, which relates to the field of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
