The paper focuses on video analysis, which is a common application of 3D CNNs, and proposes a regularization-based method for assigning different regularization parameters to different weight groups based on their importance to the network. The paper also analyzes the redundancy and computation cost for each layer to determine the different pruning ratios. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) are also possible sub-categories since the paper deals with video analysis and neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
