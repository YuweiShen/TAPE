The paper also mentions the use of Gr\u00f6bner basis algorithms, which are commonly used in algebraic geometry and computational algebraic geometry. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.AG (Algebraic Geometry), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions the use of algorithms and complexity estimates, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
