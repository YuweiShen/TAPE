This makes cs.CR the most likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with deep neural networks and their fine-tuning for cooperative analytics, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions evaluating the local inference cost of different layers on a modern handset for mobile applications, which suggests the use of computer vision models.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the challenges of processing large and complex deep models on the cloud and proposes a hybrid approach for breaking them down. This falls under the domain of distributed and parallel computing.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hybrid approach for cooperative analytics, which involves breaking down deep models and fine-tuning them in a particular way. This can be seen as a control problem in systems engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
