This is a common problem in machine learning and density estimation is a fundamental concept in this field. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with estimating expected polynomials of density functions from samples, which is a statistical problem. The proposed estimator is based on local likelihood density estimators, which is a statistical method. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions that estimating expected polynomials of density functions has applications in information theory. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Density estimation is a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence, and the proposed estimator could be useful in various AI applications. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): Density estimation is also a common problem in computer vision, and the proposed estimator could be useful in this field as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
