However, the approach used in the paper involves the integration of crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) with multi-task (MT) learning, which is a popular technique in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the primary category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of transfer learning, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing and computer vision. Therefore, it is also likely to be categorized under cs.MS (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper involves the use of CGCNN, which is a deep learning architecture that involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting material properties.
