The specific problem studied, distance-d dominating-set problem, is a variation of the dominating set problem, which is a classic problem in computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions classes of graphs with bounded expansion, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
