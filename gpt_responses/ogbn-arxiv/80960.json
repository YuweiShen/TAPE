It also involves the use of histograms for estimating mutual information, which falls under the category of optimization and control (cs.OH). The paper also discusses the simulation of a transoceanic fiber system, which involves network architecture and protocols (cs.NI) and physical optics (cs.PH). Finally, the paper deals with the performance of different modulation schemes and digital signal processing techniques, which is related to communication (cs.COMM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
