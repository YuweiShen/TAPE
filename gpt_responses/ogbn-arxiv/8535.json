This involves modeling the agent's behavior as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and using maximum likelihood estimation and constrained Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to learn its internal model and reward function. The paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
