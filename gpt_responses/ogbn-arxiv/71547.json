Therefore, cs.CL and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The use of neural models and training objectives also suggests a focus on machine learning (ML), which could lead to sub-categories such as cs.LG and cs.AI. Finally, the paper's emphasis on sub-word units and phone-like detectors suggests a focus on speech recognition, which could lead to sub-categories such as cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
