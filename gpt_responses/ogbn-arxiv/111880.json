The use of deep neural network models for state transitions and the development of planning methods based on these models also falls under these categories. The paper also discusses the application of these methods in control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the optimization techniques used in the paper may also be relevant to the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
