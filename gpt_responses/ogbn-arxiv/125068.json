The paper proposes a novel loss function for label super resolution, which involves modeling the inter-instance variance. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also tests its method on two real-world applications, which may make it relevant to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
