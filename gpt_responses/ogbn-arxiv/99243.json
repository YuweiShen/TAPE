The paper also utilizes machine learning techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a scalable state design and distributed learning algorithms, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
