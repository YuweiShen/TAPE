This involves traversing textual data like a KB and using a combination of sparse-matrix TFIDF indices and a maximum inner product search (MIPS) on a special index of contextual representations of the mentions. The paper also discusses a pretraining scheme for the contextual representation encoder using existing knowledge bases. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper involves natural language processing and neural networks. The sub-categories cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DB (Databases) are also likely, as the paper involves searching and indexing textual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
