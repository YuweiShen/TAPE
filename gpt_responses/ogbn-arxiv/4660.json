It could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) because text recognition is often a part of image processing tasks. The paper also discusses the use of a piece-wise function to reinterpret the CTC loss, which is a machine learning technique, so it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper's focus on sequence learning and the use of a novel re-weighting method could also make it relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
