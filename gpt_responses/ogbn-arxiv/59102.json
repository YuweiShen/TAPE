The paper also proposes a novel receiver architecture and discusses the benefits of using the proposed technique during the initial access phase, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also focuses on the use of analog beamforming, which is a key aspect of Massive MIMO systems and falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel technique for channel estimation, which falls under the sub-category of Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
