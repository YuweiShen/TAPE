The paper also proposes a new approach to segment recognition based on learned descriptors, which involves training the CNNs using labeled data, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with real-world data collected in an urban driving scenario, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
