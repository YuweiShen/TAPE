The proposed network uses state of the art region based convolutional neural network (RCNN) and has been evaluated over various publicly available biometric databases. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper deals with biometric authentication, which can be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia). As the paper involves security and privacy concerns, it can also be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves image processing techniques, which can be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
