It specifically focuses on the construction of measurement matrices, which is related to signal processing (cs.SP) and matrix theory (cs.MM). The use of spatial coupling is a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to the subfield of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses optimization techniques, which are relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
