The paper specifically focuses on formation control, which is a sub-topic of multi-agent systems. Therefore, cs.MA (multi-agent systems) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of event-triggered controllers, which is a technique used in robotics and control systems, falling under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also deals with connectivity preservation, which is a topic related to distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper involves the use of numerical simulations, which is a technique used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, falling under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
