The use of a novel path length metric and the integration with the RRT* algorithm involves optimization and machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The presence of stochastic disturbances and the need to perceive the environment for safe navigation suggest a control systems and systems engineering perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the use of perception cost and the numerical studies involving simulations of the robot's environment suggest a computer vision component (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
