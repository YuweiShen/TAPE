The authors derive bounds on localization accuracy, which involves statistical inference and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also considers the use of a priori knowledge, which is a common theme in control systems (cs.SY). The authors use simulations to evaluate their results, which involves networked systems and communication (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of map features on localization accuracy, which is related to computer vision and image processing (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
