The paper also mentions applications in secret sharing schemes, which falls under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The construction of codes from plateaued Boolean functions and their weight distributions is related to Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the analysis of the constructed codes for secret sharing schemes, which is relevant to the Cryptography (cs.CR) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
