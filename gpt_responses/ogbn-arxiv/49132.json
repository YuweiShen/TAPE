Additionally, the paper discusses the use of second-order Langevin equation, which is a popular method in machine learning for sampling from probability distributions. The paper may also be relevant to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV) as these fields often use SG-MCMC methods and related techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
