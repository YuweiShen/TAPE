This falls under the purview of information theory, which deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers a multi-user transmission scenario with multiple data streams for each user, which requires efficient resource allocation and scheduling algorithms. This is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture, which deals with the design and analysis of communication networks. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint analog precoder/combiner (JAPC) design to further reduce the SMSE between the transmit and receive signals. This involves the use of control theory techniques to optimize the system performance. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of a hybrid precoding scheme for millimeter-wave MIMO systems, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as high-definition video streaming and virtual reality. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly address any social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the design of future communication systems that impact society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
