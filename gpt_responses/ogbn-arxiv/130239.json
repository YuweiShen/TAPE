The proposed approach is based on directly learning regression trees for graph inputs using a newly derived bound of the total sum of squares for data partitions by a given subgraph feature, and thus can learn nonlinear models through standard gradient boosting. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
