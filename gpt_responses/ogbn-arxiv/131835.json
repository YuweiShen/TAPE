The paper also considers jointly-correlated fading, which is a topic in wireless communications (cs.MM). The use of statistical channel state information (CSI) and the iterative algorithm proposed for precoder design suggest a focus on signal processing and optimization (cs.SI). The paper also mentions reducing computational complexity, which is a topic in computer networks (cs.NI) and the use of multiple access channels suggests a focus on communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
