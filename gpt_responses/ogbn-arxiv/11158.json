This is a central topic in computational complexity theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses Lagrange interpolation, which is a well-known technique in algorithms and data structures for polynomial interpolation and approximation.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper mentions the use of Lagrange interpolation for constructing geometric objects such as curves and surfaces, which is a common application of interpolation in computational geometry.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper deals with the complexity of evaluating polynomials, which is a central topic in symbolic computation. The use of exponential sums and products also suggests a connection to symbolic computation.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the relationship between boolean and algebraic complexity, which is a topic that falls under the scope of logic in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
