The paper focuses on the over-parameterized regime, where the number of parameters in the neural network is much larger than the number of training samples. This is a central topic in the field of deep learning, and it is studied in several sub-areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and signal processing (cs.SI). Given the focus of the paper on the convergence analysis of deep neural networks, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG, followed by cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
