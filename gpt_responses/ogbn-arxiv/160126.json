The paper also discusses the discrepancies between the explanations generated for the predictions of a model on clean and adversarial data, which is related to the field of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed framework for identifying adversarial attacks is based on neural networks, which is related to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
