This involves estimating the locations of blocked antennas and the induced attenuation and phase shifts, which can be seen as a signal processing problem. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the effects of blockages on the far-field radiation pattern of antenna arrays, which can impact the performance of wireless networks. The proposed diagnosis techniques can be used to improve the reliability and efficiency of millimeter wave communication systems. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper may be relevant to the design and optimization of antenna arrays for social networks and other applications that rely on wireless communication. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper may be relevant to the design and optimization of antenna arrays for multimedia applications that require high-speed wireless communication, such as video streaming and virtual reality. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a diagnosis technique for millimeter wave antenna arrays, which can be seen as a control problem. The proposed technique aims to identify and mitigate the effects of blockages on the array's radiation pattern, which can be seen as a form of control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
