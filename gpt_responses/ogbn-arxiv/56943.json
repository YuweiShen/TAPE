The analysis of the impact of increasing the number of scatterers on achieving perfect secrecy involves system-level considerations and optimization, which could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of simulations to validate the theoretical results, which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
