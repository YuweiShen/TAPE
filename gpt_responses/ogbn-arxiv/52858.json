The Hypercontractive Inequality is a well-known result in these areas, and the paper presents a new version of the inequality that is specifically tailored to functions of bounded Fourier width. Therefore, it is likely that the paper would be of interest to researchers in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
