The use of regular look-ahead is a specific technique used in tree transducers, which is a type of automaton that operates on trees, making cs.PL (programming languages) a likely category as well. The paper also presents algorithms for decision-making and construction, which suggests a focus on data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
