Specifically, the paper focuses on recovery guarantees for these networks, which suggests a focus on optimization and convergence analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of activation functions in neural networks, which is a topic that falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
