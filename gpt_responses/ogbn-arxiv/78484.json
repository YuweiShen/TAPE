This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The system also uses Tesseract OCR engine for character recognition, which involves natural language processing techniques. Hence, cs.CL is also a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the development of a system that can read text from images, which is a common task in information retrieval. Therefore, cs.IR is another likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may involve the use of machine learning techniques for text detection and recognition. Hence, cs.LG is also a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to develop a system for visually impaired people, which involves human-computer interaction. Therefore, cs.HC is a less likely but possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
