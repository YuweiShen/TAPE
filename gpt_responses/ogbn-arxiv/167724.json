The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests a potential fit for the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also benchmarks its approach on two challenging face detection databases, which could potentially fit under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of low-resolution images and strong illumination variations, which could potentially fit under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
