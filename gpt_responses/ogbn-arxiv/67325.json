The paper proposes a novel approach for solving this problem using SVMs, which is a popular machine learning algorithm. The paper also focuses on scalability, which is an important issue in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
