The paper also discusses cryptographic operations and secrets, which are relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of state-machine replication and consensus protocols suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also deals with randomness generation and verifiable random functions, which are topics that are relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
