The use of graph-based representation and external knowledge sources suggests a focus on information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), which are subfields of computer science that fall under cs.IR and cs.CL. The use of deep learning models such as BiLSTM and CNN suggests a focus on machine learning (ML), which falls under cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.DL.
