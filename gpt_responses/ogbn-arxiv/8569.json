This involves building random walks connecting together partial walks previously computed at each network node. The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic structures like Bloom filters to reduce unnecessary hops. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), social and information networks (cs.SI), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information theory (cs.IT). However, given the focus on network search algorithms and data structures, cs.DS is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.SI and cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
