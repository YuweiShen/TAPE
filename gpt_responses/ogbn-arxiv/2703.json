The use of likelihood ascent search (LAS) algorithms and linear complexity also suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the proposed quasi LRS-CDMA approach may involve signal processing and optimization techniques, which could relate to the sub-category of signal and image processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
