This involves training a parameter distribution via a variational lower bound and adapting via a stochastic procedure. The paper's focus on meta-learning, few-shot learning, and probabilistic modeling suggests that it is most likely to belong to the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
