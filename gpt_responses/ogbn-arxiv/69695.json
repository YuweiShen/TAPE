This involves the use of a neural network and algorithms such as A* search and Monte Carlo tree search. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques and a neural network to teach an agent to manage a portfolio. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method that combines deep reinforcement learning techniques with search techniques to optimize a non-differentiable utility function. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a new algorithm named A* tree search that combines A* search and Monte Carlo tree search. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper involves the development of a trading system that uses the proposed method. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for managing a portfolio, which can be seen as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
