This approach is significantly different from the well-known representation learning models with extremely deep structures. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
