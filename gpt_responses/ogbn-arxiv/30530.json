Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Computer Algebra). The paper also involves computations with matrices, so it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of automorphisms and derivations suggests a connection to control theory, so cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a possibility. Finally, the paper involves complexity analysis and explicit bounds, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
