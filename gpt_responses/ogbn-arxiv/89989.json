The model uses a target-aware hierarchical attention mechanism to attend to the most important clinical records when aggregating their representations for prediction of a diagnosis. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), cybernetics (cs.CY), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
