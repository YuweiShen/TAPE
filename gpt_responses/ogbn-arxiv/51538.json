It focuses on achieving high-performance multi-pathing and load balancing, and proposes a redesigned transport layer based on recent advances in data center networking. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
