The paper also proposes a new method (Exact Label Learning) for creating training graphs that explicitly code the desired label. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves some theoretical analysis, which suggests the possibility of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SD (Sound) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
