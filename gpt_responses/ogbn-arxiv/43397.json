Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions applications of temporal graphs in modern systems and applications, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the differences between static and temporal graphs, which could place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
