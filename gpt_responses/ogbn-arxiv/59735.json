This is a key area of research in social and information networks.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a modified version of single linkage clustering and discusses algorithms for hierarchical quasi-clustering. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Clustering is a common technique in machine learning and the paper proposes a new method for clustering asymmetric networks.\n4. cs.SD (Software Development) - The paper discusses the development of algorithms for hierarchical quasi-clustering, which falls under the domain of software development.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the stability and invariance properties of the proposed method, which are concepts commonly studied in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
