The paper also focuses on improving AI tools by incorporating SE knowledge, which suggests a connection to the cs.AI sub-category. The experiments reported in the paper involve a variant of the LIME explanation algorithm, which is a machine learning (ML) technique, indicating a connection to the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of careful use of off-the-shelf AI tools, which suggests a connection to the cs.CR sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of static code attributes, which suggests a connection to the cs.PL sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
