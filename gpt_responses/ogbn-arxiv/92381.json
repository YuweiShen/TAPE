This falls under the category of networked and internet technologies (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the modelling of the channel as a binary symmetric channel and a packet erasure channel, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also deals with the issue of corrupted frames and CRC errors, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper uses measurements taken in an outdoor environment, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for network throughput gains, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
