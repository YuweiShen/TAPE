The use of sparse modeling is a common technique in computer vision and machine learning, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with functional representation, which is a topic in computer graphics, suggesting that it could belong to cs.GR (Computer Graphics). Additionally, the paper proposes a robust variant capable of handling incomplete matches, which is a problem in artificial intelligence, suggesting that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed methods on standard benchmarks containing both synthetic and scanned objects, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
