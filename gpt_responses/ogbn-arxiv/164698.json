This involves developing a model of human navigation and decision-making, using inverse reinforcement learning, and implementing a planner that generates communicative actions to maximize transparency and efficiency. The paper also includes a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
