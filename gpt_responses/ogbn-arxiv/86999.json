It may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category as it introduces a SAT encoding for planning. The paper also deals with logic and temporal planning, making it relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) category. Additionally, the paper involves empirical comparisons of different planners, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Data Mining (cs.DM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
