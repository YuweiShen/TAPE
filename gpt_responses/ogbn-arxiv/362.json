The paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation technique that creates and leverages a rough labeling on the test samples. This technique involves learning a transformation that aligns the source and target samples. The paper also experiments with the proposed technique on simulated and real data. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
