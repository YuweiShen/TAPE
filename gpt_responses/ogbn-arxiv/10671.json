The paper also discusses linear codes over a base field, which falls under the category of coding theory (cs.SI). The repair bandwidth is a measure of communication, which is a topic in networking (cs.NI) and the paper mentions the cut-set bound, which is a concept in network coding (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
