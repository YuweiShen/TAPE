This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR), as uplift modeling is often used in marketing and customer retention. Additionally, the paper proposes a new metric for learning-to-rank called promoted cumulative gain (PCG), which could also fall under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE). The use of LambdaMART, a gradient boosting algorithm, suggests a focus on data science (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
