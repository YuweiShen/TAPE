The paper proposes a meta-algorithm that can be used with any batch RL or online learning procedure, which falls under the category of machine learning. The paper also discusses the problem of mediating among different competing objectives and constraints, which is a common problem in robotics and control systems, falling under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper presents empirical results on a simulated car driving problem, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Overall, the paper is likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
