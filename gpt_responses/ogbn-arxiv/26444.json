This involves exploring sampling strategies and NN choices, which are key components of computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper employs a learning-based planner that decides the sampling action at runtime, which is a machine learning technique. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's focus on developing an autonomous camera system that can perform analytics is closely related to the field of AI. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses error estimation and bounding, which are important topics in information retrieval. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper explores the joint tradeoff from both sampling strategy and wide selection of NN choices, which is related to neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
