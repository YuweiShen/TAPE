Specifically, it proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework to extract actions from texts without any restricted templates or prior knowledge of the candidate set of actions. This work involves techniques from computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
