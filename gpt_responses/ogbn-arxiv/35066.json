This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision sub-category.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial examples, which is a security concern. The proposed method also involves data hiding, which is a technique used in cryptography. Therefore, cs.CR is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks and proposes a method to construct adversarial examples. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the vulnerability of machine learning models and proposes a method to construct adversarial examples. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed method involves reversible data hiding, which is a technique used in multimedia applications such as image and video watermarking.
