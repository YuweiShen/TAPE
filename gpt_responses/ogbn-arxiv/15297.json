Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely categories. The paper also uses BERT, which is a popular deep learning model for NLP, indicating that cs.AI is also a likely category. The paper proposes a new approach for modeling conversation history, which is a key aspect of conversational search, suggesting that cs.LG may also be a relevant category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of different numbers of history turns, which could be considered a computational complexity issue, making cs.CC a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
