The use of text and images for translation suggests that it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of neural networks for translation suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of a zero-resource approach suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
