This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the data structures (cs.DS) or computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves optimization of space and construction time, which could also place it in the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the graph theory (cs.GT) sub-category due to its focus on reachability in digraphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
