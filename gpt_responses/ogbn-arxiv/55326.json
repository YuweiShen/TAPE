It involves the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels and the computation of signal-to-noise ratio exponents. These topics are closely related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networked systems (cs.NI), optimization and control (cs.OH), systems and control (cs.SY), and physics (cs.PHYS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
