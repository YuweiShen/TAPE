The paper proposes a new algorithm called eager-SGD that uses partial collectives to relax global synchronization and improve training efficiency. The paper also provides theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the proposed algorithm. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
