This involves using techniques such as co-read vectors and spectral density of the co-read network. These techniques are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR), social networks (cs.SI), data mining (cs.SD), machine learning (cs.DL), and systems and control (cs.SY). However, given the focus on analyzing scholarly literature and identifying communities within it, we believe cs.IR is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.SI and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
