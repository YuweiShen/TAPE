Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves challenges in database and query, which suggests the possibility of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The proposed system produces reliable confidence scores, which may relate to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
