The paper specifically focuses on enhancing the method of moments for resolving the non-convex issue in learning latent GMs. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning, which is cs.LG. Additionally, the paper also introduces novel concepts of marginalization and conditioning, which are relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also deals with the problem of learning a larger GM from a smaller one, which is relevant to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper covers a broad class of loopy latent GMs, which is relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
