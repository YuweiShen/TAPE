The use of MDS codes in the storage system suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CR), distributed computing (cs.DC), and computer networks (cs.CC). The focus on minimizing implementation complexity suggests a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
