Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to obtaining non-vacuous bounds using PAC-Bayes bounds optimized using variational inference (VI), which is a common technique in machine learning.\n\nThe paper also touches upon topics related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the problem of generalization in neural networks, which is a fundamental problem in AI. Furthermore, the paper investigates the failure of VI, which is a common technique in AI research.\n\nThe paper also discusses topics related to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it mentions benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision research, such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.\n\nThe paper also touches upon topics related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with the problem of overparametrization in neural networks, which is a common topic in NE research.\n\nFinally, the paper discusses topics related to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it mentions PAC-Bayes bounds, which are a type of information-theoretic bound commonly used in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
