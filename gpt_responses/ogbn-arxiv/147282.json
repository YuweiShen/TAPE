Additionally, the paper mentions communication models characterized by adaptiveness and flexibility, which are often studied in the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also proposes a formalism for verifying the robustness of these systems, which falls under the formal methods (cs.LO) sub-category.
