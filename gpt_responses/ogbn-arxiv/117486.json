However, based on the abstract and title, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. The paper also involves the study of wireless networks (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), and communication engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the mention of coherence time and block fading suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
