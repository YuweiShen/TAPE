The paper also proposes a novel method that utilizes domain knowledge and feature attentive selection, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the deployment of the proposed method in a self-developed autonomous driving car, indicating that it may also fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
