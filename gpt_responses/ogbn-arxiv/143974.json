The introduction of spillback in the deterministic queuing model involves the study of system dynamics (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the algorithmic aspects of computing dynamic equilibria, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
