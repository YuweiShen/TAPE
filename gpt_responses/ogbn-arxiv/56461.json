The paper also discusses alignment and fusion of observations, which are common tasks in computer vision (cs.CV). The algorithmic framework presented in the paper leverages insights from the multi-way matching and spectral graph clustering literature, which are topics commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency and scalability of the algorithm, which are topics commonly studied in the field of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
