This involves analyzing the signal-to-noise ratio and ergodic capacity of the system, as well as proposing a phase noise tracking algorithm. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. \n\nThe paper also involves analyzing the system performance and proposing a tracking algorithm, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nAdditionally, the paper deals with massive MIMO systems, which falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves analyzing the performance of a communication system, which falls under the sub-category of cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
