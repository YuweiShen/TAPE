The use of fixed rate codes and complex signal constellations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The consideration of fading dynamics and the use of OFDM techniques make the paper relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the focus on throughput, diversity, and delay tradeoffs in the context of ARQ protocols suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Communications (cs.COMM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
