The paper also discusses the use of near-data processing (NDP) to improve compaction, which is a topic that falls under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and operating systems (cs.OS). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to optimizing key-value stores, which could be considered a systems-level contribution and thus falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
