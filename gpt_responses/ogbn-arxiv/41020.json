The proposed approach relies on a component-wise time series prediction model based on Statistical Recurrent Units (SRUs), which is a type of recurrent neural network. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), signal processing (cs.SI), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
