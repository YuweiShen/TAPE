This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves the study of graph embeddings and geometric algorithms, which are topics covered in computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of lower bounds and asymptotic analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to theoretical computer science (cs.GT) and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
