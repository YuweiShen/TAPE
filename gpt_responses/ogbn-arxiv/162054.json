The use of prior distributions on model parameters is also a common technique in Bayesian machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing techniques to extract information from knowledge graphs (cs.CL). The use of knowledge graphs also suggests a potential application in database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses the improvement of generalization capability, which is a common topic in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
