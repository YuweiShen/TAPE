This involves the use of multi-view models and learning capabilities to improve the quality and reusability of the reference model. This topic is closely related to software engineering (cs.SE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and software systems (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of programming languages (cs.PL) in the implementation of the proposed framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
