The application of the procedure is demonstrated in the context of deep brain stimulation, which falls under the category of bioinformatics (cs.BIO). The paper also mentions the potential use of the methodology in robotic guidance, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the computational expense of the simulation, which could be relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
