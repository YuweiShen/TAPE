This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper proposes a new approach that utilizes dictionary learning for robust photometric stereo. This involves using adaptive dictionary regularization to remove noise and other non-idealities from the image dataset before estimating the normal vectors. This approach involves machine learning techniques, specifically dictionary learning, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of gradient dictionaries, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques to estimate the normal vectors, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
