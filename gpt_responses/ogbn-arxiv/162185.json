The use of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes and maximum rank distance (MRD) Gabidulin block codes suggests a focus on coding theory (cs.CR) and algebraic coding theory (cs.DS). The consideration of streaming sources and packet erasure channels may also suggest a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
