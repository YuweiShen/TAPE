Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also leverages geometric relationships among planes, which suggests that it could belong to cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.RO (Robotics). The use of energy minimization and constraint models indicates that the paper could also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
