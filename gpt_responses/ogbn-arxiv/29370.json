The paper proposes a locally orthogonal training sequence design based on graph coloring, which reduces the overhead of assigning orthogonal training sequences to all users. This problem involves concepts from information theory (cs.IT), networking (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), graph theory (cs.DS), and game theory (cs.GT). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
