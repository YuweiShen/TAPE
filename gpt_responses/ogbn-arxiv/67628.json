Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The proposed method involves feature extraction and sequence learning, which are also relevant to machine learning (LG) and information retrieval (IR). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to tackle the challenges of irregular text recognition, which requires innovative solutions and can be related to artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
