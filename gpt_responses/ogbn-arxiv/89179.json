This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of eye-tracking in real-world scenarios, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the use of probability distribution for refinement can be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
