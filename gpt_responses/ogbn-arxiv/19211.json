This involves leveraging information extracted from a source platform to solve tasks in another platform with less domain-related content. The paper uses transfer representation learning and word embeddings to achieve this. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are: \n\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with extracting knowledge from different platforms, which is a core problem in information retrieval. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses word embeddings, which is a popular technique in natural language processing. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with analyzing knowledge across different social media platforms. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper focuses on improving knowledge extraction tasks in software development. \n- cs.SD (Sound): This is a less likely category, but the paper does mention analyzing YouTube comments, which could involve analyzing audio content."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
