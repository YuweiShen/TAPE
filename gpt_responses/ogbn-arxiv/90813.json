Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses neural models to extract author context, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also experiments with different datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with the perception of sarcasm, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
