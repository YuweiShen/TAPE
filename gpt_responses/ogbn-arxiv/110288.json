The paper proposes a new two-stage detector that is faster and more accurate than existing methods, which involves designing a new architecture for the network. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the focus on speed and accuracy in object detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
