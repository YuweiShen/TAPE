The method involves the use of bidirectional long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to learn the periodic brain status changes and fuse them to form the final output. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL) in terms of analyzing brain functional connectivity data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
