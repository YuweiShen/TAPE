The use of game theory to model the decision making process also supports this category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Autonomous vehicles are a key application of AI, and the paper discusses the use of Nash equilibrium, a concept from game theory, to model decision making. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics) - Autonomous vehicles are a type of robot, and the paper deals with their decision making process. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the control input of autonomous vehicles, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it is possible that the autonomous vehicles use some form of machine learning to make decisions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
