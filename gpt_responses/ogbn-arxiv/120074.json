The use of progressive networks for transfer learning also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sparse rewards and the potential for compositional approaches, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
