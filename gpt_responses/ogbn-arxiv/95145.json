The proposed framework and algorithms are based on statistical and algebraic methods, which are typical of the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions tensor methods, which are commonly used in data science (cs.DS) and computer vision (cs.CV) for analyzing high-dimensional data. Finally, the paper discusses the sample complexity of the proposed methods, which is related to the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
