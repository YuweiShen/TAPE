This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper addresses communication overhead, which is a common issue in distributed computing, indicating that it could also belong to the sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The proposed methods involve sampling and quantile summary, which are techniques used in data analysis and statistics, suggesting that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance in production environments, which could indicate that it belongs to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of GBDT in computer vision, which could suggest that it belongs to the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
