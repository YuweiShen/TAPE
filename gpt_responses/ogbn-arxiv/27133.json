The paper also proposes a new method for adaptive distillation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning models for object detection also falls under the category of deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) where efficient algorithms are crucial for real-time applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
