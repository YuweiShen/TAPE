It could also belong to \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) as credit attribution is an important task in this field. The use of neural networks and attention mechanisms suggests that it could also belong to \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) and \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of distant-supervision and multilabel classification could also make it relevant to \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
