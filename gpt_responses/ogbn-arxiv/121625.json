The paper also proposes a suboptimal user ordering algorithm to achieve a more practical performance-complexity tradeoff, which falls under the category of network optimization (cs.NI) and system optimization (cs.SI). The paper also deals with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the allocation of inter-channel-interference, which is a topic related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
