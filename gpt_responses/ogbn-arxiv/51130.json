This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and optics (cs.OH), as well as networked systems (cs.NI) and physics (cs.PH) due to the use of fiber optics. Additionally, the paper involves numerical optimization and analysis of pulse duration and bandwidth, which falls under signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
