Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of a Multilingual-BERT model, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The fine-tuning of the model and the evaluation of the QA systems involve machine learning techniques, which could also place the paper under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) as it involves retrieving answers from a given text, which could place it under cs.IR. Finally, the paper involves the use of language resources and tools, which could place it under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
