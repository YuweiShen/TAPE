The proposed system uses computer vision techniques such as Feature Pyramid Network and ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (SHDL) network for human pose estimation and identification of violent individuals. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a new dataset for aerial surveillance, which indicates that it may belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well. The use of deep learning techniques and cloud processing for real-time surveillance may also suggest that it belongs to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the application of the proposed system for law enforcement purposes may indicate that it belongs to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
