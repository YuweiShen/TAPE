The paper also focuses on improving performance in small-data regimes, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed approach is evaluated on various datasets and network architectures, indicating that it could be relevant to a broad range of machine learning applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
