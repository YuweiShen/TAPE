This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses techniques for reducing the bandwidth required for tracking per-line reuse state in DRAM caches. This could be relevant to distributed and parallel computing systems that use DRAM caches.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a replacement/bypass policy called RRIP Age-On-Bypass (RRIP-AOB) that tracks reuse state for high-reuse lines and Ages the state On cache Bypass. This could be relevant to systems and control applications that require efficient cache replacement policies.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper evaluates the proposed techniques using a 2GB DRAM cache and reports a speedup of 18%. This could be relevant to computational engineering and science applications that require efficient memory systems.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper proposes techniques for improving the hit-rate of DRAM caches, which is directly related to performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
