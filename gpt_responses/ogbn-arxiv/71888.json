The proposed method involves real-time processing of phasor measurement units (PMUs) data. This work involves the application of machine learning techniques to power systems, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves the development of a novel oscillation diagnosis method, which involves the use of data-driven techniques such as statistical analysis and machine learning, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves the application of software engineering principles to develop the proposed method, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper involves the application of electrical engineering principles to power systems, which falls under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
