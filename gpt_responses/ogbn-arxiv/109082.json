The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in multimedia processing, suggesting that it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category.
