The paper discusses how to learn functionally salient representations that are useful for decision making, which is a common problem in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses how these representations can be used for downstream tasks, which suggests a possible connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the downstream tasks involve control or vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
