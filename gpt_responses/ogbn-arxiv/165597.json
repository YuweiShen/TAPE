This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to sparsify the CSI vector, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) matrix, which is a statistical signal processing technique, and thus falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of spectral efficiency, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
