This involves the use of supervised learning algorithms to train the SNN, which is a common topic in the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the recognition of hand gestures involves image processing, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of surrogate gradient descent learning algorithm is a machine learning technique, which is also relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the recognition of hand gestures using DVS cameras has applications in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
