The paper also uses a large-scale captured training set with MPI-corrupted depth to train the encoder and a smaller synthetic training set with ground truth depth to train the decoder stage of the network. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper uses a physically-based, time-resolved renderer to generate synthetic scenes for training the decoder stage of the network. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of ToF imaging for depth estimation, which is relevant to robotics applications. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of ToF imaging for depth estimation, which is relevant to multimedia applications such as augmented reality and virtual reality. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new technique to correct errors in depth using a convolutional neural network, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
