The paper also proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm for joint design of transmit beamforming matrix and phase shift matrix, which involves optimization and learning, and thus can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The use of RIS also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions simulation results, which suggests the use of multimedia (cs.MM) for visualization and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
