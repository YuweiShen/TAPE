The paper also uses information-theoretic tools such as divergence and mutual information to derive lower bounds on the distortion. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper considers the problem of estimation with the assistance of a cost-constrained helper, which can be seen as a networked system. The paper also discusses the case where the desired signal is available at the helper, which is a relevant problem in social and information networks. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper presents a general achievable scheme for discrete memoryless systems, which can be seen as a learning algorithm. The paper also discusses the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by interference, which is a relevant problem in machine learning. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by interference, which is a relevant problem in multimedia applications such as image and video processing. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper considers the problem of estimation with the assistance of a cost-constrained helper, which can be seen as a networking problem. The paper also discusses the case where the desired signal is available at the helper, which is a relevant problem in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
