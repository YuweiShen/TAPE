The use of mobile agents and the focus on their motion rules suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-category of \"Multiagent Systems\" (cs.MA). The fact that the agents have limited visibility and sensing capabilities, and that the paper proposes a solution based on geometrical considerations, suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of \"Robotics\" (cs.RO) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY). The use of a simple rule of motion and the focus on the convergence of the agents to a common meeting point suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
