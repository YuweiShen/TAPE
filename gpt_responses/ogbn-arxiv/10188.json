Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Security (cs.CR) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning website profiles, which suggests that it could also be classified under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions a dataset for visual phishing detection, which could place it under Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
