It also proposes an alternative approach for approximate evaluation of conjunctive queries, which involves ranking methods from graphs to hypergraphs (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the algorithm used for enumeration of necessary plans, which involves optimization techniques (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides a detailed experimental evaluation of the approach, which involves data analysis and modeling (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
