Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the allocation of channels and the coordination of interference, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a tailored algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
