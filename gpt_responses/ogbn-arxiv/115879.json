The use of approximation ratios and the focus on finding a largest stable matching suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the theory of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the consideration of strategy-proofness against coalitions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
