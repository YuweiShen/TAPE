The paper also discusses the use of learning heuristics and the incentives for players to adopt them, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The concept of strategic teaching is also a key aspect of the paper, which could fall under the subfield of social influence (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical proofs and analysis, which could be relevant to the subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
