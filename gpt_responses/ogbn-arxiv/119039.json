This falls under the domain of software engineering (cs.SE) and computer engineering (cs.CE) as it involves designing and implementing software systems to control the technical functions of buildings. The platform also involves monitoring and measuring energy efficiency over time, which falls under the domain of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the platform uses a domain-specific language to describe the functional requirements of the building services, which could involve artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
