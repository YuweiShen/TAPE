Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a regularization method based on group Lasso, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method to machine question answering, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the extension of the proposed method to non-LSTM RNNs, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) if applied to image or video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
