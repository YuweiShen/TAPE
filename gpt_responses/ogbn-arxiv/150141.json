The paper also mentions the use of packet splitting to shape traffic, which is a technique commonly used in distributed computing (cs.DC) and system engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the system using commodity hardware, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) as it involves optimizing the performance of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
