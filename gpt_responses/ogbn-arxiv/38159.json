The use of oracles to access the unknown distribution is a common technique in data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM), which are also relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of the models, which is a topic that falls under computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
