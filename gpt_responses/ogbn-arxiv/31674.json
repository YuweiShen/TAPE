The paper also discusses the robustness of watermarking methods against different attacks, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of neural networks for determining the appropriate embedding strength factor suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
