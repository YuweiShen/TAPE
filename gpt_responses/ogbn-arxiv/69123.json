This falls under the scope of computer algebra systems (CAS), which is a subfield of computer science. Therefore, cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of algorithms and data structures for efficient computation, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). \n\nThe problem of canonicalization involves symmetry, which could be related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and the Butler-Portugal algorithm used in the paper is related to group theory, which could be related to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
