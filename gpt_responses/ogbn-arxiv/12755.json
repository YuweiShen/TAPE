The use of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a common technique in signal processing (cs.MM) and the paper also discusses the capacity region of a strong interference channel (cs.SI) with common message. Finally, the paper deals with the concept of block length, which is relevant to network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
