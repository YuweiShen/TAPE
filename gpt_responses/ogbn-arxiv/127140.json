The paper also models the problem as a nontransferable coalitional game, which is a topic related to game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper proposes distributed algorithms for coalition formation, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes simulation results, which may fall under multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves visualizing and analyzing data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
