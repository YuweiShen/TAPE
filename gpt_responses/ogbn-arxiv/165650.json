It may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it discusses scheduling decisions and partitioning of work. Additionally, it could be categorized under Databases (cs.DB) as it discusses large scale data analytics applications. Machine learning is also mentioned, which could place it under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
