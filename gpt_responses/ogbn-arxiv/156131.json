The focus is on memory constraints, which is a common issue in practical applications of bandit algorithms. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves information theory and control theory concepts, which suggest the categories cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
