However, the paper also mentions applications to poaching and burglary prevention, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category as well. The paper also involves metric spaces and quadratic objectives, which are topics commonly studied in the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories.
