The paper proposes a gradient-based IRL approach that simultaneously estimates the system's dynamics, which involves optimization and control theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also deals with Markov Decision Processes (MDP), which is a subfield of control theory and optimization, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves data analysis and statistical modeling, which makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
