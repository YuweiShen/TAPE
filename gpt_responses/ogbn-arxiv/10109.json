While this paper does not directly address computational complexity, it does discuss the complexity of design problems and the need for coordination processes to manage task interdependencies, which could be seen as a form of complexity. \n\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. While this paper does not focus on software specifically, it does discuss the collaborative design process, which could be relevant to software engineering teams. \n\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category deals with the study of how people interact with computers and technology. This paper discusses the importance of managing multiple perspectives in design, which could be relevant to HCI researchers interested in understanding how to design technology that meets the needs of diverse users. \n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category deals with the social and ethical implications of computing. While this paper does not directly address social or ethical issues, it does discuss the importance of managing multiple perspectives in design, which could be relevant to researchers interested in understanding how to design technology that is inclusive and equitable. \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the study of social networks and the flow of information within them.
