This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.QI (Quantum Physics), as it deals with the complexity of quantum algorithms. Additionally, the paper involves the use of polynomial-time computable functions, which suggests a possible connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the mathematical definition of the new class, which could also be relevant to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
