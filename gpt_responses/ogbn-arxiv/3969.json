The paper presents a comprehensive list of all string matching algorithms and provides experimental results to compare them from a practical point of view. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Data Mining (cs.DM), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), and Computational Geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
