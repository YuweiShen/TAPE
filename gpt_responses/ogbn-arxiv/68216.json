The proposed method involves score level and decision level fusion, which are techniques used in machine learning (cs.MM) and pattern recognition (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of iris and fingerprint modalities, which are commonly studied in computer vision and biometrics (cs.CV and cs.IR). Finally, the paper addresses privacy concerns, which are relevant to the field of cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
