Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a scoring function for selecting informative question-image pairs, which involves machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Neural Networks (cs.AI) and expected error reduction (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach using query savings and performance metrics, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
