Specifically, it focuses on the performance gap between LSTM-CTC based systems and hybrid DNNs based systems on domains with limited data. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. Other likely sub-categories include cs.SD (Sound), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as these sub-categories also cover topics related to neural networks and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
