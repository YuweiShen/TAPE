This problem involves processing large amounts of data and making predictions based on it, which suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DB (databases) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions that the predictions are used to narrow down suspicious edits for human revision, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. The paper also mentions that the predictions are based on features extracted from the data, which suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.SI (information systems) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper deals with natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CL (computation and language) sub-category.
