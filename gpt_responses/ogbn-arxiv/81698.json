This involves the use of statistical models and algorithms to reconstruct the phylogeny and genotype of subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. The paper uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees to group SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimate the number of lineages and their ancestry. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computational biology (cs.CE), databases (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
