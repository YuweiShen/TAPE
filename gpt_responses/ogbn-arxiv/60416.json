This work is primarily focused on improving the efficiency of CNNs, which is a common topic in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. Additionally, the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the optimization of CNN architecture is related to the field of software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
