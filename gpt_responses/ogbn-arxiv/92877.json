Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of edges and landmark points, which are common in graphics and visualization, suggesting cs.GR (Graphics) as the second likely sub-category. The use of a morphable model involves manipulating 3D shapes, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which are common in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach that relies on explicit hard correspondences, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
