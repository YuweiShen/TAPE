The numerical experiments involve solving linear transport and Burgers' equation in 2D. \n2. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a new finite element scheme for solving scalar conservation laws and discusses its implementation. \n3. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper involves the development of a nonlinear stabilization technique based on a graph-Laplacian operator, which may involve symbolic computations. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a numerical method for solving partial differential equations, which is relevant to computational engineering and science. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although less likely, the paper's use of a graph-Laplacian operator may also be relevant to social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
