This involves optimizing both the reward and some auxiliary cost that discourages undesired control. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of Lagrangian relaxation, which is a common optimization technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses benchmark tasks and real robot experiments, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
