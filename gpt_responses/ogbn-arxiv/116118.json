It is also likely to belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) because it deals with mechanisms for semantic parsing, which is a key task in natural language processing. The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) because it discusses the capacity of neural systems for semantic parsing.
