The paper specifically focuses on coinductive proof search and proof construction in Horn clause logic, which is a subfield of logic programming. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other likely sub-categories include cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), as these subfields are closely related to logic programming and coinductive proof search."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
