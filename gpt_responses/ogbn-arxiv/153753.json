The paper proposes a new prior for blind deconvolution based on sparsity and spectral flatness, and provides an iterative algorithm that achieves guaranteed performance. This problem is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and statistical inference (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
