The paper focuses on feature embedding and introduces a locality preserving loss to encourage the student network to generate low-dimensional features that inherit intrinsic properties of their corresponding high-dimensional features from the teacher network. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper is primarily about optimizing a machine learning model using knowledge distillation and feature embedding.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision applications.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of knowledge distillation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the use of neural networks and their optimization.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
