The paper presents a novel open-domain IR system that uses information extracted from the Common Crawl to argumentatively compare objects. This involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in the fields of information retrieval (cs.IR), computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and deep learning (cs.DL). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
