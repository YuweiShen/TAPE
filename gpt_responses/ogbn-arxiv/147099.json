The paper also involves graph structures and algorithms for recovering information from pairwise measurements, which are common topics in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses applications of the theory to the Stochastic Block Model and the Haplotype Assembly Problem, which are topics in Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Data Mining (cs.DM), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
