The use of Channel State Information (CSI) and the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the secrecy capacity suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the study of the upper bound on the secrecy capacity for the correlated Rayleigh wiretap channel may also relate to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM), as it involves the analysis of wireless communication channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
