This involves deep learning techniques for natural language processing and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). However, the paper also involves text embeddings and semantic knowledge, which suggests it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper involves multimodal learning, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) and the use of deep learning techniques suggests it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
