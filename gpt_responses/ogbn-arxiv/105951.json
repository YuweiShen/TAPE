The use of random matrix theory suggests that the paper may be related to information theory (cs.IT) or machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on robustness suggests that the paper may also be related to statistics (cs.ST) or mathematical statistics (cs.MS). Finally, the use of spectral norm and the large dimensional regime suggest that the paper may be related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
