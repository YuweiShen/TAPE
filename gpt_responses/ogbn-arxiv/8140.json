The paper also provides a careful analysis of the iterative Frank-Wolfe algorithm adapted to this context, which is a technique used in optimization and numerical analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also involves statistical analysis, so cs.ST (Statistics) is a likely sub-category, and the use of optimization techniques suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
