The main focus is on the development of a deep-neural-network-based surrogate model for predicting engine parameters of interest. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of a parallel, fast, robust, physics-based reduced-order engine simulator, which suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of machine learning for engine calibration also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
