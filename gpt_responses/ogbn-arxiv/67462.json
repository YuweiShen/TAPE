The paper also discusses the impact of antenna design and terminal housing on the beam codebook, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel and efficient data-driven method for generating the beam codebook, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques, and hence can be classified under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
