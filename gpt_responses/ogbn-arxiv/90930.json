The use of Error Correcting Output Coding (ECOC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) also suggests that this paper may fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the use of ensemble methods and feature selection may also indicate a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
