It also involves computational complexity (cs.CC) in terms of defining a tileset whose assembly is locally determined, and computational geometry (cs.CG) in terms of constructing the fractal. The paper also discusses the use of an infinite coding sequence, which relates to systems and control theory (cs.SY), and the concept of almost-everywhere local determinism, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
