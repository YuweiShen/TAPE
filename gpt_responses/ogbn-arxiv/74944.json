It also proposes a novel loss function for improved zero-shot learning, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is based on deep learning, which is a popular subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with semantic understanding and language concepts, which are relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the experiments are conducted on image datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
