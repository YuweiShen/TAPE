Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of hyperparameters on robustness, which could be considered under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study of compensating for computational failures could also be relevant to the category of robotics (cs.RO) or systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the discussion of energy efficiency could be relevant to the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
