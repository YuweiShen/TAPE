The paper proposes a method to extend the reorientation capability of a pick-and-place regrasp by adding a vertical pin on the working surface and using it as the intermediate location for regrasping. This clearly falls under the domain of robotics.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, but it is likely that vision-based perception is used to detect the objects and the support pins in the environment. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method that automatically computes the stable placements of an object leaning against a vertical pin, finds several force-closure grasps, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and searches for the regrasp sequence. These tasks involve AI techniques such as planning, optimization, and search. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not mention any machine learning techniques, but it is possible that machine learning is used to learn the grasping and regrasping policies. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for sequential robotic manipulation, which involves controlling the robot's motion and grasping actions. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
