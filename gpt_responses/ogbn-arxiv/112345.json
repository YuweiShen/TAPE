This involves learning to classify instances involving both seen and unseen classes, which is a problem commonly addressed in machine learning and computer vision (cs.LG, cs.CV). The method also involves leveraging prior knowledge and relationships between classes, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on public benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
