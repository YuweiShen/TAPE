The use of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as STL is a formal language used for specifying properties of dynamical systems. The application of the proposed approach to the congestion avoidance problem in a traffic network also suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
