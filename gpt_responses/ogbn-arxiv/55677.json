The use of cut dimension of a graph to derive a lower bound suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study of submodular functions has applications in various fields, including social networks and recommendation systems, which could place the paper in the social and information networks (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
