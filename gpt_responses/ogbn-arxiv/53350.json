The paper also discusses the metric properties of codes, which falls under Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper applies the theory of MacWilliams identities to enumerative combinatorics problems, which is a topic in Combinatorial Computing (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
