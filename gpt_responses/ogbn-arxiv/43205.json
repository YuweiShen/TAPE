This involves designing a system to manage the distribution of power in a network, which falls under the Systems and Control category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel data-driven probability efficient point (PEP) method to account for the VRE uncertainties and compute the optimal total VRE generation at different confidence (risk) levels. This involves the use of machine learning techniques to optimize the VRE generation, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence category. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a transactive day-ahead market model that involves distributed energy resources (DERs) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This involves designing a system to manage the distribution of power across multiple nodes, which falls under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing category. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a DLMP-based transactive day-ahead market model, which involves designing software to manage the distribution of power in a network. This falls under the Software Engineering category. \n- cs.ETM (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a DLMP-based transactive day"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
