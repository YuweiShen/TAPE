Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The proposed framework also involves reinforcement learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), suggesting cs.LG and cs.AI as likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework on a large online academic search system, indicating a potential relevance to database (cs.DB) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
