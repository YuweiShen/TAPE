It could also belong to cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) as the term \"cascade\" is often used in the context of music information retrieval. Additionally, the use of deep learning techniques such as attention mechanism and convolutional network suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on predicting cascade-level properties in a general setting suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
