This is a common problem in robotics where different camera configurations may be used for different tasks. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper proposes modifications to the visual front-end of SLAM systems, which is a core component of computer vision. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an information-theoretic keyframe selection algorithm, which is a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an adaptive initialization scheme and a scalable voxel-based map, which are AI techniques. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes modifications to a state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry system, which is a control system used in robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
