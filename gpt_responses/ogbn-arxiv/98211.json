This involves the use of antenna arrays and uplink reference signals, which are relevant to the fields of networked sensing and information theory (cs.NI, cs.IT). The paper also addresses clock synchronization between devices, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed solutions using a realistic network setup and propagation modeling, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
