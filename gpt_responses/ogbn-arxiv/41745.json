The use of block-Markov coding scheme suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) or data structures (cs.DS). The analysis of resolvability rates also involves the study of dependencies and causality, which could be relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
