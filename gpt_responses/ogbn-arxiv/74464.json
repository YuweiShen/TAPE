Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on the Broadcast Channel with Cognitive Relays (BCCR), which falls under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of directed graphs for illustrating the achievability design, which could potentially fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper's use of coding schemes and rate splitting could also potentially fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the mention of extending the proposed scheme to other communication networks could potentially fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
