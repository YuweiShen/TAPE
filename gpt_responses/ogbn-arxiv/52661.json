The use of geometric bumps and dents on the edges of tiles suggests a focus on Computational Geometry (cs.CG). The mention of algorithmic behavior and simulation of complex glue functions suggests a connection to the sub-categories of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
