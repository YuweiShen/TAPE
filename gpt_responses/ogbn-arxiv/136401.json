The paper also discusses the use of genie-aided arguments, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI). The topic of multi-way communications is also relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper may also be relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE) as it deals with the practical implementation of communication systems. Finally, the paper may touch upon multimedia systems (cs.MM) as it discusses the transmission of messages between multiple users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
