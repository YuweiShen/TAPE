This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which suggests that cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses finding optimal policies and transferring knowledge across similar problems, which are topics that fall under the categories of reinforcement learning (cs.LG), decision making (cs.DS), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
