The paper also discusses the impact of interference on the degrees of freedom and power levels of the transmitters, which could be relevant to the networked information (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper specifically focuses on the MAC-IC-MAC, which is a specific type of multiple access channel, making the multi-agent systems (cs.MM) sub-category a likely fit.
