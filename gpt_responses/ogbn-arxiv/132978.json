The use of topological descriptors and persistence diagrams also suggests a connection to computational topology (cs.DM). The reconstruction of plane graphs is a problem in graph theory (cs.GR), and the specific arrangements of vertices that create problems for reconstruction may be related to computational geometry (cs.CG) or computational topology (cs.DM). Finally, the paper's focus on plane graphs without degree two vertices may be relevant to structural informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
