The focus on visualization and transparency also suggests a potential fit for Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI). The use of planning components in a smart assistant for an instrumented meeting space could also relate to Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of model-based visualization suggests a possible connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
