The proposed models include regularized multi-task ordinal regression models and deep neural network-based multi-task ordinal regression models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
