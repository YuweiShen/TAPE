Specifically, the method involves constructing a matrix-variate normal prior on weights, which is a statistical approach that is often used in machine learning and falls under the category of \"Statistics\" in computer science. The paper also presents empirical results on multiclass classification and multitask regression problems, which are common applications of neural networks and fall under the categories of \"Computer Vision\" (cs.CV) and \"Natural Language Processing\" (cs.NE) in computer science. Finally, the paper discusses the properties of the proposed method, such as stable ranks and spectral norms, which are related to the structure and behavior of neural networks and fall under the category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
