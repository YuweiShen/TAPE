The paper also mentions taking into account kinematic constraints, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of solvers and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper presents results in simulation and on real robots, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) for the purposes of training and testing the algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
