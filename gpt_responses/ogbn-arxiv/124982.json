The proposed method is based on a constrained quadratic program (CQP) formulation utilizing an adaptive quantization thresholding approach, which involves optimization techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also mentions the recovery of time-varying parameters, which falls under the category of system identification (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
