This task is highly relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a unified framework that uses grounded evidence to answer questions, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.AI) and probabilistic modeling (cs.LG). Finally, the paper uses the TVQA+ dataset, which involves object detection and tracking in videos (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
