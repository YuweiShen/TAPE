Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a self-supervision constraint for directed map networks, which is relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with optimization of map networks, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
