Game theory is often used to analyze auction mechanisms and strategies of participants. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with online advertising and the auctioning of ad slots. Information retrieval techniques may be used to match ads with relevant content or users. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper devises algorithms for scheduling advertisers with budget and impression constraints. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper involves multiple agents such as the auctioneer, intermediaries, and advertisers. Multi-agent systems are often used to model interactions between agents in complex systems. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions different types of ad slots such as video and banner ads.
