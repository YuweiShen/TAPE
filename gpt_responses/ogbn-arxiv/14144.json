The paper discusses the application of the indicator to more than 10,000 journals, which suggests a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The weighting scheme used in the indicator involves percentile classes, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides a template for statistical tests, which suggests a focus on cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
