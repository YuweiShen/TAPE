The paper also proposes a new method for conditional independence tests using conditional correlation independence (CCI), which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and statistics (cs.ST). The paper also mentions the use of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), which is a common tool in neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
