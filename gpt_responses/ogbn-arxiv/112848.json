Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses machine learning models and word embeddings, which are related to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of comparable corpora and annotation projection is related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the focus on named entities makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
