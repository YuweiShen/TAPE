This involves algorithms and computational complexity, which suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the complexity of decision problems on a generalization of the games, which involves analyzing the structure of the game and finding efficient algorithms to solve them.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper proves NP-hardness for 2048 by reducing from 3SAT, which is a classic problem in computational complexity. This suggests that the paper could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses popular games like 2048 and Threes, which are often used as benchmarks for AI algorithms. The paper could be relevant to researchers working on game AI and decision-making.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper involves analyzing the structure of the game board and finding efficient algorithms to slide and merge tiles. This could be relevant to researchers working on computational geometry and optimization problems.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper involves analyzing the complexity of decision problems in games, which is a classic topic in game theory. The paper could be relevant to researchers working on game theory and algorithmic game theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
