The application of this method to the problem of defining declarative policies for reactive agents and reasoning about them suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the use of abstraction to reduce the size of the problem is a technique that can be applied to many areas of computer science, including mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
