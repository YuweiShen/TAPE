The proposed framework is based on a principled problem formulation and uses a novel approach to handle overlapping triples. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
