The paper proposes a new technique based on black box optimization using human perception as a fitness function. This technique is evaluated on several benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision and machine learning research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with the security of deep neural networks, it could also be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
