This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to cuckoo hashing that involves multiple cell choices on a single page and a backup page, which could be relevant to the Databases (cs.DB) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. The paper also presents experimental results and suggests new theoretical questions, which could be relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
