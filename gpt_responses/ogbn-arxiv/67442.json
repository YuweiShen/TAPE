This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves adding task-dependent memory units, which suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. The experiments are conducted on variants of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper mentions using adversarial examples, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, cs.CV, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
