The use of deep learning approaches such as metric learning and triplet network architecture suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the issue of authenticity in digital media content, which is related to the field of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of data compression in social media platforms, which may fall under the sub-category of machine learning for signal processing (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
