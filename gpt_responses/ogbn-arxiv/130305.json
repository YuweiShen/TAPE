Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. The paper also includes experiments on image datasets, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of the Shapley-Folkman lemma and optimization techniques suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.GT (Game Theory) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
