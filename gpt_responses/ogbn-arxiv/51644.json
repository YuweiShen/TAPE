The use of one-bit ADCs is a key aspect of the paper, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also considers the spatial and temporal correlations of channels, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes an adaptive channel estimation technique, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
