The paper also discusses the importance of modeling the visual context surrounding objects, which is a problem that can be tackled using machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of segmentation annotations, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the VOC'12 benchmark, which is a standard dataset used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
