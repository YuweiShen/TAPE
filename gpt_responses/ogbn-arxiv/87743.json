Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves geometry-driven approaches, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves probabilistic modeling, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves multi-view setups, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
