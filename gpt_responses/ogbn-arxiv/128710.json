The paper proposes a new loss function for this task, which involves probabilistic label spaces and the Wasserstein distance, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of deep supervision, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper specifically applies its methods to brain tumour segmentation, which falls under medical imaging (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
