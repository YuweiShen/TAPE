This makes cs.DS the most likely category.\n2. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper deals with the manipulation of polynomials and rational functions, and presents algorithms for computing the greatest common right divisor (gcrd) of a family of linear Mahler operators. This makes cs.SC a likely category.\n3. cs.NT (Number Theory): The paper mentions that solving Mahler equations has occurred in connection with number-theoretic questions. This makes cs.NT a likely category.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper mentions that the presented algorithms have polynomial-time complexity under a mild assumption. This makes cs.CC a likely category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the study of automatic sequences, which can be seen as discrete-time dynamical systems. This makes cs.SY a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
