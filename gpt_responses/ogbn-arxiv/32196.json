The paper focuses on learning a generalized reactive policy (GRP) that maps a problem instance and a state to an action. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Robotics (cs.RO), Planning and Scheduling (cs.PL), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
