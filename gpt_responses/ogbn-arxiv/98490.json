The paper discusses the use of dropout training in deep neural networks to approximate Bayesian inference and estimate model uncertainty. The paper also introduces a new approach to estimating uncertainty by exploiting feature map correlation during training. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of uncertainty in conjunction with a human controller, indicating a potential connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
