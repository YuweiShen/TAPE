The paper also proposes a new network architecture that reduces the complexity of capsule networks, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper uses dynamic routing, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the lack of labeled samples, which is a common problem in neural network training and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with hyperspectral images, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
