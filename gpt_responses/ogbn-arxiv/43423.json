The pipeline involves designing loss functions and neural network architecture, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its proposed algorithm on standard datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
