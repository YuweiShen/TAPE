The paper also discusses the use of perception and planning algorithms, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of sensing and computing for navigation suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another possible category. The paper also addresses the interaction between a fast planner and a slower mapper, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of multi-fidelity models for planning suggests machine learning (cs.LG) as another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
