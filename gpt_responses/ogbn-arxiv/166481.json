The paper also discusses the practical implementation of these algorithms, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper proposes specialized data structures for these sketches, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
