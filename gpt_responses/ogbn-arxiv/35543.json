This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper specifically mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, which is a common application of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, cs.CV is also a likely category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of neural networks for machine learning tasks falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely category.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the use of neural networks, which falls under the domain of neural computing. Therefore, cs.NE is also a possible category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a feedback control strategy for improving the learning efficiency of neural networks, which falls under the domain of systems and control.
