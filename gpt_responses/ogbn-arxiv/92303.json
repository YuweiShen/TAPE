This involves formulating the motion tracking as a Quadratic Program (QP) that takes into account the full robot rigid body dynamics, the actuation limits, the joint limits and the contact interaction. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the controller's robustness against inaccurate friction coefficient estimates and unstable footholds, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of a Quadratic Program also suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also presents practical implementation details, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses experimental trials on a real platform, which could fall under the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
