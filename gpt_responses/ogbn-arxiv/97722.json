The paper also mentions the use of algebraic hardness assumptions, which is a common theme in complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves some information theory (cs.IT) and combinatorics (cs.DS, cs.CG, cs.DM) in the construction of HSGs, which makes these sub-categories likely as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
