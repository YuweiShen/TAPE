This involves the use of adaptive scope selection and random generation of hidden unit parameters. The paper also discusses the self-constructing methodology of deep stacked network structure and the concept of randomly assigning inverse covariance matrix of multivariate Gaussian function in the hidden node addition step. The paper's focus on machine learning, neural networks, and data streams suggests that it is most likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
