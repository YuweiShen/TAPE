The paper proposes a polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem and derives a Grothendieck inequality that characterizes the approximation ratio. The paper uses tools from convex optimization, information theory, and computational geometry, which are all relevant to several subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
