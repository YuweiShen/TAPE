Additionally, the use of autoencoders for learning the mapping between thermal and visible face images suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the impact of alignment on face recognition, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of neural networks for face recognition suggests a possible connection to neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
