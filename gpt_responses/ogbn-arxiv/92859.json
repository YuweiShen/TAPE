The use of evolutionary swarm robotics and distributed evolutionary optimization suggests a focus on machine learning (MA) and artificial intelligence (AI). The mention of self-adaptation and embodied morphogenesis suggests a focus on systems and control (SY). Finally, the use of online onboard embodied evolution suggests a focus on machine learning and reinforcement learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
