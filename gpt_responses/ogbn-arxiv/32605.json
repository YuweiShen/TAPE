The paper also discusses computational challenges and provides a polynomial-time algorithm, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of binary trees and combinatorial bargaining suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories.
