The proposed method involves optimizing the data mapping and data description in order to define a compact class representation in a low-dimensional feature space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Data Mining (cs.DM), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
