Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of higher order derivatives, which is related to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and optimization (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the difficulty of finding higher order local optima, which is related to complexity theory (cs.CC) and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the existence of saddle points, which is related to optimization (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
