It also discusses the implementation of embedded DSLs, which is a common topic in programming language research.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper defines a notion of free applicative functor and proves that it satisfies certain laws, which is a typical topic in formal language theory.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions the use of static analysis on applicative values, which is related to the study of program correctness and verification.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the implementation of embedded DSLs, which is a common topic in software engineering research.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the construction of a free applicative functor, which involves the manipulation of data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
