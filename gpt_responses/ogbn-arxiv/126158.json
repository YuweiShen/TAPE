It also mentions the use of negative information in machine-vision and language modeling, which suggests a possible connection to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the theoretical and experimental performance of the proposed method, which could relate to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
