The method uses a block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which is a popular optimization technique in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions Markov Random Field and graph matching problems, which are common in the sub-category cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper deals with discrete tomography, which is related to the sub-category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
