The paper discusses techniques for incorporating this feedback into NMT training, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of chunk-level feedback, which involves users highlighting correct chunks of a translation. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deal with techniques for improving ML models. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the use of simulation experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed method, which suggests that it may be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deal with user studies and evaluation of ML models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
