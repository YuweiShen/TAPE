The paper also discusses signal scaling and power control policies, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper introduces new achievable schemes for the channel, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
