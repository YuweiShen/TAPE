The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in determining the capacity of the problem. The use of replicated databases and colluding servers suggests a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the consideration of different types of adversaries and their capabilities suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
