Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the cultural and gender differences in emotional body gestures, which falls under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of multi-modal approaches combining speech or face with body gestures suggests the possibility of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also mentions representation learning and the scarcity of labelled data, which are topics in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.RO (Robotics and Control) respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
