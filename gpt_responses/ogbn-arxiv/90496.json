The framework includes two web applications for quality control and session control. The study involves analyzing facial expressions during honest and deceptive communication using a novel interrogation protocol. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as it involves the development of a user interface for participants to follow the research protocol. The study also involves analyzing facial expressions, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of video data also suggests the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia) as relevant. Finally, the study involves communication and social behavior, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
