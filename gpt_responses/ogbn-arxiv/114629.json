It also involves metareasoning, which is a common topic in AI research. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as MCTS is a type of reinforcement learning, and the paper proposes new policies for multi-armed bandits that outperform existing ones. \n\nGame Theory (cs.GT) is another likely sub-category as MCTS is commonly used in game theory research. \n\nData Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) is a possible sub-category as the paper involves developing new sampling policies for MCTS. \n\nFinally, Software Engineering (cs.SE) is a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a new algorithm for MCTS that outperforms existing ones, which could be of interest to software developers working on game AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
