This involves decision-making in complex multi-lane highways and multi-agent environments, which suggests relevance to robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of LIDAR data and coordination of multiple sensors suggests relevance to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the safety-critical nature of autonomous driving systems suggests relevance to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
