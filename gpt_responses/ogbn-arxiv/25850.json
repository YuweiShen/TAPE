Additionally, the paper discusses practical considerations such as sensor configurations and data requirements, which could also fall under the categories of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper proposes that this approach could be used to quantify training dose after stroke, which could fall under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
