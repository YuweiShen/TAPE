Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a reinforcement learning solution, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sidekick policy learning, which is a technique used in reinforcement learning and falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also addresses the challenge of sparse rewards, which is a common problem in robotics, and therefore, it could be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper proposes a solution that involves training an agent to select a short sequence of glimpses, which is a task related to control and decision-making, and therefore, it could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
