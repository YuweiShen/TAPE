Additionally, the paper involves the selection of an agent to execute tasks, which could fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of incentives to achieve socially optimal performance suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
