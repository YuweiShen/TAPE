The approach used in this paper involves generating new words for each input sentence, which is a technique that falls under the category of unsupervised learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also uses a pre-trained language model to generate new words, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and deep learning. This makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) since it involves expanding short sentences with new and relevant feature words to form an artificially enlarged dataset. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible sub-category. \n\nThe paper's approach involves generating new words for each input sentence, which is a technique that falls under the category of unsupervised learning. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's approach involves using a pre-trained language model to generate new words, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks.
