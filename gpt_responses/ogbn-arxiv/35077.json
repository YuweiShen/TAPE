The use of embeddings to measure similarity in continuous space suggests a connection to Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The mention of evaluation for retrieval systems suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of embeddings for similarity measurement can also be applied to computer vision tasks, suggesting a connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
