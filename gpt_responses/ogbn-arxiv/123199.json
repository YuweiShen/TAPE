Therefore, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a novel architecture for cooperative reception that involves information processing and transmission. It also analyzes the performance of the proposed system in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling and phase synchronization. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a distributed system of nodes that communicate and cooperate to achieve a common goal. It also discusses the impact of relaying delay and oscillator drift on the system performance. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system architecture that involves feedback control and synchronization. It also provides an analytical framework to evaluate the system performance and compares it with experimental results. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with signal processing and communication aspects of a system that involves multiple nodes and channels. It also discusses the impact of phase noise and oscillator drift on the quality of received signals. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper presents a prototype implementation of the proposed system on software-defined radios. It also discusses the practical aspects of hardware design and implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
