Therefore, cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper specifically addresses congestion caused by incast, which is a common issue in datacenter networks, so cs.DC (distributed, parallel, and cluster computing) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new congestion control scheme, which involves detecting and responding to incast using explicit notifications, so cs.SY (systems and control) and cs.CR (cryptography and security) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which falls under the performance subfield of computer science, so cs.PF (performance) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
