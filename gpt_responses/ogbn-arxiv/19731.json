The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters and oversampling is a signal processing technique, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also proposes a linear minimum mean-squared error channel estimator, which is a machine learning technique and can be categorized under machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
