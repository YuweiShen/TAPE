The paper discusses the use of sensors in the built environment and their role in state estimation and control of related systems. The paper does not require a model of faulty sensor behavior, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the use of particle filter algorithm suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the accuracy of state estimation, which suggests that it could belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of detecting faulty behavior, which suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
