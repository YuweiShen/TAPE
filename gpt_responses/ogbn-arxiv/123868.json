The use of a large corpus of raw text to automatically discover semantic relations among words suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL). The evaluation of the algorithm's performance suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of neural networks in the algorithm suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
