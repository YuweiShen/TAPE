The paper also discusses attacks on these systems, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper presents new quantitative results, which suggests that the vulnerability of facial verification systems exists due to the geometry of the representation spaces used by these systems. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of algorithms for generating multiple-identity images, which could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
