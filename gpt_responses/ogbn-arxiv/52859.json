This involves studying the impact of antenna directions on localisation accuracy and proposing methods to effectively choose informative antenna directions. The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method in diverse indoor environments. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as the paper deals with improving the accuracy of wireless localisation systems. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory) as the paper deals with improving the quality of radio link behaviour observations, cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the paper proposes a new system for localisation, and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper proposes methods to effectively choose informative antenna directions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
