Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper deals with implementing new side-effects in a modular fashion, which could be relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering). The use of algebraic effects in Prolog could also be relevant to cs.PL.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
