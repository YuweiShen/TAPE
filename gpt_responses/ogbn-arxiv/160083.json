This suggests that the paper falls under the category of Computer Security and Cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the deployment and tuning of frequencies, which could be related to Signal Processing (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the adaptability of audio signals to the security context, which could be related to System and Control (cs.SY) and Security and Privacy (cs.SI). Finally, the paper calls for open research issues, which could be related to Software Engineering (cs.SE) or System and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
