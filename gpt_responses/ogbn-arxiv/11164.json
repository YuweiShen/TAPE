Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category as the paper discusses the perceptual implications of ocular parallax rendering and conducts user experiments to estimate perceptual detection and discrimination thresholds. Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) is another possible sub-category as the paper focuses on improving user experiences in virtual reality. Multimedia (cs.MM) is also a possible sub-category as the paper discusses the use of ocular parallax rendering in virtual reality applications. Finally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not explicitly discuss neural or evolutionary computing, but it may be relevant in the context of developing algorithms for implementing ocular parallax rendering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
