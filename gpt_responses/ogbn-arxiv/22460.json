This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
