The paper focuses on the memory efficiency of DNNs, which is a common concern in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper proposes a new method for optimizing the memory usage of DNNs, it may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
