The paper proposes a novel acyclicity notion for termination of the restricted chase over Horn- \\(\\mathcal {SRIQ}\\) TBoxes, which is a technique used in database systems and knowledge representation. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DB (Databases). The paper also deals with logical reasoning and ontology, which are topics covered by cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.DL (Digital Libraries). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed reasoning procedure, which is a topic that falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
