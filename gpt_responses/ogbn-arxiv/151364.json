Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a novel loss function, which involves optimizing the feature space for better retrieval performance, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two sketch-based 3D shape retrieval benchmarks, indicating a focus on multimedia (MM) techniques. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for retrieving 3D objects based on their features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
