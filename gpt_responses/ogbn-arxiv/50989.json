This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new network architecture for video QA, which involves attention mechanisms and dynamic memory, indicating that it may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on a video dataset, suggesting that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
