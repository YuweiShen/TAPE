This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CY). However, given the focus on digital object storage and manipulation, as well as the use of metadata and context brokers, cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
