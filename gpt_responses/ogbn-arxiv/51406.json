This falls under the domain of information theory, which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of wireless energy transmission for wireless sensor networks, which is a key application area of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The paper involves the use of electromagnetic waves for wireless energy transmission, which falls under the domain of electromagnetics. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper proposes a multi-point scheme for wireless energy transmission, which involves the coordination of multiple agents (i.e., wave sources) to achieve the desired coverage. This falls under the domain of multi-agent systems. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method to overcome the path-loss attenuation and interference between multiple wave sources for wireless energy transmission, which involves the design and control of a system. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
