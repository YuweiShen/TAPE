The paper also applies these theoretical insights to the Reinforcement Learning problem, which is a subfield of AI (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of these methods in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes new methods for solving the stochastic optimal control problem, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
