The focus of the paper is on improving the robustness of these models against noise, which is a common problem in machine learning and can be addressed through various techniques such as regularization and optimization (cs.LG). The application of these models is in self-driving cars, which is a robotics task (cs.RO) and also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
