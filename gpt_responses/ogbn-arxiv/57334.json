The use of operator-valued free probability theory suggests that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI). The specific focus on MIMO systems and the use of correlated fading channels suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the use of approximations and computational efficiency suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
