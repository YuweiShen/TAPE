Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also mentions retrieval question answering, which falls under the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of deep learning models such as Transformer and CNN suggests the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions transfer learning, which is a common topic in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions bitext retrieval, which involves computer vision techniques, suggesting the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
