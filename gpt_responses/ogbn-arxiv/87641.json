The use of social and economic models of centrality and influence in networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of social and information networks (cs.SI) and social computing (cs.SOC). The mention of graph-based methods and pairwise affinity values suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
