The use of cluster analysis methods to group documents based on their identifier usage is also a topic in information retrieval and machine learning. The paper also mentions the use of existing classification schemes such as MSC, PACS, and ACM, which are commonly used in database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper uses Java source code as a dataset for experiments, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
