This involves learning which sensors should send their data to the central node and which to drop data, which is a problem related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach has been evaluated on a multi-view multi-camera dataset, which suggests that the paper may also belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the communication overhead reduction, which is a problem related to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
