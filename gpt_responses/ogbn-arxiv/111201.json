The paper also discusses the effects of different impairments on the system, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Additionally, the proposed algorithms involve grid search and stage-wise approaches, which are related to optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
