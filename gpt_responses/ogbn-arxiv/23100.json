This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses a learning scheme for exploring multiple precision configurations, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.AI, followed by cs.NE and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
