This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of lexicons to improve word embeddings, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of query-log data, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval).
