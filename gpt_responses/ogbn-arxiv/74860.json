Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of distant supervision and multitask learning, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions evaluation sets and benchmarks, which are common in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves the use of crowdsourcing, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
