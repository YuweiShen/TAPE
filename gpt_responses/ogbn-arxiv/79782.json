The problem also involves global knapsack constraints, which is a type of optimization problem and falls under the category of \"Discrete Mathematics\" in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning), followed by \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms).
