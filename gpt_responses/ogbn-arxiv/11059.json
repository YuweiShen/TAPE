The paper also discusses the feasibility of a detection approach based on Intel Processor Trace technology, which involves low-level programming and system-level interactions, making it relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) attacks, which involve manipulating program data structures, making it relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and computer architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of building deployable defenses, which involves system-level interactions and coordination, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
