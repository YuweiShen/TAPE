The paper discusses the use of function approximation techniques to enable RL agents to generalize in order to estimate the value of unvisited states. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of exploration strategies to drive the agent to reduce its uncertainty, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper achieves near state-of-the-art results on high-dimensional RL benchmarks, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
