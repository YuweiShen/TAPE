This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper mentions legal constraints that are inherent to the current modus operandi of infrastructure sharing. This could potentially involve security and privacy concerns, which falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The use of blockchain technology and smart contracts involves distributed computing and could potentially involve parallel and cluster computing as well.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new approach to infrastructure sharing and SLAs, which could involve the use of new data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the potential impact of blockchain technology on telecommunication networks and infrastructure sharing, which could have societal implications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
