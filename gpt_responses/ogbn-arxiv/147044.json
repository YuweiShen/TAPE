This technique is related to data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions using alignments instead of LZ77, which involves compressing and decompressing data, and could be related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the technique, which could be related to computational engineering (cs.CE) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
