This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), where neighboring pixels or words often have interdependent features. The method is based on polynomial activation functions, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The approach is also related to adaptive learning methods (cs.AI), which aim to improve the performance of machine learning models by adapting the learning rate or other parameters. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE, cs.AI, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
