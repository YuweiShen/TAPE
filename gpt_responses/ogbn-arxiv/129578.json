Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes new schemes that leverage a clustering method, which falls under the scope of machine learning. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it falls under the scope of information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
