The use of k-nearest neighbors regression and local median filtering suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) approach to handling functional outliers. The use of distance to a measure for handling geometric outliers suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) approach. Finally, the combination of topological results with noise models suggests a statistical inference (cs.SI) approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
