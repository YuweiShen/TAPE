The use of graphic languages in software development also suggests a possible connection to software design (cs.SD). The paper also mentions the input-process-output framework, which is a common concept in programming languages (cs.PL). The analysis of event processes and their mapping to generic processes could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
