The use of bootstrapping algorithm for selecting the most effective training data and the proposed strategy of suggestive annotation for unlabeled medical data are related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of the modified U-net architecture, which is a popular deep learning model for medical image analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
