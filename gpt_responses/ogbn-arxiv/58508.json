This involves the use of distance features and iterative discriminative classifiers that exploit spatial contextual constraints between bone and cartilage, and between different cartilages. This is a problem that is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), as well as medical imaging (cs.MED) and neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
