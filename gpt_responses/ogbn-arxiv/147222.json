The approach uses expected information density maps, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of a robotic electrolocation platform for target estimation suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
