The proposed approach involves joint detection and pose estimation, which requires a significant amount of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The formulation of the problem as an integer linear program suggests optimization and algorithmic aspects, which are relevant to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The experiments involve multiple datasets and evaluation metrics, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
