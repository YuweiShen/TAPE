This involves training the networks with backpropagation through time to handle memory requirements. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of neural networks also suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses learning directly from pixels, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
