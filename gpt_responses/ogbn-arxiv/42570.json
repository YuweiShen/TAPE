The techniques used in the paper involve linear sketches, which are a popular tool in streaming algorithms and compressed sensing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves combinatorial constructions and analysis, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
