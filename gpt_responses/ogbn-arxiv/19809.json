The use of 360-degree images requires sophisticated spatial understanding and reasoning, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also proposes two different VQA models, which involve machine learning and deep learning techniques, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents a dataset and pre-trained models, which can be useful for multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV) researchers. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.GR, cs.MM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
