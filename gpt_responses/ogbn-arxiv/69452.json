The network is trained by supervised learning (cs.LG) on game states labelled by Puppet Search, a strategic search algorithm that uses action abstractions. The experiments are conducted in the microRTS game (cs.RO), which is a subfield of AI and game theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
