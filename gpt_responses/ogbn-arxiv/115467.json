It proposes a content-oriented cognitive interference control strategy for city monitoring applications, where a video data stream generated by a camera system is remotely processed to detect objects. This involves the use of multiple communication technologies, such as Device-to-Device and Long Term Evolution (LTE), and the extension of the cognitive network paradigm to dynamically shape the interference pattern generated by concurrent data streams. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
