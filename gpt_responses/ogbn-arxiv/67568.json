The paper proposes a new exploration strategy for sample-efficient episodic control methods in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses Atari games as a benchmark, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
