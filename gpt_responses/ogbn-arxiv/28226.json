The method involves global structure inference and local geometry refinement networks, which are trained in an end-to-end manner. The paper focuses on computer vision (CV) and graphics (GR) applications, and uses deep neural networks (NE) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The paper also involves a significant amount of data processing and analysis, which could fall under the machine learning (LG) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
