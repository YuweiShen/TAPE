The authors also use computational complexity theory to analyze the problem, which suggests that cs.AI and cs.DS are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves experiments to evaluate the equilibria, which could fall under cs.LG. Finally, the topic of assigning goods to agents is closely related to mechanism design and social choice theory, which are covered in cs.EC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
