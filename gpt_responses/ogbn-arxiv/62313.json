The proposed approach involves end-to-end training of a neural network, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of segmentation-based text detection, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on standard text benchmarks, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
