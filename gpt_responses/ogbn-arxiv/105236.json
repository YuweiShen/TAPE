The paper proposes a method to reduce the Cubic Metric (CM) of the signal, which is a measure of the nonlinear distortion caused by the power amplifier. This topic is closely related to information theory and signal processing, making cs.IT the most likely category. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with reducing the distortion in wireless communication systems caused by nonlinear power amplifiers. This topic is closely related to communication and networking, making cs.COMM a likely category. \n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method to reduce the Cubic Metric (CM) of the OFDM signal, which is a measure of the nonlinear distortion caused by the power amplifier. This topic is closely related to systems and control, making cs.SI a likely category. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with reducing the distortion in wireless communication systems caused by nonlinear power amplifiers. This topic is closely related to networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI a likely category. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the Method of Conditional Expectations (CE Method"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
