Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, as it aims to optimize the image selection strategy. This suggests cs.IR as a likely sub-category. The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests cs.AI as a possible sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning (ML) techniques, as it trains a deep reinforcement model and extends a recently introduced ML model. This suggests cs.LG as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) techniques, as it deals with image databases and visual embeddings. This suggests cs.MM as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
