This problem is related to network control and can be applied to social and information networks. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes new schemes to recover signals defined in the nodes of a graph. The focus is on reconstructing bandlimited graph signals, which are signals that admit a sparse representation in a frequency domain related to the structure of the graph. This problem is related to information theory and signal processing. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of percolating a sparse signal across a graph using a graph filter. This problem is related to networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method to interpolate graph signals using a graph filter. This problem is related to machine learning and signal processing. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper interprets graph signals as network states and studies graph-signal reconstruction as a network-control problem. This problem is related to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
