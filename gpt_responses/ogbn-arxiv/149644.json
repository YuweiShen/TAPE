This involves security considerations. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an auction-based framework for spectrum allocation that involves the use of CRs to make a global inference on the availability of the spectrum. This involves AI techniques such as machine learning and decision making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
