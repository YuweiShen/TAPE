This involves numerical methods and analysis, making cs.NA a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with mapping functions defined on a cube or simplex, which are geometric objects. Additionally, the use of Bernstein-Bezier polynomials is common in computational geometry. Hence, cs.CG is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper's focus on polynomial mapping functions and curved meshes is relevant to computer graphics, especially in the context of surface modeling and rendering. Therefore, cs.GR is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The use of Bernstein-Bezier polynomials involves symbolic manipulation of polynomials, which is a topic in symbolic computation. Hence, cs.SC is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on invertibility of polynomial mapping functions is relevant to control theory, where invertibility is an important property of systems. Therefore, cs.SY is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
