The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The real-time post-processing mentioned in the paper may also fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the implementation of a 3D avatar application running on mobile devices suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
