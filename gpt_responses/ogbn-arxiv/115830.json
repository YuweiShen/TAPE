The paper also proposes an evolutionary optimization algorithm, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses MATLAB simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which can be classified under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
