The paper also introduces a combination of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for time series data and a Neural Network for other pollution influential factors such as weather to build a merged prediction model, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper deals with spatiotemporal big data, which can be categorized under the subfield of spatial informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
