The paper proposes a new framework for regression-based facial landmarks detection, which involves training a single self-iterative regressor, and hence it is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning-based methods, which makes it relevant to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper involves the use of regression-based methods, which can be considered as a subfield of neural networks, and hence it is likely to belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
