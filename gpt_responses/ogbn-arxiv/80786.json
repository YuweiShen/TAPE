The technique presented in the paper involves simulating the effects of a reaction force in a visual way, which falls under the category of virtual reality (cs.VR). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) to track real objects in the mixed reality environment. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the technique, which could involve robotics (cs.RO) in the future."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
