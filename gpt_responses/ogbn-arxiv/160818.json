This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of alternative methods for constructing simplicial complexes and the effects of making associated choices during construction, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The application of these methods to a voting data set could also fall under the category of graphics (cs.GR) or information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
