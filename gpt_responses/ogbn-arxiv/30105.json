The paper also discusses the storage format and memory requirements, which suggests that it may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The database generation process involves collecting data from a diverse group of writers, which may be of interest to machine learning (cs.LG) researchers studying bias and fairness. Finally, the paper's focus on handwriting recognition suggests that it may also be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
