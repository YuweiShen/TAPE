The paper proposes a novel interpretable malware detector using a hierarchical Transformer network and a feed-forward neural network, which involves natural language processing techniques (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the performance and interpretability of the proposed model, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
