The use of algebraic curves and the study of their properties suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The analysis of the minimum distance of the codes and their duals may fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The study of the exponents of matrices used for defining the codes may also be relevant to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of Castle Curves, which are a specific type of algebraic curves, may suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
