The use of linear dependent types and proof obligations also suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO) and type theory (cs.TL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of external solvers, which could fall under formal methods (cs.FL) or data structures (cs.DS) depending on the specific solver used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
