Additionally, the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a new architecture for neural networks. The use of gating functions is a common technique in neural networks, which may also make this paper relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as LSTMs have been used in image captioning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
