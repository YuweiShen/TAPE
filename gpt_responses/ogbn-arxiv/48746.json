This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves using attributes to condition the selection of positive examples, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV) or natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which could be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
