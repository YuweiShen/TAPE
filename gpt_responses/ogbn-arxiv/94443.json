The paper proposes a new algorithm for domain-specific face synthesis to improve the performance of still-to-video face recognition systems. This involves clustering faces based on pose and illumination estimation, projecting domain-specific variations onto reference stills, and generating synthetic faces. The paper also discusses the use of sparse representation classification and cross-domain dictionaries. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
