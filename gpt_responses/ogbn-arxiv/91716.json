The paper also discusses the use of specialized networks for different scales, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the practical runtime speed of the network, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
