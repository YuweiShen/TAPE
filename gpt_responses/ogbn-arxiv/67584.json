The method involves learning two groups of latent random variables and using a regularized loss based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient to encourage de-correlation between them. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE), cybernetics (cs.CY), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
