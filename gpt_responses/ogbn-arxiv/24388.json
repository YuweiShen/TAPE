The paper also discusses the decidability of the new class, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions several other decidable classes, which suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
