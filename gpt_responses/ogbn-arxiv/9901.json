This topic is closely related to machine learning and optimization, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.IT sub-categories. The paper also introduces notions of coherence and graph-theoretic structural constants, which are related to numerical analysis and scientific computing, covered by the cs.NA sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the trade-off between computation and storage requirements, which is relevant to data structures and algorithms, covered by the cs.DS sub-category. Finally, the empirical results support the theory and justify the use of a broader family of structured matrices, which is related to computational complexity and theoretical computer science, covered by the cs.SI sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
