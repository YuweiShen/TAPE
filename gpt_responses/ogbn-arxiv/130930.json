The proposed approach uses a graph convolutional neural network (Graph CNN) and introduces two new terms into the loss function. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of a neural network and loss function indicates that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the problem of human mesh reconstruction involves understanding and modeling human anatomy, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
