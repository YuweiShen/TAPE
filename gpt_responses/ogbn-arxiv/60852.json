The applications to NLP and image quality evaluation also suggest a machine learning focus.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with optimal transport and Wasserstein metrics, which are closely related to information theory and communication theory. The use of Gaussian measures and the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport also suggest an information theory perspective.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper mentions applications to image quality evaluation (FID scores), which is a common problem in computer vision. The use of optimal transport and Wasserstein metrics is also relevant to computer vision tasks such as image registration and object tracking.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms to select optimal subspaces and compute optimal transport plans, which are core topics in data structures and algorithms. The use of optimal transport and Wasserstein metrics also suggests a connection to computational geometry and optimization.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport, which is a well-known concept in control theory and system identification. The use of optimal transport and Wasserstein metrics is also relevant to control and estimation problems in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
