Additionally, the use of neural models and attention mechanisms suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are also relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper's focus on social communities such as Twitter and Reddit suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
