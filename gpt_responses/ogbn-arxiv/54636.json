The use of artificial intelligence techniques, particularly multiagent systems, is highlighted as a promising field of application. The paper proposes a distributed, market-inspired mechanism for intersection management, which suggests a focus on multiagent systems and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
