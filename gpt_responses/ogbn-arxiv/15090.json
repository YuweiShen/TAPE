The use of entropy models and optimization for rate-distortion performance suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also involves the use of side information and adaptation to specific images, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT). The use of machine learning techniques for image compression suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
