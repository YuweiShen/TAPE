The paper also discusses the use of sparse signal representation and sparse error correction, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a dictionary of training images, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT).
