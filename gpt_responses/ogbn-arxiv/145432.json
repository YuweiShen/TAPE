It also uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves training the CNNs, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of a regularizer to enforce circular patterns in the weights of the spatial filters suggests that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on improving data-efficiency and generalization suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of the Traffic Sign data set suggests that it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category, as this data set is commonly used in natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
