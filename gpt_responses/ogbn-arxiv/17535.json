The proposed improvement involves allowing an LSTM layer to carry out internal computation within its memory, which is a concept that is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, LSTM is often used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV) such as image captioning, so this paper could also be relevant to that sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
