The paper also introduces a higher-order dependency pair framework, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and formal languages (cs.FL). The implementation of the framework in the WANDA tool suggests a software engineering (cs.SE) aspect. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of two existing approaches, which could be considered as a form of scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
