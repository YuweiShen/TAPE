The paper also explores the relationship between two formalisms used to model protocols for distributed systems, namely strand spaces and multi-agent systems. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
