The use of complex network concepts to represent texts and identify relevant sentences is a novel approach that can be applied to several sub-fields of computer science. However, given the focus on textual data and language processing, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other possible sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DL (Machine Learning), and cs.LG (Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
