The paper proposes a new approach called Symmetric Cross Entropy Learning (SL) to address this problem. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given that the paper focuses on deep neural networks and learning with noisy labels, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
