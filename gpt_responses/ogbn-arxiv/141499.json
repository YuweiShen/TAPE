The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper presents a novel framework for machine learning on resource-constrained platforms. The second likely category is cs.IOT (Internet of Things), as the paper specifically addresses the challenges of deploying machine learning on IoT devices. The third likely category is cs.EM (Embedded Systems), as the paper deals with the implementation of machine learning on embedded devices. The fourth likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper discusses the interplay of hardware, compiler optimizations, and code dependencies in the deployment of machine learning models. The fifth likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper presents a new approach to automating the deployment of machine learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
