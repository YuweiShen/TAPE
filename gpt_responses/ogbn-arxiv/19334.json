The paper proposes an adaptive truncation scheme for backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to control gradient bias in RNNs. This topic is most closely related to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on language modeling tasks, which falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for non-convex loss, which is relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.CL, cs.AI, and cs.CV, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
