This topic falls under the field of wireless communication, which is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also involves the analysis of symbol error rate (SER), which is a performance metric commonly used in communication systems, and thus, the paper may also fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Moreover, the paper involves the design and analysis of detectors, which is a topic related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA). Finally, the paper involves the use of multiple receiving antennas, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
