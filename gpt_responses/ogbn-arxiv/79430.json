The proposed method involves the use of saliency maps to generate visually natural examples, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision and image processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deblurring mechanisms, which is a topic in computer graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper involves the study of the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new attacking method, which involves the use of kernel prediction, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
