It could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper discusses the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial attacks. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep learning is a subfield of AI. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing adversarial attacks, which could place it under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the proposed global adversarial attack methods involve optimization techniques, which could place the paper under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
