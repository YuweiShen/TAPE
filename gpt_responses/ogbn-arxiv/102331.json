The paper focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques for detecting plagiarism, which are typically covered in the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for comparing large documents, which is covered in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. The use of word embeddings and machine learning models for detecting plagiarism falls under the cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves multi-lingual NLP techniques, which could be covered in the cs.CY (Computing and Language) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.IR, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
