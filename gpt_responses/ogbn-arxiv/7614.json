The attack is hardware-oriented but software-controlled, which suggests a possible overlap with computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also mentions the use of privileged processes and trusted execution environments, which are common topics in software engineering (cs.SE) and systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the attack, which involves software-based attacks against Intel SGX enclaves, indicating a possible connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
