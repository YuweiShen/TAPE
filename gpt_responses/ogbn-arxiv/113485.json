The use of agile concepts and software tools for development suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and system engineering (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of a simulator for testing, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) as well. Finally, the overall topic of autonomous driving and artificial intelligence suggests a potential fit for the artificial intelligence sub-category (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
