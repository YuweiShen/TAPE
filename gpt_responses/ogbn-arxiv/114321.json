The specific application of the compression technique is in acoustic models for speech recognition (cs.CL), which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.AI). The paper also utilizes low rank factorization, which is a common technique in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
