The paper specifically focuses on developing a new convolution operator and fully connected layer operator for complex-valued data, which are fundamental building blocks in deep learning models for computer vision and signal processing tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.NA, cs.AI, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
