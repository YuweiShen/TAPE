The paper also discusses the challenges of processing large amounts of data subject to limited computational and storage capabilities, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a map management process that allows building and maintaining maps for precise visual localization, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
