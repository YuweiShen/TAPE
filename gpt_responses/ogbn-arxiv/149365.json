The focus on temporal evolution and dynamic systems suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY). The examination of different approaches for constructing TIDs and evaluating their accuracy/efficiency suggests a connection to data science (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
