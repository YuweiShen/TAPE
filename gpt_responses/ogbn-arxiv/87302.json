The paper also proposes new approaches to protect ML models from MIA, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the analysis of the impact of data properties on MIA vulnerability suggests that the paper could also be classified under data science (cs.DS) and possibly social and information networks (cs.SI) due to the focus on privacy and fairness in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
