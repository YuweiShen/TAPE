The use of linear codes in the storage system suggests coding theory (cs.CR) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC) as relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the capacity-achieving properties of certain codes, which could fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
