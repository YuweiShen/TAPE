This work is related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI), as well as computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) due to the use of multilabel classification. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of graphs, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
