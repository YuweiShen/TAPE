The paper also involves the use of data structures to preprocess polytopes, which is a common technique in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of linear programming and optimization techniques, which are commonly studied in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the application of these results to a well-studied problem in control theory, which falls under the systems and control category (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
