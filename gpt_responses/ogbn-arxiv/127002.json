The theory has applications in natural language processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, reasoning, planning, and unsupervised learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI. The paper also discusses information compression, which is related to machine learning and data compression, making cs.LG and cs.IT likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions natural language parsing and production, which falls under cs.CL.
