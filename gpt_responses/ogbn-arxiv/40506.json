The paper also discusses the use of deep learning in decision-making tasks, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper introduces new techniques for summarizing and visualizing neural network features, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of dataset examples to help users understand neural network models, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
