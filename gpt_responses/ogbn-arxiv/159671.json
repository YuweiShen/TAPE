The paper also discusses the use of weights and scenarios, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE). The application of the proposed metric is demonstrated in a visual object detection unit, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
