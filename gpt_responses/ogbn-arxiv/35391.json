Specifically, the paper proposes a method for distilling a Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior predictive density into a more compact form, namely a single deep neural network. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions applications involving bandits or active learning, which are areas that are often studied in the subfields of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's focus on Bayesian methods and control systems (as evidenced by the mention of SGLD) suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
