The paper discusses optimization techniques for weakly submodular functions, which are relevant to the fields of optimization, algorithms, and discrete mathematics. The paper also introduces a novel relaxation of submodularity, which is a concept studied in optimization and combinatorial optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
