This falls under the domain of mechanism design, which is a subfield of game theory. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a mechanism that combines learning the cost distribution with incentivizing effort exertion. This involves using machine learning techniques to estimate the cost distribution, which falls under the domain of AI. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a sequential mechanism that involves learning the cost distribution. This involves using machine learning techniques, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on designing mechanisms to incentivize workers in a crowdsourcing setting. This involves understanding human behavior and interaction with computer systems, which falls under the domain of human-computer interaction. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of crowdsourcing and incentives to elicit effort from workers. This has implications for the social and ethical aspects of computing, which falls under the domain of computers and society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
