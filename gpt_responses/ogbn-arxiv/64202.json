The use of Neural Networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. The focus on relative pose estimation suggests that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category. The use of a reinforcement- and ranking-based training framework suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the use of unsupervised learning suggests that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
