Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses factors that contribute to effective pretraining, such as model capacity and data domain, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper presents state-of-the-art results on NER and constituency parsing benchmarks, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
