This falls under the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper also proposes a new method for imposing equality constraints, which is relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the advantages of the proposed method in terms of locality, which is relevant to the field of systems and control (cs.SY) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
