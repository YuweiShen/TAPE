Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, AutoML involves artificial intelligence techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The use of datasets also suggests that this paper could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper involves testing and comparing different AutoML solutions, which could also fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
