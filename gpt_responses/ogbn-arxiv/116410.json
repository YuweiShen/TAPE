Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves text data processing, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques, which is a subfield of cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves fine-tuning of pretrained models, which is a common technique in cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with multimedia content, which is a subfield of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
