The use of belief function theory to model preferences under uncertainty suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI) or machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes an algorithm for constructing a collective preference order, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as it deals with a community of different persons expressing their preferences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
