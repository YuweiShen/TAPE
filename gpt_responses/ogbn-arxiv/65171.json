This is a typical topic in discrete mathematics.\n- cs.GT (Graph Theory): The paper is about a specific type of graph called a 4-wheel and its properties. This falls under the scope of graph theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Although the paper does not explicitly mention algorithms or data structures, the problem of 4-coloring a graph is a classic algorithmic problem and may be of interest to researchers in this sub-category.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper may be relevant to researchers in computational geometry because it deals with the structure of graphs and cycles.\n- cs.CO (Combinatorics): The paper's focus on subgraphs and graph coloring may be of interest to researchers in combinatorics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
