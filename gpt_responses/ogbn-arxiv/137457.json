The paper focuses on the practical aspect of fast deployment of learned gaits in low-cost hardware. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics) which deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The paper also uses machine learning techniques, specifically reinforcement learning, to generate the walking trajectories. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. Additionally, the paper deals with the optimization of policies for each half walking step, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the sim-to-real transfer of the learned policy, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper uses cubic splines to interpolate between the way-points for the foot trajectories, which falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
