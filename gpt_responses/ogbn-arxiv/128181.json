The approach involves modeling variations in representations using residual vectors, which is a common technique in deep learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of pre-training on videos or images, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper explores the capabilities of the proposed model in exploiting similarity in features across frames, which is relevant to graphics (cs.GR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
