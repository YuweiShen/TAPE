The algorithm proposed in the paper uses game theory (cs.GT) and distributed decision-making (cs.SY) to provide resilience to the robot team against failures of individual robots and improve overall efficiency. The use of Potential Games aligns the utility of each player with a shared objective function for all players, which is a common approach in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the coordination of multiple robots, which falls under the subfield of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
