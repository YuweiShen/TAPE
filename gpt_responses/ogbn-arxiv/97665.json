The paper also describes applications of these structures in algorithms such as Prim's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm and Dijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm, which are commonly studied in the fields of discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG).
