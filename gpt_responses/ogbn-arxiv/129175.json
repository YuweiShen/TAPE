The paper also introduces a technique called Rao-Blackwellisation to increase the efficiency of particle filtering. Given the focus on machine learning and robotics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
