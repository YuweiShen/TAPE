This falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG). The analysis heavily relies on the use of Gaussian min-max theorem (GMT), which is a tool from information theory (cs.IT). The paper also derives an asymptotic lower bound on the minimum conic singular values of isotropically random orthogonal (i.r.o.) matrices, which is a problem in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper deals with the performance comparison of different ensembles of measurement matrices, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
