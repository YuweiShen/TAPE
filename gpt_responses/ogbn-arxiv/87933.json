The paper also mentions the use of two different systems, Google Translate and DEEPL, which are both based on machine learning algorithms and therefore could also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions testing the ability of the systems to correctly translate difficult grammatical words, which could involve the use of neural networks and other techniques commonly used in NLP and machine learning. Therefore, categories such as neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) could also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
