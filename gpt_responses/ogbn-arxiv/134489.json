The use of group extensions and cohomology suggests that the paper may belong to cs.GT (Group Theory), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), or cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The mention of code equivalence, coset intersection, and cyclicity testing suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
