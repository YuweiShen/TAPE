It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with video analysis. Additionally, it may belong to Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a method based on point-wise mutual information. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possibility as the proposed method involves reasoning about region assignments. Finally, it may belong to Graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with spatio-temporal voxels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
