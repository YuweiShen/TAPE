The use of pairwise comparisons as a learning model is also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of these functions in social networks, which could fall under the category of social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
