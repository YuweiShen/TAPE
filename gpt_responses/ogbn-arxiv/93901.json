This involves learning large-scale seen domain knowledge and leveraging a feature synthesizer to generate unseen class features. The paper also introduces an IoU-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IoUGAN) for synthesizing features with both intra-class variance and IoU variance. Given that the paper deals with object detection and generative models, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
