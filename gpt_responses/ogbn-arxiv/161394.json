It may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category because it involves leveraging metadata to control text generation. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category due to the use of bidirectional training and the release of GPT-2 models. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category due to the focus on generating text with specific characteristics. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category due to the use of Transformer-based models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
