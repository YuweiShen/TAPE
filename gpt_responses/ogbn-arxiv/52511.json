Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a self-supervised learning method, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of epipolar geometry and camera parameters suggests that the paper may also be relevant to robotics and control, hence cs.RO (Robotics and Control). The proposed performance measure, Pose Structure Score (PSS), is a novel evaluation metric that could be of interest to researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically in the area of pose estimation, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with the structural plausibility of poses, which could be relevant to researchers in the field of computer graphics, hence cs.GR (Computer Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
