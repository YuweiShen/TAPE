The use of multiplexing to combine messages sent in parallel executions of protocols is related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the direct-sum problem, which is a well-studied problem in distributed computing and falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The formalization of sufficient conditions for communication complexity savings involves combinatorial and graph-theoretic arguments, which are typical of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper mentions communication patterns, which are relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
