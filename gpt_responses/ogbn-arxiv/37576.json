The algorithm is evaluated on both a 2D MNIST Maze environment and 49 games of the Atari 2600 environment. Given the focus on deep reinforcement learning and the evaluation on Atari games, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
