The use of redundancy and erasure codes also suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The probabilistic analysis and experiments conducted in the paper also suggest that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of linear transforms and resilience to stragglers suggests that the paper could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques and trade-offs suggests that the paper could belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
