Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely sub-categories. The system also uses a convolutional neural network, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the potential security risks associated with maritime collisions, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
