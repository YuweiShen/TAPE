This involves modeling uncertainty and optimizing policies for varying levels of conditional Value-at-Risk. The approach is demonstrated in the domain of driving simulations. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
