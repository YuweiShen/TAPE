The assumption that the channel states take values in a finite alphabet suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses achievable rates and upper bounds, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses directed information, which is a concept from causality and information theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
