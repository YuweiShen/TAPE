The paper proposes a new approach to credit assignment that uses new information in hindsight, rather than employing foresight. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). However, given the focus on reinforcement learning, we believe that cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
