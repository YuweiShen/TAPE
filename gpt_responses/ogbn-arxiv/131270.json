The use of heavy-tailed noise as a better model for situations where outliers exist suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The proposed algorithmic framework and optimization techniques suggest that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the discussion of convergence properties and simulations suggest that the paper may also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
