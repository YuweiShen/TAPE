Additionally, the paper proposes the use of evaluation methodologies from cognitive load theory, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the possibility of using artificial intelligence techniques for graph evaluation (cs.AI) and the use of computer vision techniques for graph analysis (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes deriving aesthetics based on graph internal structural features, which falls under the category of computational social science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
