The use of majorization and stochastic orders in the proofs suggests a connection to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The extension of the information-theoretic central limit theorem and law of small numbers explored in the paper suggests a connection to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-categories.
