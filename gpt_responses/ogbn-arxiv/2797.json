The focus on peer review and publication/funding characteristics suggests cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.CY (Computers and Society) as likely categories. The mention of \"normalization for discipline-characteristic performance levels\" suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as possible categories. Finally, the use of quantitative measures and performance evaluation suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a potential category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
