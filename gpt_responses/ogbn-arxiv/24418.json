The use of R\\'enyi divergence measures is a common tool in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG), and the paper provides new results in this area. The paper also involves the analysis of asymptotics, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.DS). The simulation problem is relevant in control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
