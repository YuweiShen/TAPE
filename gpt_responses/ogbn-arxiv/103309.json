This involves the use of a grammar to constrain the random walkers, which is a user-defined data structure that determines the meaning of the final vertex ranking. These concepts are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
