This involves the use of a multivariate mixture model and maximum likelihood estimator for texture classification of the images. The method also corrects for misregistration using transformations assigned to the images. Given the focus on image analysis and machine learning techniques, the most likely sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of medical imaging data and the focus on cardiac health suggest the sub-categories of medical imaging (cs.MED) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also likely. Finally, the use of the iterated conditional mode algorithm for optimization suggests the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NEURON) as a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
