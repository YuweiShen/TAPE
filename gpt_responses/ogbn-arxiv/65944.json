The use of positive definite kernels and embedding techniques suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach. The tasks mentioned in the abstract, such as clustering, sparse coding, and hashing, are also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
