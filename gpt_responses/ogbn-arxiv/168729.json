It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves training a dual-encoder model. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves natural language processing and representation learning. The paper also mentions using embeddings for image captioning, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper mentions using neural networks for learning, which could place it under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
