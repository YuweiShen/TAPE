These are all topics that fall under the umbrella of machine learning and optimization, which are typically covered in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a general notion of spikiness and rank for the unknown matrix, which involves analyzing the structure of the matrix and its properties. This is a topic that is often studied in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also relies on techniques from numerical analysis and optimization, which are covered in the cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category. Finally, the paper provides tail bounds for the estimation error, which is a topic that falls under the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
