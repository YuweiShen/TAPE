This involves addressing the partially observable planning problem and mitigating the sparse reward problem. The paper also provides simulation and experimental results to validate the proposed approach. Given these factors, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics and Control). However, the paper also involves machine learning techniques such as convolutional networks and policy gradient algorithms, which suggest possible sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the use of convolutional networks suggests a possible sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision), while the use of a differentiable memory suggests a possible sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
