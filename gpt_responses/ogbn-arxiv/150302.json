GNNs are a type of neural network that are tailored to learn and model information structured as graphs. The paper focuses on the application of GNNs to accurately estimate performance metrics such as delay and jitter in SDN, which suggests a likely fit with the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of GNNs for optimization, which could fit with the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper's focus on SDN and network optimization could also fit with the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
