The paper also proposes a new inductive approach to prosodic analysis, which is a common theme in NLP research. \n\n2. cs.SD (Sound): The paper deals with the analysis of speech signals, which is a sub-area of sound processing. The proposed Rhythm Formant Analysis (RFA) method is based on the low-frequency spectrum of the speech signal, which is a common feature in sound processing research. \n\n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the analysis of speech signals, which is a sub-area of signal processing. The proposed Rhythm Formant Analysis (RFA) method is based on the low-frequency spectrum of the speech signal, which is a common feature in signal processing research. \n\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques for prosody analysis, which is a common theme in machine learning research. The proposed Rhythm Formant Analysis (RFA) method is also based on an inductive approach, which is a common feature in machine learning research. \n\n5. cs.SD (Acoustics): The paper deals"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
