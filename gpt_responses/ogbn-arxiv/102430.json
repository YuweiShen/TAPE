This involves techniques from machine learning (spectral clustering), artificial intelligence (tensor learning), computer vision (multi-view representation), and statistics (Markov chain). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also involves optimization techniques (ADMM) and deals with high-dimensional data (tensor), which are relevant to sub-categories cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
