The regularity conditions and convexity requirements on the divergence function suggest that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). The focus on connectivity and planarity of the dual graph may indicate a connection to graph theory (cs.DS) and possibly also to algorithms and data structures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
