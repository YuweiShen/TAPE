The proposed method uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and a reward function based on the Social Force Model (SFM), which are both subfields of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of describing the world and using a reward adapted to the environment, which are topics related to Machine Learning (cs.LG). The inclusion of obstacles to improve navigation is related to control systems (cs.SY), and the simulations done to test the proposed method involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
