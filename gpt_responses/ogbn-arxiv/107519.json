Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses different solutions inspired by the hashing literature, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of product quantization to store word embeddings could be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it is a common technique in this field. Additionally, the paper mentions experiments carried out on several benchmarks, which could be related to cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), depending on the nature of the benchmarks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
