The proposed method involves modeling the bounding box with a Gaussian parameter and redesigning the loss function, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a method for predicting localization uncertainty, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
