The paper also explores the effect of network architecture on the loss landscape, which is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural engineering (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of training parameters on the shape of minimizers, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
