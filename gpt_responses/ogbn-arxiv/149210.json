This involves machine learning techniques for data selection and compression. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the dynamic adaptation of IoT data processing and transmission within \"wireless islands\", where a set of sensing devices (sensors) are interconnected through one-hop wireless links to a computational resource via a local access point. This involves networking and internet architecture aspects. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed system where local classifiers at the mobile nodes filter the data streams and provide only the needed information to the global classifier at the edge processor, thus minimizing bandwidth usage. This involves distributed computing aspects. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system where the edge processor plays a key role by establishing a link between content and operations within the distributed system. This involves systems and control aspects. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper formulates an optimization problem for the dynamic construction of the classifiers under bandwidth and energy constraints. This involves information theory aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
