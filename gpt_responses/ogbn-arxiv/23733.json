The measures studied in the paper, $c_{\\cal M}(d)$ and $c_{\\cal M}$, are related to combinatorics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of randomized algorithms and probability theory suggests a possible connection to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
