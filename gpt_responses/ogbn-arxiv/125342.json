The paper also discusses the computational complexity of computing strategic votes, which is a topic relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of scoring rules and tournament graphs also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
