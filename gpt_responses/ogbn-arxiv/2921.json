The use of deep learning models, specifically CNNs, is also mentioned. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of an ensemble of models suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the use of facial landmark points for alignment may suggest cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of pretrained models and fine-tuning may suggest cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and the mention of the ChaLearn LAP 2016 challenge may suggest cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
