The algorithm merges geometric properties with information-theoretic properties, which suggests it may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of distributional coordinates as a feature extraction mechanism suggests it may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the mention of benefits on synthetic examples suggests it may also be relevant to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
