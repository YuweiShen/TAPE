The use of neural networks for control policies suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) aspect to the work. The robustness of the policies to external disturbances and harsh initial conditions indicates a systems and control (cs.SY) component. The use of different training methodologies such as change of cost function and domain randomization suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) aspect. Finally, the use of simulation and transfer to physical quadrotors suggests a computer vision (cs.CV) aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
