This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel architecture to remove texture bias, which involves modifying the feature space, and uses a bi-directional convolutional long-short-term-memory to merge the multi scale-space representations. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper performs experiments on two well-known few-shot segmentation benchmarks, which suggests that it may also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
