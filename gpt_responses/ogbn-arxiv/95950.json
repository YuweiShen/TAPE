The paper also presents a two-phase encryption technique for encrypting question papers and analyzes the security of the proposed scheme. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper utilizes blockchain technology for storing and sharing encrypted question papers in a distributed manner. \n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a new scheme for question sharing in the education system which involves storing encrypted question papers in a blockchain along with a smart contract. \n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes an algorithm for selecting a question paper randomly for the exam and imposes a timestamp-based lock on the scheme to prevent unauthorized access. \n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the issue of question paper leaking in the education system and proposes a secure and flexible question sharing system using blockchain technology, which can have a positive impact on the society by improving the quality of education."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
