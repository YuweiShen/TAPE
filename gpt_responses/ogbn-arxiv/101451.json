The approach involves leveraging common-sense knowledge to guide the algorithm towards learning the correct detections, which falls under the realm of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of knowledge bases to acquire common-sense cues also suggests a potential overlap with natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach that improves upon existing transfer-learning baselines, which could be of interest to the machine learning community (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
