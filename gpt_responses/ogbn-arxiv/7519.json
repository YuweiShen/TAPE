The paper also introduces a new representation of the objective function that is based on submodularity, which is a concept that is commonly used in the field of data science (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.CE). Finally, the paper presents experiments on two real-world applications that involve human decision-making, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
