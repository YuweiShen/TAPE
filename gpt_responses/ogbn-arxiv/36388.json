The proposed method involves taking into account the importance of attributes for each class, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a new dataset for pose classification based on wearable sensors, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
