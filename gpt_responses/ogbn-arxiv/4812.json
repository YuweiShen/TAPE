Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), and databases (cs.DB). The paper also introduces algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the category of algorithms (cs.AL) or data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
