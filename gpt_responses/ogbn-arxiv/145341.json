The paper also introduces a new information-theoretic quantity that can be applied to continuous random variables, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The experiments conducted in the paper involve supervised learning, regularization, and uncertainty quantification, which are all common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
