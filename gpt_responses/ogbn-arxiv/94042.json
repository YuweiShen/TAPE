The focus of the paper is on the use of adaptive sensing, which involves selecting the rows of the measurement matrix based on previous measurements. This is a topic that is relevant to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG), as well as multimedia (cs.MM) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The fact that the rows of the measurement matrix are subject to physical constraints suggests that the paper may also be relevant to topics such as control systems (cs.SY) or robotics (cs.RO), but these are less likely than the other categories listed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
