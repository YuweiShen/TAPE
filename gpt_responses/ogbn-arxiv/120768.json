This involves systems and control concepts such as optimization and convexity. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the simultaneous transfer of wireless information and power, which can be considered as a multimedia application. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes alternative algorithms to obtain optimal solutions for the beamforming design, which involves computational techniques such as uplink-downlink duality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
