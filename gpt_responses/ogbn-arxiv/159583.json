This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Signal Processing (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves simulations and proposes a phase rotation scheme, which could also place it in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
