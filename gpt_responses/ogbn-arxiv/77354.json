This involves analyzing spatio-temporal features and changes in the video. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the use of deep learning models and evaluation of performance could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves analyzing the security of surveillance videos, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
