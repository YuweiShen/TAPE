This problem is relevant to several practical MIMO communication scenarios, including FDD and TDD massive MIMO, cell-free/distributed massive MIMO, mmWave beam prediction, MIMO radar, and massive MIMO based positioning. The paper proposes to use deep neural networks to learn the channel-to-channel mapping function, which is typically unknown and hard to characterize analytically. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are all relevant to the problem of channel mapping and deep learning. The paper also discusses the potential applications of channel mapping in control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM), which are less relevant but still possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
