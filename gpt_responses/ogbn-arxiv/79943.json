This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) as the primary methodology used is articulated human pose estimation. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of pedestrian distraction, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed pipeline also involves tracking the articulated pose of a pedestrian, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The use of multimedia devices also falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and the issue of distraction is related to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
