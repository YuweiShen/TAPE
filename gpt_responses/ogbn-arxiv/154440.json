The use of multiple antennas and MIMO technology suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the study of optimal transmission strategies and achievable rate-energy regions involves system optimization and control, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
