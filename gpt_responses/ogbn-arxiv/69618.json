The paper specifically focuses on local models, which make decisions based on local information rather than non-local features. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP and related tasks. \n\nThe paper also uses deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with syntactic structures, which could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the same techniques are applied to visual parsing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
