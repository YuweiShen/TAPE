Additionally, the paper discusses the use of large-scale language models and knowledge distillation, which are topics that are often studied in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of generated examples, which could potentially fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.
