The use of deep neural networks for this task also suggests the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. The probabilistic method used to generate popularity-discriminable image pairs involves statistical inference, which could be classified under the statistics (cs.ST) or social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions optimizing the model for ranking consistency, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
