This paper presents a stemmer for Gujarati, which could be useful in information retrieval systems for this language.\n- cs.LG (Learning): Although this paper is not focused on machine learning, it does mention the use of a decision tree algorithm to generate the stemming rules. This could potentially fall under the scope of this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Stemming is a common technique used in natural language processing, which is a sub-field of AI. This paper presents a rule-based stemmer for Gujarati, which could be useful in AI applications involving this language.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are not directly related to the content of this paper.
