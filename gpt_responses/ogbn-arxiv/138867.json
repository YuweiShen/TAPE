Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also involves cryptographic techniques such as VRFs, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of committee sampling and shared coin algorithms involves randomness and probability, which could place the paper in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves word complexity and communication, which could place it in cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
