The paper also discusses the use of antipodal grasps, which is a common concept in robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with detecting grasp points in 3D point clouds, which is a common problem in computer vision. The paper also discusses the use of a large automatically labeled training set, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of a large automatically labeled training set to improve classification accuracy, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to detecting grasp points using knowledge of the geometry of a good grasp, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.ROB (Robotics and Control): The paper discusses the use of geometric parameters of a robot hand to detect grasp points, which is a common problem in robotics and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
