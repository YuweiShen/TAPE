Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new unsupervised and automatic re-ranking framework, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves distance computation and retrieval techniques, which are related to information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category.
