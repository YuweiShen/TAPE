Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the formalization of natural deduction, which is a topic that falls under the category of programming languages and compilers, hence cs.PL (Programming Languages). The tool NaDeA is based on the Isabelle proof assistant, which is a tool for automated reasoning and theorem proving, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation and exercises in NaDeA, which could fall under the category of educational technology, hence cs.ET (Education Technology) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
