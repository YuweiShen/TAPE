This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the use of sketches in program comprehension also has implications for Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper may also touch on Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) as sketches could potentially be used to identify vulnerabilities in code. Finally, the paper may also relate to Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) as it investigates the communication aspect of sketching in software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
