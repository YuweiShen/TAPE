Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes novel techniques for explaining individual model decisions and quantifying artifactual and poisoned classes, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses cleaning procedures for relieving data of artifacts and biases, which could fall under cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
