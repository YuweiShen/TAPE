The paper also focuses on using visual inputs, such as camera images, to learn and generalize robotic skills, which suggests the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a self-supervised model-based approach, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed method for control of robotic systems, which suggests the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
