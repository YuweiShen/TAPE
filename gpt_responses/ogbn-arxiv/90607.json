The use of confidence levels derived from softmax outputs is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses experimentation with architectures based on ResNet, which is a popular convolutional neural network architecture commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
