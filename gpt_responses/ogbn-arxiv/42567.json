This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the concept of bandwidth occupancy, which is related to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of closed-form expressions, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
