This involves training a multilayered attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units on a corpus of visualization specifications. The paper also discusses the challenges faced by users in creating effective visualizations using expressive grammars. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
