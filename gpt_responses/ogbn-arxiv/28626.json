The use of channel state information for transmit signal adaptation is a common technique in wireless networks, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a finite codebook design method, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). The use of beamforming, which is discussed in the paper, is a technique commonly used in multimedia communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the simulation results presented in the paper involve the comparison of different methods, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
