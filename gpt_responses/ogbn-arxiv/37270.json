Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses active learning methods, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The system presented in the paper learns to transform sentences into logical database queries, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
