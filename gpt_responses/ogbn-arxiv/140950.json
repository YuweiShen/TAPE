This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The method involves adding a penalization term to the decision function, which is a technique that has been used in other areas of machine learning such as reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the theoretical motivation behind the method, which suggests a connection to neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
