The paper also mentions the use of Gaussian error, which is a common statistical assumption in machine learning and could potentially place it in the cs.ST (Statistics) category. The paper also discusses the use of an \"over-parametrized\" model, which is a topic in deep learning and could potentially place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of an analytical solution for the pNML method, which is a topic in information theory and could potentially place it in the cs.IT (Information Theory) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
