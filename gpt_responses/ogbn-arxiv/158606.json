The paper discusses the use of proxy models to perform data selection tasks, which is a technique that is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science. However, given the focus on deep learning and the specific tasks evaluated in the paper (active learning and core-set selection), it is most likely that this paper would be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
