Information theory is concerned with the fundamental limits of communication and data processing, and this paper provides a lower bound on the mean square error of any estimator, which is a fundamental limit.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The channel model considered in the paper is motivated by applications such as multi-reference alignment and cryo-electron microscopy, which are common in computer vision and image processing. The paper also mentions the use of moment tensors, which are commonly used in computer vision for feature extraction.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the performance of different estimators for the group action channel, including the maximum likelihood estimator. Machine learning algorithms often involve estimating parameters from data, so this paper is relevant to the field of machine learning.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, but the problem of estimating a signal from multiple measurements is a common problem in network analysis. The lower bound on the mean square error could be useful for designing more accurate network estimation algorithms.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper does not focus on data structures or algorithms, but the problem of estimating a signal from multiple measurements is a computational problem that"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
