Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a software-defined networking (SDN) enabled framework, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses optimizing network resource usage, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses potential security issues, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
