The use of deep learning methods for these tasks also suggests a possible association with the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the KITTI driving dataset, which is commonly used in computer vision and robotics research, and has been featured in the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CVPR) conference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
