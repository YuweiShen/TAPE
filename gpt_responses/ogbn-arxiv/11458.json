This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and proposes a new architecture (cs.AI) for multi-human action recognition. Additionally, the paper deals with video data (cs.MM) and proposes a new approach for robust detection and recognition (cs.CR) of multiple human actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
