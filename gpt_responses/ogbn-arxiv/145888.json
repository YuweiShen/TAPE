The paper also discusses the impact of optimal ordering on the system performance, which can be related to the field of signal processing (cs.SI). The analysis of the computational complexity and energy efficiency of the proposed solution can be linked to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
