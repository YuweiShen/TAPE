Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of end-to-end training and optimization algorithms, which are topics in machine learning (LG, AI, NE). Finally, the paper focuses on image segmentation, which is a sub-topic of multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
