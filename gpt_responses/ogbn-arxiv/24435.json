This involves the use of model observers to mimic human observers and the application of classifiers such as support-vector-machine and deep neural network. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories of arXiv CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
