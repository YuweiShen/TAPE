The paper also proposes a multi-relay selection scheme based on energy thresholds, which is related to information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper investigates a wireless-powered cooperative network consisting of multiple relays, which is a networking problem. The proposed multi-relay selection scheme is also related to networking.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper models the charging/discharging behaviors of the finite-capacity battery at each relay as a finite-state Markov Chain, which is related to systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but the proposed scheme can be applied to multimedia transmission in wireless networks.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a heuristic approach to optimize the energy threshold for each relay, which involves computational methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
