The paper also uses stochastic approximation theory and ergodic theorems, which are topics in systems and control theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses convergence results, which is a topic in numerical analysis and optimization, making cs.NE (Numerical Analysis) a likely sub-category as well. Finally, the paper deals with Markov chains, which is a topic in probability theory and statistics, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
