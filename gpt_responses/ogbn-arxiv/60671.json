It also involves programming language concepts such as recursion and object-oriented programming, which could place it in the programming languages (cs.PL) category. The algorithm deals with graphs, which could place it in the data structures (cs.DS) category. The paper also involves software engineering concepts such as correctness and verification, which could place it in the software engineering (cs.SE) category.
