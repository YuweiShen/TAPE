The paper proposes a new approach for generating global explanations of neural networks, which involves explaining the landscape of predictions across subpopulations. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cybersecurity (cs.CR). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
