Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses model-agnostic and model-specific explanation methods, which are relevant to the broader field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper evaluates the explanations from a human perspective, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HCI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of explanations for justifying model predictions and investigating uncertain predictions, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
