This involves maximising a cheap-to-query acquisition function to determine the next location to evaluate. The paper is focused on machine learning and optimisation, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with control systems and optimisation, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves data analysis and optimisation, which suggests that it could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
