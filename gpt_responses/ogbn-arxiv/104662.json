It may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it involves the analysis of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the probability of coverage/outage. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as cellular networks are a type of social network. It may also fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) as the paper discusses the average rate achieved by a mobile user.
