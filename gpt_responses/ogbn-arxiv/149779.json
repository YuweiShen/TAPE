The use of semi-linear maps and non-commutative polynomial rings suggests a connection to algebraic structures and algorithms, which are relevant to the discrete structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.SD) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses encoding, decoding, and error detection methods, which are relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
