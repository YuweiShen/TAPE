Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the training procedure and optimization techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of cost volume processing, which is a common technique in robotics and autonomous systems, indicating that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the models on different datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
