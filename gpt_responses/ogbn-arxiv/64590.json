This technique is based on information theory principles and can be used for bandwidth efficient channel estimation without ambiguity. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with the problem of residual self-interference (SI) cancellation in the digital baseband of a FD communication system. The proposed technique is used for estimating the SI and communication channels in such a system, and is evaluated using simulation results in terms of MSE of channel estimation error and bit error rate. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a new technique for estimating the SI and communication channels in a FD communication system, which involves adding a constant real number to each constellation point of a conventional modulation constellation to yield asymmetric shifted modulation constellations with respect to the origin. This technique is based on signal processing principles and can be used for bandwidth efficient channel estimation without ambiguity. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of residual self-interference (SI) cancellation in the digital baseband of a FD communication system.
