Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper uses majorization theory as a tool, which falls under the category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also discusses the near-far effect, which is related to signal processing and falls under the category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper provides insights into the practical design of training-based multiuser MIMO systems, which falls under the category cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
