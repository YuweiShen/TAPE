This involves joint transmission of signals from multiple BSs to all UEs, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses power allocation schemes and outage probability, which are related to system optimization (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed scheme has implications for large-scale networks and communication systems, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
