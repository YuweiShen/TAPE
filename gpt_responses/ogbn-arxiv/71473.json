It may also belong to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category as it discusses the security implications of fingerprint representations. The use of deep learning techniques suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the benchmarking against commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software development kits (SDKs) suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
