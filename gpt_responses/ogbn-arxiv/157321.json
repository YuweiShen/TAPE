It could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it deals with identifying devices from their network traffic. The paper also introduces a novel Deep Complex-valued Neural Network (DCN) for modeling raw RF signals, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions open air captures and provides guidelines for future explorations, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
