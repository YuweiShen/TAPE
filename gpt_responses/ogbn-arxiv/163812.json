The use of game theory to understand the trade-offs involved in defending against stealthy attacks suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-category. The practical setting of limited resources and asymmetric feedback structure could also make the paper relevant to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. The use of algorithms to find optimal strategies suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the focus on protecting a system of multiple nodes suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
