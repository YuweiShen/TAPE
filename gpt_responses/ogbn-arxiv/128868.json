The proposed framework is based on deep reinforcement learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The framework is designed to ensure safety and reliability in autonomous vehicles, which is a key aspect of control systems (cs.SY). The practical case study involves comparing the performance of two collision avoidance mechanisms, which may involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
