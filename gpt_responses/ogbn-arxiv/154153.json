Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning (ML) techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (ML) or cs.LG (learning). The use of a multi-task module and a confidence estimation network also indicates that the paper could be relevant to cs.AI (artificial intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the integration of shadow confidence maps into tasks such as image classification and biometric measurements, which suggests that it could be related to cs.IR (information retrieval) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
