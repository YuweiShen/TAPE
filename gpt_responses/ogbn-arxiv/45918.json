The paper also introduces lightweight modules suitable for mobile models, which suggests a focus on efficiency and optimization, making cs.AI another likely sub-category. The use of elementwise square operators may also suggest a focus on neural networks and optimization (cs.NE), and the use of these operators in different types of modules may suggest a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
