This falls under the domain of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper involves feature extraction and selection, which is a common problem in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the paper deals with processing and analyzing large amounts of financial data. Finally, the paper involves the use of classifiers, which is a fundamental concept in Data Science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
