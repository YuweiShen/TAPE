This task is commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) communities. The paper proposes a novel method that leverages external knowledge to improve weakly supervised grounding, which is a problem commonly studied in machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG) communities.
