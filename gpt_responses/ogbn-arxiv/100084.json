The paper also discusses the combination of different election schemes, which involves data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AI). The paper also mentions resistance constructions, which are related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the computational infeasibility of electoral control, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
