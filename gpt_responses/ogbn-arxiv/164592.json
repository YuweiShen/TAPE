Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a novel model for local feature aggregation in CNN networks, which involves weighting schemes and bilinear coding, indicating that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with feature interactions, which suggests that it may belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
