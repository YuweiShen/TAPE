The paper proposes a novel solution to alleviate the straggler/failure problem that exploits existing efficient partitioning properties of the data, which is a technique commonly used in the fields of data structures, databases, and machine learning. The paper also validates its approach through extensive experiments on the TPC-H dataset, which is a common benchmark dataset used in the fields of databases and distributed computing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS, cs.DB, cs.DC, cs.SI, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
