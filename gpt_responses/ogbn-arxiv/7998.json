The concept of monotonicity is also relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves proving the non-existence of certain embeddings, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the problem of simultaneous embeddings can be related to distributed computing (cs.DC) or complexity theory (cs.CC). However, since the paper focuses on geometric embeddings, we consider cs.CG to be the most likely category, followed by cs.DS and cs.DM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
