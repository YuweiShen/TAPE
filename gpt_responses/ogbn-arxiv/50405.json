This involves splitting a large neural network into two wirelessly connected segments to reduce communication costs and privacy leakage. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning framework for received power prediction.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper utilizes camera images as inputs for the machine learning framework.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses communication efficiency and privacy preservation in the proposed framework.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper involves wirelessly connected segments and communication costs.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper combines camera images and radio frequency signals for received power prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
