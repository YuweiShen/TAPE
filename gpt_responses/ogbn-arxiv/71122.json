The paper also discusses the use of machine learning tools like deep-nets, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel perturbation robust topological representation, which suggests that it may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper applies the proposed representation to three different applications, including non-linear dynamical modeling, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
