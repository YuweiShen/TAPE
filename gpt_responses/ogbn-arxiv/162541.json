This is motivated by recent successful applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in tasks like compressive sensing, denoising and robustness against adversarial examples. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.IT (Information Theory)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
