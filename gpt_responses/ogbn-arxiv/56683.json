This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on the assessment of technical skills for minimally invasive or robot-assisted procedures. This indicates a strong connection to the field of robotics.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method uses deep learning-based video classification, which falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an automatic, objective skill assessment method using deep learning, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis of surgical video data, which can be considered as a form of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
