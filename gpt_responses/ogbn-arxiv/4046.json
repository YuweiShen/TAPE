The use of pure-strategy Nash equilibrium as a solution concept suggests that the paper also belongs to the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT). The computational complexity characterizations and algorithms for solving the problem of identifying the most influential individuals suggest that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
