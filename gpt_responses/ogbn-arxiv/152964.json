Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel training method for CNN models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG - Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of objectness potential, which is a concept from artificial intelligence (cs.AI - Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of annotations and labeling, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL - Computation and Language). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark, which is a dataset commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM - Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
