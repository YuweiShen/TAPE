The paper also discusses the importance of identifiability in linear mixture models, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI, cs.IT). Additionally, the paper presents numerical results on synthetic and real data, which suggests a focus on computational methods and data analysis (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
