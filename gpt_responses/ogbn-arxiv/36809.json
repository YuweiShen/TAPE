The paper also discusses the use of Toeplitz asymptotic eigenvalue distribution theorem, which is a topic related to linear algebra and matrix theory (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper provides a concrete example of the rate-distortion function for a nonstationary autoregressive process, which could be relevant to multimedia applications (cs.MM).
