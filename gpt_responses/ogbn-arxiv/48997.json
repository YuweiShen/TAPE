This is a core topic in the field of dynamical systems.\n2. cs.SI (Statistical Learning): The paper discusses the use of kernel-mean embeddings and maximum mean discrepancy for evaluating the predictive accuracy of estimated operators. These are common techniques in statistical learning.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of data-driven methods such as dynamic mode decomposition and kernel-mean embeddings for analyzing nonlinear systems is a common theme in machine learning.\n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper develops a novel Krylov subspace method for estimating the lifted representation of nonlinear dynamical systems with random noise using finite data. This is a numerical analysis problem.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper addresses the problem of estimating the lifted representation of nonlinear dynamical systems with random noise, which is a key problem in the field of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
