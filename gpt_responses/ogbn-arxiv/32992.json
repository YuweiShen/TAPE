The proposed method involves semi-supervised learning (SSL) and label noise detection, which are both topics in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the effects of different label noise distributions, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of linear probes to study the effects of label noise memorization, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
