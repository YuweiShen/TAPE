This involves the use of procedures, which are sequences of policies defined by the combination of previously learned skills. The paper also discusses the use of goal-directed exploration strategies. These topics are all related to robotics and machine learning, which are covered by the sub-categories of cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
