This involves accommodating for autoregressive noise accumulation during training, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and falls under the category of \"deep learning\" or \"neural networks\". The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques for motion synthesis, which falls under the category of \"computer vision\". Additionally, the paper discusses the ability to generate different styles of motion, which could be related to \"artificial intelligence\" or \"graphics\". Finally, the paper mentions the ability to generate continuous frames of motion, which could be related to \"robotics\". Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.GR, and cs.RO, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
