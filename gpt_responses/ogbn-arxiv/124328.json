It also involves the use of CNN visualization models, which is a common technique in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as CNN is a type of machine learning algorithm and the paper discusses how CNN separates different classes with learned inter-class knowledge. \n\nThe Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper involves understanding how an object class is represented in the fully-connected layers of CNN, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence. \n\nThe Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is another possibility as CNN is a type of neural network and the paper discusses how intra-class knowledge is represented in a hierarchical and ensemble way. \n\nFinally, the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is a possibility as the paper discusses style-based image retrieval and style-based object completion, which are applications related to multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
