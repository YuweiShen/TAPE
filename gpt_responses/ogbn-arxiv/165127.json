The proposed method involves the use of deep neural networks (NNs), which is a popular technique in CV research. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of a text recognizer, which suggests that the work may fall under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). \n\nThe paper deals with text detection and recognition, which are tasks related to natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper mentions the use of an ensemble of multiple text detectors, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (ML) to improve performance. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the problem of extracting text from images, which is a task related to multimedia (MM) processing. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
