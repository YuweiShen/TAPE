The paper also introduces a new type of infinite word called a zigzag word, which can be seen as a data structure with forward and backward repetitions, and can be analyzed using techniques from data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses coding theory to analyze the growth of morphic words, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper uses combinatorial and graph-theoretic arguments to prove its main results, which are techniques commonly used in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
