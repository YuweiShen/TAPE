This involves exploiting the switching noise frequencies of different computers to achieve simultaneous data exfiltration from multiple computers using only one receiver. The paper also discusses possible defenses against such attacks. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are also possible categories as the paper involves communication over a building's power network and the development of a new system for data exfiltration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
