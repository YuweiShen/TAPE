The algorithms are designed to solve basic problems such as colouring, degree computation, and MIS, which are typical topics in the area of Distributed Systems (cs.DS). The use of beeps as a means of communication is a unique feature of the model, which could also place the paper in the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of probability and collision detection, which are topics in Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
