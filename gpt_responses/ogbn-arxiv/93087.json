The paper also introduces a multi-dimensional array approach, which is a data structure commonly used in computer science (cs.DS). The paper discusses the computing capacity of network codes, which is a topic in coding theory and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper applies the improved upper bound to the problem of computing a vector-linear function over a network, which involves distributed computing and algorithms (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
