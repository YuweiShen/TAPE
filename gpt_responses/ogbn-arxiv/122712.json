Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces new techniques for decoders, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper explores prediction artifacts, which could be related to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
