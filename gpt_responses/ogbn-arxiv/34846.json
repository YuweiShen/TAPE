Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also deals with reliability and latency, which are key performance metrics in communication systems, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses interference cancellation, which is a common topic in the security and cryptography community, indicating that it could also be classified as cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper mentions optimization, which is a topic that falls under the umbrella of machine learning and artificial intelligence, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
