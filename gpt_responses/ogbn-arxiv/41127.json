Specifically, the paper focuses on the use of Map-Reduce for this task, which is a distributed computing paradigm commonly used in big data applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary category for papers on this topic. \n\nOther possible sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), which is relevant because the paper is about distributed computing, and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which is relevant because the paper discusses the use of Nystr\u00f6m approximation and gradient-based techniques. \n\nAdditionally, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are possible sub-categories because the paper mentions benchmark datasets, which could include image or video data commonly used in computer vision applications, and because kernel machines are often used in data mining and pattern recognition tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
