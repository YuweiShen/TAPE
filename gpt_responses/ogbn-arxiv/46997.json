This involves the use of pre-trained image-captioning network models and deep learning frameworks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with visual stimuli, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the use of regression models to learn the relationship between brain activity and deep-layer image features suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves the use of deep learning frameworks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Learning). Finally, the paper involves the generation of natural language sentences, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
