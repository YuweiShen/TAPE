The paper also mentions that traditional database design is not used in practice, which suggests that there may be issues with software engineering (cs.SE) practices in this area. The authors also suggest that database design could benefit from advances in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the need for better search and retrieval techniques (cs.IR) to help researchers find relevant information on database design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
