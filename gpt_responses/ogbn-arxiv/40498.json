The paper also discusses the use of domain randomization, which is a technique used in machine learning to improve the transfer of policies from simulation to the real world, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of simulation environments, which is a common tool in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of parameters to improve the performance of the trained policies, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
