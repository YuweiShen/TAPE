The paper also discusses the importance of distinguishing between cultural and linguistic factors in semantic change, which suggests a focus on social and cultural aspects of language use. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP research. Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DL (Deep Learning), as these fields are also relevant to the computational analysis of language and culture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
