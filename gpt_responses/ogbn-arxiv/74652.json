The paper also presents a new construction method for linear codes, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents a trace representation of linear codes, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
