Therefore, it is likely to belong to the database (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the classic philosophy of substitution and correlation in logic and programming languages, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper aims to fix ambiguities and set a safe formal base for further extensions of the language, which indicates that it may also be relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
