This makes it likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category, as well as Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of tailored high-level RPA Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to adjust the functioning of the robots, which suggests a focus on Software Engineering (cs.SE) as well. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of interactive and collaborative ML in the cloud, which could indicate a focus on Machine Learning (cs.LG) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
