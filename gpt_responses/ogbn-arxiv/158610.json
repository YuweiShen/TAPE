Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses technical implications and the need for changes on the browser end, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper addresses privacy concerns, which could place it in cs.CY (Computers and Society) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of the proposed solution in terms of latency and availability, which could place it in cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
