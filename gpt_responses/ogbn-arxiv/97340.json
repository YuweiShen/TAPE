The paper also mentions the use of MRD codes in public key cryptosystems, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the invariants of MRD codes and their distinguishers, which are topics related to cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of field extensions, which is a topic related to algebra and number theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses decoding algorithms for MRD codes, which is a topic related to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
