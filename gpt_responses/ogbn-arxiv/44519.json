The proposed approach involves deep metric learning and anomaly detection, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of generalization in real scenarios, which is a topic related to computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper uses a large dataset for experiments, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel loss function and regularization technique, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
