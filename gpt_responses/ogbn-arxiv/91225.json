This could fall under the sub-category of Security and Privacy (cs.CR). The paper also focuses on speaker identification on audio samples, which could fall under the sub-category of Sound (cs.SD) or Speech Recognition (cs.SI). The use of machine learning models and the implementation of defenses such as prediction obfuscation, defensive distillation or adversarial training, could also fall under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
