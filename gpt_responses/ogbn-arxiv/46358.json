The proposed method involves using oriented boxes instead of axis-aligned boxes, which requires a more sophisticated approach to object detection and localization. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of oriented boxes involves geometric reasoning and manipulation, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on two datasets, which suggests that it may also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
