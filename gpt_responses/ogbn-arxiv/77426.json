The paper proposes a nonconvex optimization algorithm to solve this problem, which involves minimizing a nonconvex quadratic loss function via vanilla gradient descent, following a tailored spectral initialization. The paper provides theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary area of focus for the paper. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), which are all relevant to the problem of matrix factorization and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
