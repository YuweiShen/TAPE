The systems are designed to capture different levels of computability, such as polynomial space and various levels of recursive time and space, which are topics in complexity theory (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The use of logic and axiomatic systems also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
