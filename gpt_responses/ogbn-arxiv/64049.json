This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of detection algorithms to reduce computational complexity, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper analyzes the performance of the proposed system over measured indoor channels, which falls under the domain of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
