The paper specifically focuses on the stability of groups of highly cited publications with respect to changes in the citation window length. This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), cybernetics (cs.CY), social and information networks (cs.SI), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given the emphasis on bibliometrics and citation analysis, cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
