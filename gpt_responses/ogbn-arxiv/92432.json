The method involves using a model of measurement error, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions an outlier correspondence rejection scheme, which is a technique used in both computer vision and robotics (cs.CV and cs.RO). The method involves integrating knowledge about the physics of the sensor, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
