Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also presents approximation algorithms and complexity analysis, which are typical topics in cs.AL (Computational Complexity) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the algorithms, which could be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
