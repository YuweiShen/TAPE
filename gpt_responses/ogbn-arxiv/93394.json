The paper also addresses the issue of conditioning distributional properties, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the case studies in algorithmic fairness and robustness suggest a potential application in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
