This falls under the category of machine learning, which is covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. Specifically, the paper focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters, which is a common problem in deep learning. This suggests that the paper is most likely to belong to the sub-category of \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning), which covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms for learning from data. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the use of distributed systems and parallelization techniques to speed up the training process. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of \"cs.DC\" (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), which covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms for distributed computing. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of metaoptimization algorithms, which are used to optimize the hyperparameters of the learning algorithm itself. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which cover topics related to the design and analysis of intelligent systems. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of deep learning techniques to learn policies for playing Atari games. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of \"cs.CV"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
