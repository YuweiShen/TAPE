The use of Isabelle/UTP as a proof framework also supports this categorization.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper focuses on model-based design and verification of reactive systems, which is a key area of software engineering. The use of contracts as a means of specifying behavioural assumptions and guarantees of components is also a common practice in software engineering.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper presents a language for expression and composition of contracts, which is a key aspect of programming languages. The use of Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) also supports this categorization.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper presents a formal theory for reactive design contracts, which involves the use of automata and formal languages to specify and reason about reactive systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper focuses on the modelling and verification of reactive systems, which is a key area of systems and control. The use of discrete time, continuous time, and hybrid computational models also supports this categorization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
