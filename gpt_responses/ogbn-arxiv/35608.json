This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a novel training method, which involves ensemble learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the issue of annotation noise, which is a common problem in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
