The use of deep learning methods also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The unsupervised learning framework proposed in the paper could also place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of multiple target views and motion dynamics could suggest that it belongs to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the view-adversarial training method proposed in the paper could also suggest that it belongs to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
