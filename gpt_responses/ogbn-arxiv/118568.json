Group testing is a classic problem in computer science, and the gapped version of it has been studied extensively in recent years. The paper presents a new quantum algorithm for this problem, which improves upon the best classical algorithm. This makes cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) likely categories. \n\nThe paper also presents a quantum algorithm for junta testing, which is a well-studied problem in theoretical computer science. This makes cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely categories. \n\nOverall, cs.CC and cs.DS are the most likely categories, followed by cs.IT, cs.DM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
