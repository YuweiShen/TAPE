The use of codes for mitigating the effects of straggling servers suggests that the paper is likely to be related to information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of matrix multiplication and submatrices suggests that the paper may also be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The consideration of deadlines and performance metrics suggests that the paper may also be related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
