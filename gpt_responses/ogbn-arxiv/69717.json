This involves information theoretic concepts such as channel capacity and diversity order. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the use of NOMA as a potential multiple access technology for efficient spectrum utilization in 5G wireless networks. This involves networking and internet architecture concepts such as wireless communication protocols and network optimization. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper presents a cooperative relaying system using NOMA and analyzes its performance in terms of spectral efficiency and diversity. This involves communication and networking concepts such as signal processing and network performance evaluation. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper presents a system-level analysis of a cooperative relaying system using NOMA with receive diversity. This involves systems and control concepts such as system modeling and performance analysis. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not directly relate to multimedia, but it may indirectly impact multimedia applications by improving the efficiency and reliability of wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
