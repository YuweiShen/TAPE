The proposed method involves sparsity-based correction of piecewise exponential and smooth protuberance transients, which can be formulated as an unconstrained convex optimization problem and solved by majorization-minimization (MM) method. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.MM (Mathematical Software)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
