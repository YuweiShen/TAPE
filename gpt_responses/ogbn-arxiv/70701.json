The use of the independent cascade model and the focus on learning the set of \"best influencers\" suggests that cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is the most likely sub-category. The use of UCB-based algorithms and the analysis of regret bounds suggest that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the challenges of limited feedback and combinatorial action space, which are relevant to cs.SOC (Computational Social Science) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the use of linear generalization and real-world experiments suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
