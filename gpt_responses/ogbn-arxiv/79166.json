The use of a MIMO switch also involves multiple antennas and signal processing, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses scheduling and optimization for fair switching, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
