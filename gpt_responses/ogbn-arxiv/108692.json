The proposed framework involves techniques such as correspondence space voting and transformation space mapping, which are commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper introduces a novel cost matrix formulation, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) who work on developing new cost functions for optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
