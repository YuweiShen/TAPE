The use of typed-norms suggests a type-based approach, which is also related to programming languages. The paper mentions that programs written in different programming paradigms can be automatically translated, which suggests that the paper may also be related to formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper presents a formalized rule-based representation, which suggests that it may also be related to cryptography (cs.CR) as rule-based systems are often used in security protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
