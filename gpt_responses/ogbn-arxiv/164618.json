It also involves adapting visual-semantic embeddings for zero-shot learning, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes background-aware approaches for learning robust detectors, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of semantic labels and auxiliary data for dense sampling also involves natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the empirical evaluation involves using standard detection datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
