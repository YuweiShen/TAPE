Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of system and communication parameters on end-users, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper focuses on millimeter-wave systems, which is a subfield of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the security aspects of the proposed system, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of the proposed system on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
