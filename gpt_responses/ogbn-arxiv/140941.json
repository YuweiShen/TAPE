The paper discusses the limitations of current AES methods and proposes a new approach that integrates the advantages of both feature-engineered and end-to-end AES models. This work involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and data analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
