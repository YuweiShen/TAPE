Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning models for clustering, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised learning and minimum supervision, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of hierarchical frameworks, which suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
