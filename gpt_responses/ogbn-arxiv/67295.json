This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper addresses the issue of confirming correctness of modifications made to an evolving program, which is a key concern in software engineering. The proposed method can be seen as a tool for aiding software engineers in this task.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper leverages Datalog, a logic programming language, for performing the static analysis. This falls under the domain of logic in computer science.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves analyzing data-flow edges in programs, which can be seen as a problem in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the issue of thread synchronization can have implications for security and cryptography in concurrent programs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
