The paper also discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of atrous convolution is a specific technique that falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses implementation details and training experiences, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
