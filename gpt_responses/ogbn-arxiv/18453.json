The paper also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of uncertainty estimates and adaptive thin volumes also suggests that this paper could be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the reconstruction of scenes, which could make it relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
