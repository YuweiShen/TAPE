The paper proposes a new data structure called parameterized position heaps and presents a right-to-left online construction algorithm for it. The paper also provides a pattern matching algorithm for the constructed data structure. The problem and the proposed solution are related to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational complexity (cs.CC), information retrieval (cs.IR), and computational geometry (cs.CG). However, since the paper focuses on the design and analysis of a new data structure and its algorithmic properties, cs.DS is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
