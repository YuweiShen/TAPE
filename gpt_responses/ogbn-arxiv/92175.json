It specifically focuses on a 4-node network with cooperation to mitigate interference, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the relationship between the derived bound and similar bounds for channel models including cognitive nodes, which relates to machine learning (cs.MM) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
