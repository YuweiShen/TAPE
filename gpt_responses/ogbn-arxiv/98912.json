This involves using an entropic criterion to estimate the uncertainty of each cluster, introducing a novel ensemble-driven cluster validity measure, and presenting a locally weighted co-association matrix. These techniques are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), data mining (cs.DM), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
