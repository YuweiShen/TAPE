It also mentions a refinement of a previous result, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of a simple technique could also suggest a focus on practical applications, which could fall under the categories of social and information networks (cs.SI) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the mention of a third order term could suggest a focus on mathematical modeling and analysis, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
