The use of linear non-coherent network coding also suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the capacity of the network to generate a secret key, which is a topic in information theory and communication complexity (cs.SI, cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
