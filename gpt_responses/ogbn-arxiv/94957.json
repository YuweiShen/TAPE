It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves the extraction of trends from textual data. Additionally, the use of scalable algorithms suggests a connection to cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and the ever-increasing number of born-digital documents points towards cs.CY (Computers and Society). Finally, the comparison of trends across different corpora could be related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
