Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the overhead and scalability of the routing protocol, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The use of a smart forwarding plane and the investigation of packet delivery delay could also relate to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper uses experimental methods to evaluate the performance of the routing protocol, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
