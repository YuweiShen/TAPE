It proposes a framework for eliciting fairness constraints from individuals or panels of judges and enforcing them algorithmically. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses a behavioral study, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the COMPAS criminal recidivism dataset, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
