The paper presents a tool called Datamaran that can automatically identify field and record endpoints, separate structured parts from unstructured noise, and extract structured relational datasets from log datasets at scale with high accuracy. This work involves techniques from database systems (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), software engineering (cs.SE), and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
