The paper also discusses the challenges and complexities of developing and extending type systems, which could fall under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of graphs and modeling also suggests a possible fit for the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new type system feature, interval types, which could fall under the Theory of Computation (cs.THEORY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the expressiveness of interval types, which could also fit under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
