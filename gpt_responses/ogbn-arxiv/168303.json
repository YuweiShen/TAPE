The use of Farey sequences in number theory to solve the design problem suggests a possible connection to optimization and algorithms (cs.OH). The discussion of diversity gain and error performance is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and network theory (cs.NT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
