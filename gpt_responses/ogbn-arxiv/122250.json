Additionally, the use of tracklets and conditioning the object detection on them suggests a machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG) approach. The proposed method also involves optimization and modeling of object trajectories, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
