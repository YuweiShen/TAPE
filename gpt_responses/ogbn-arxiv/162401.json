Additionally, the paper discusses optimization techniques for neural network inference, which could fall under the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. The use of machine learning algorithms and optimization methods also suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper's focus on optimizing neural network queries and reducing computational costs could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses potential security implications of video analysis, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
