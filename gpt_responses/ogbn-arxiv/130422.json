The proposed solution involves the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which are a type of hardware-based security technology commonly used in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the design and implementation of a hybrid system, which involves both software and hardware components, making it relevant to the field of software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of side channel leakages, which is a common concern in the field of cryptography (cs.CY). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to fully homomorphic encryption, which is a topic of interest in the field of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
