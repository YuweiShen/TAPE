The method involves moment-based Gaussian approximations, which is a technique used in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG, cs.AI). The motivating problem for the method is Kalman filtering, which is a common topic in control systems and robotics (cs.SY, cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
