This topic falls under the intersection of information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses metrics based on error rate functions for commonly used modulation schemes, which could fall under machine learning and statistics (cs.MS) or signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper investigates diversity combining schemes, relay networks, and signal detection over fading channels with non-Gaussian additive noise, which could fall under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
