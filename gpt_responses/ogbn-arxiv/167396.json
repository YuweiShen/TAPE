The paper focuses on developing a new algorithm that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies using a divide-and-conquer structure with an embedded localized module. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, since the paper deals with a real-world problem and uses data analysis, the categories cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
