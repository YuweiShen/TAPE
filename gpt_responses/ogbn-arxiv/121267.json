The algorithms are based on new insights into the structure of Boolean functions, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category. The algorithms also involve techniques from data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG), which are likely to be relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
