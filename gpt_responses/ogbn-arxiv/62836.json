The construction of such codes involves the use of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DC) to efficiently encode and decode the information. The paper also discusses the redundancy required for the code, which is a measure of the trade-off between error correction and storage space, making it relevant to the sub-category of storage systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents a new construction that improves upon previous results, which is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
