The use of hints to improve the regret bounds is a novel approach, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC) in the analysis of the algorithms and lower bounds."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
