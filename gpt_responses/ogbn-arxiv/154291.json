The paper proposes a novel tracking framework that utilizes re-identification (Re-ID) model with human pose information considered, and tracklet association using the proposed fused tracking feature. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper deals with multi-media data, cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper also deals with the security aspect of multi-camera tracking, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
