The use of fly-automata, which are a type of automata theory, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the concept of clique-width, which is a graph parameter studied in the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's title includes the term \"fly automata\", which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
