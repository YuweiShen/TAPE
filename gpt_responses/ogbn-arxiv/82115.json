The games studied in the paper are based on flows, which suggests a connection to network optimization (cs.NI) and graph algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the existence and computation of equilibria in matrix games, which could be relevant to social choice theory (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
