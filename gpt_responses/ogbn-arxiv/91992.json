The paper also mentions the use of local models to simplify the global model, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). The experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that the proposed method is effective, which is a common evaluation metric in neural networks (cs.NE). Overall, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data science (cs.DS), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
