Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as ontology citation can be seen as a form of information retrieval. Software engineering (cs.SE) is another possible category as ontologies are often used in software development. Finally, computational linguistics (cs.CL) is a less likely category, but still relevant as ontologies can be used in natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
