The authors propose a system that uses machine learning techniques to detect anomalous content on a website, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The system also analyzes the HTML code and visual differences between legitimate and phishing pages, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the system can be installed as part of a web application firewall, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
