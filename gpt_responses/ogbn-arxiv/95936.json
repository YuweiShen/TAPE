The use of multi-modal MRI data and the proposed architecture for processing it also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the use of optimization techniques and the proposed architecture suggest a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
