It may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as it uses graph topology to detect fraudulent blocks. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent users. The paper also mentions sub-quadratic time complexity, which suggests it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
