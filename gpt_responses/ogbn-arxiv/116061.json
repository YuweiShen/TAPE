This involves the use of backscatter communication, which is a technique commonly used in information theory and wireless communication (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the potential for Internet connectivity for implanted devices (cs.NI) and presents proof-of-concepts for previously infeasible applications, such as a contact lens form-factor antenna prototype and an implantable neural recording interface (cs.EM, cs.AR). Finally, the paper involves the use of hardware prototypes and experimentation (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
