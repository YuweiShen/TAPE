The paper proposes a new method for detecting OOD data based on the total correlation of representations in flow-based models and VAEs. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
