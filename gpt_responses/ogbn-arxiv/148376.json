Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), followed by cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also includes results on upper bounds and forbidden subgraph characterizations, which suggest possible relevance to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
