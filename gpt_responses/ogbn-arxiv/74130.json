Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the treewidth-based algorithms for efficient computation of maximum-ink PEDs and SPEDs, which falls under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper establishes the NP-hardness of ink maximization for PEDs of 4-plane graphs, which is related to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
