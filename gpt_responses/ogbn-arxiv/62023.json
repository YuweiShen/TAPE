This involves the use of algorithms and data structures to efficiently allocate curing resources. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with epidemics on graphs, which is a topic related to social and information networks. The paper also discusses the impact of the graph structure on the efficiency of the curing policy. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a policy for controlling the spread of epidemics, which is related to systems and control. The paper also discusses the impact of the budget of curing resources on the efficiency of the policy. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the expected time until the extinction of the epidemic, which is related to information theory. The paper also discusses the impact of the CutWidth of the graph on the efficiency of the policy. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the spread of epidemics on graphs, which is related to networking and internet architecture. The paper also discusses the impact of the graph structure on the efficiency of the curing policy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
