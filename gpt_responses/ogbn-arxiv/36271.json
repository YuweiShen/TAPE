This is a key concept in information theory, and the paper uses atomic norm minimization to enhance sparsity. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with channel estimation for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as high-speed wireless communication and video streaming. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a channel estimation method for mmWave systems that employ generalized spatial modulation. This is a technique used in wireless networks to improve spectral efficiency and reduce interference. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with channel estimation for mmWave systems, which are commonly used in wireless networks. The proposed method could potentially improve the performance of these networks. \n5. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a channel estimation method for mmWave systems that employs hybrid analog and digital beamforming. This is a signal processing technique used in wireless communication to improve the quality of the received signal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
