The paper specifically focuses on the noncoherent MIMO block Rayleigh fading channel, which is a subfield of wireless communication. The optimization problems and solutions presented in the paper involve mathematical analysis and optimization techniques, which are common in the fields of information theory, communication theory, and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.COMM (Communication), and cs.SI (Signal Processing). Additionally, the paper involves some aspects of networked systems (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.MA) in terms of optimizing the input constellation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
