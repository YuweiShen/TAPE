The use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) is a popular approach in this area, and the paper specifically focuses on using HMMs to define and efficiently calculate the weighting of expert predictions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI) concepts, which are relevant to the use of HMMs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
