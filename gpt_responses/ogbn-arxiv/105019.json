Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are the most likely categories. The paper also involves data structures and algorithms for PIR, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another likely category. The paper also discusses the capacity of PIR, which is a measure of the efficiency of PIR schemes, and this suggests cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
