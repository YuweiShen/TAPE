The use of proxies to increase participation is a common solution in voting theory, which is also studied in cs.GT. The paper also considers situations where voters strategically choose whether to participate, which is a topic in algorithmic game theory (cs.GT). The paper uses metric spaces to model the voters' opinions, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper provides empirical results on simulated and real preference data, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
