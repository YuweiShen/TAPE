The paper deals with multi-hop question answering in the open-domain setting, which is a problem that falls under the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The paper proposes a new sub-problem of open-domain multi-hop QA, which involves recognizing the bridge from the context of a set of start passages with a reading comprehension model. This problem is closely related to several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
