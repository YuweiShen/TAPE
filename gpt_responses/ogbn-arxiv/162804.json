This falls under the domain of software engineering, which is concerned with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. \n\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the criticality of selecting an appropriate ERP system and the potential consequences of selecting an inappropriate one. This falls under the domain of computers and society, which is concerned with the social and ethical implications of computing technologies. \n\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper evaluates candidate ERP products according to both functional and non-functional requirements, which involves data management and storage. This falls under the domain of databases, which is concerned with the design, implementation, and management of databases. \n\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an evaluation methodology based on 0-1 linear programming and MACBETH technique to elaborate multi-criteria performance expressions. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, which is concerned with the development of intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. \n\n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the importance of considering the anticipated fitness of ERP solutions after the optimal resolution of a set of identified mismatches, which involves the interaction between humans and computers.
