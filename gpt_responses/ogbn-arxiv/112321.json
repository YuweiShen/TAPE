The proposed approach involves deep neural networks (DNNs), which is a common topic in the machine learning (LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the benefits of the proposed approach for power and latency constrained IoT applications, which falls under the networked systems (NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) processing, as it deals with compressing and transmitting images over a wireless channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
