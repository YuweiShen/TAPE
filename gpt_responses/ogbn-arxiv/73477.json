This falls under the scope of natural language processing, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper focuses on the use of Active Learning, a type of machine learning, in legal document review. The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of different Active Learning strategies. This falls under the scope of CS.LG.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of machine learning in document review, which is a common application of information retrieval. The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of different Active Learning strategies in this context.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of machine learning in the legal domain, which has implications for the intersection of technology and society. The paper also discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of using Active Learning in legal document review.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not directly discuss cryptography or security, it does touch on the topic of data privacy and confidentiality in the legal domain. This could potentially fall under the scope of CS.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
