The focus on function computation in collocated networks suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of single-letter information measures and the exploration of scaling laws suggest that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
