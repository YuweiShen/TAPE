The paper also models the memory effect of the energy harvester circuit using a Markov reward chain, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper proposes an optimization algorithm based on sequential quadratic programming, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also employs a deep neural network to model the Markov chain evolution, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents numerical results that involve simulations, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
