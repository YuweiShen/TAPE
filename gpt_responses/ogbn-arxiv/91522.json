The use of approximation algorithms and evaluation oracles suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves the use of continuous extensions and constraints, which are common in computational complexity (cs.CC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
