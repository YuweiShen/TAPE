This makes it likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the different levels of abstraction involved in concurrent programming, which could place it in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. The paper also touches on the role of theoretical research in developing programming abstractions, which could place it in the Operating Systems (cs.OS) category. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of changing the working framework and perspective, which could place it in the Architecture (cs.AR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
