The use of coresets for kernel regression is also a machine learning technique. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a compressed data set structure (coresets) that can be used as a proxy for the original data, which is a data structure. The paper also discusses the efficiency of constructing these coresets, which is related to algorithmic efficiency. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the evaluation of a kernel on a data set, which is a numerical operation. The use of coresets for kernel regression is also a numerical analysis technique. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, kernel regression is a common tool for analyzing network data, such as social networks. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, kernel regression is a common tool for image processing and computer vision applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
