Additionally, the paper proposes a solution that exploits machine-learning-based techniques to optimize the orchestration and monitoring processes, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the impact of monitoring loads on the performance of MANO systems, which could place it in the sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
