Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is a likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a modification to the architecture of recurrent neural networks to improve their ability to learn longer-term patterns, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the proposed model in language modeling experiments, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as recurrent neural networks are commonly used in image and video processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
