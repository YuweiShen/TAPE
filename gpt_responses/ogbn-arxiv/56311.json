The proposed method uses neural networks to perform the detection and calibration, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the trade-off between speed and accuracy, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments involve evaluating the performance of the method on image datasets, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with detecting faces in unconstrained environments, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
