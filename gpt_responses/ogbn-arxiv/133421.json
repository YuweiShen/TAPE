Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the resiliency of the protocol against Byzantine failures, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also mentions the use of oracles, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the use of lightweight crypto requirements, which could place it in cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
