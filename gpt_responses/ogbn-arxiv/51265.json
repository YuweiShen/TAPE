The use of embedding learning also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The merging post-processing method involves graph-based clustering, which could be categorized under computer graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the application of the proposed method to fiber composites suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
