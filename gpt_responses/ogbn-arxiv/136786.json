Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the configuration and diagnosis of these networks, which involves security and information theory, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also analyzes traffic patterns and mobility behaviors of users, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper proposes a heterogeneity-aware scheme, which involves computational complexity and algorithms, making cs.CY (Computers and Society) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
