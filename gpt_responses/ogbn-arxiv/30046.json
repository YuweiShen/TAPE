The proposed method involves smoothing, lifting, and thresholding, which are techniques that are often used in signal processing and machine learning (cs.MM, cs.IT, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of a convex variant of the Mumford-Shah model, which is a well-known method in image processing (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
