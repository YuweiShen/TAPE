The paper also characterizes the achievable distortion, which is a common metric in information theory.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes hardware-limited task-based quantization systems, which are designed to provide a suitable representation for a specific system task. This is a common problem in systems and control.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper applies the proposed quantization systems to the practical setups of channel estimation and eigen-spectrum recovery, which are common problems in machine learning.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with quantization, which is a critical component in multimedia systems such as image and video compression.\n5. cs.SP (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with quantization, which is a fundamental problem in signal processing.
