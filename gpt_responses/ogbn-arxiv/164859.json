This connects to computational complexity theory.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper mentions the avoidance of patterns in graphs, which is a topic in graph theory and game theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses algorithms to construct words that avoid certain patterns, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
