The paper proposes a new multi-source APE model that uses a transformer encoder block for source and a decoder block without masking for self-attention on machine translated text, which is a novel architecture for NLP and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed model on the WMT 2016, 2017, and 2018 English-German APE shared tasks, which involves machine translation and language generation (cs.NE, cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses deep learning techniques and neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
