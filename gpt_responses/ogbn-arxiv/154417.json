Specifically, the paper focuses on the use of morphological representations and distributional semantic clusters to improve the performance of sentiment analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as these fields are also relevant to the techniques used in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
