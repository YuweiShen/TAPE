This involves defining a neural network using the TensorFlow framework and training it on simulated MRF data computed using the Bloch equations. The accuracy of the network reconstruction is compared to conventional MRF template matching, and the utility of the method is demonstrated in a healthy subject in vivo. Given the focus on deep learning and neural networks, as well as the use of simulated data, computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) are the most likely sub-categories. Artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM) are also possible sub-categories given the use of deep learning methods and the focus on medical imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
