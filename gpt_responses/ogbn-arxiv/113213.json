POMDPs are a standard model for dynamic systems with probabilistic and nondeterministic behavior in uncertain environments, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also establishes computational complexity results, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of strategies and decision-making in POMDPs could also be relevant to the sub-category of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). The paper deals with dynamic systems and decision-making, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper establishes complexity results for decision problems, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Game Theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
