The use of LiDAR sweeps and voxel-based networks suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The paper also discusses modifications to improve the accuracy of 3D detectors, which may fall under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of synthetic data augmentation and temporal aggregation, which are common techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and may suggest a connection to cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
