The paper specifically focuses on privacy-preserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs), which is a machine learning technique, and hence it can also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of cryptographic techniques, which can be categorized under cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper deals with probabilistic graphical models, which can be categorized under data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of secure multi-party computation (SMPC), which can be categorized under control engineering (cs.CE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
