The paper proposes two reinforcement learning techniques, Fuzzy SARSA learning and Fuzzy Q-learning, to optimize the auto-scaling process. Both techniques involve the use of fuzzy logic systems, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the design of a self-adaptive fuzzy logic controller, which is a type of control system commonly used in systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results using the OpenStack cloud platform, which is a popular platform for cloud computing and falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
