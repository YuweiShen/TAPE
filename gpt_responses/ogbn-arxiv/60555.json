The paper also discusses the use of bump mapping, which is a technique commonly used in computer graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper uses convolutional neural networks (cs.MM) and proposes a layered approach to separate global shape from mid-level details (cs.AI). Finally, the paper provides quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed method (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
