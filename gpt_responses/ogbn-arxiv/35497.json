The concepts of bordered factors and periodicity are also related to combinatorics (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT). The investigation of the abelian critical factorization theorem suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
