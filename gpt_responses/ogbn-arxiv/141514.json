The paper also discusses the use of ReLU-nets, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper's focus on non-convex and non-smooth predictors suggests that it may also fall under the categories of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's use of PAC-Bayes analysis suggests that it may also fall under the category of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
