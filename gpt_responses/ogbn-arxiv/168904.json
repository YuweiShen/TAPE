Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also mentions implementation in Clang/LLVM, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses protecting function pointers and vtable pointers, which are related to programming languages (cs.PL). The evaluation of the system on large software packages suggests a focus on systems (cs.SY), and the use of cryptographic CPU instructions suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
