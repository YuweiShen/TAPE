The experiments are conducted on navigation and manipulation environments, which are common in robotics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for transferring learned information from a morphologically simpler agent to a more complex one, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper does not explicitly focus on computer vision, but the experiments involve visual inputs and the proposed method could potentially be applied to tasks that involve computer vision.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of policies for controlling agents and improving transfer performance, which are topics within the realm of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
