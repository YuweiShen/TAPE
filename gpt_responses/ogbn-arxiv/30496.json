It also considers the effects of propagation environment and system parameters, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper specifically focuses on cognitive radio (cs.CR), which is a subfield of communication systems that deals with the use of spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access. Finally, the paper also discusses the approximation of a power loss parameter, which is related to system modeling and analysis (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
