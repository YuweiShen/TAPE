The paper also discusses the need to retain structural information in the layout, which is a key concern in data structures (cs.DS). The algorithm presented in the paper involves minimizing additional area required, which is a common problem in computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the importance of keeping edges straight, which is relevant to the field of scientific visualization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the need to display text and graphics without overlaps, which is a common concern in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
