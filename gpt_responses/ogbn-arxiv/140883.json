The paper also mentions techniques like Dropout and Dropconnect, which are commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE). The use of deep feed-forward architectures and their capacity evaluation is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the effect of maximizing input and output margin, which is related to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
