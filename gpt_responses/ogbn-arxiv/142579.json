The paper focuses on improving the efficiency of heuristic computation, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE). Therefore, cs.AI and cs.SE are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.PL (programming languages), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), and cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
