This involves configuring a LIGO Data Grid Tier-1 Center, containerizing LIGO's workflow software using Shifter, and utilizing Open Science Grid facilities. The paper also discusses the implications of this framework for a wider ecosystem of Higher Performance Computing users. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.SC (Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.Distributed Systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
