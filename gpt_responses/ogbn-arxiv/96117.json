It may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category as it discusses the creation of high-level placement and topology descriptions that drive tools for deploying applications consisting of components running on multiple hosts. Additionally, it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it addresses issues of heterogeneity by providing abstractions over host-specific attributes yielding a homogeneous run-time environment into which components may be deployed. It may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category as it discusses the secure binding mechanisms that permit deployed components to bind to stored data and services on the hosts on which they are running. Finally, it may belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category as it addresses the issue of secure binding mechanisms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
