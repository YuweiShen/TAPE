The proposed technique is designed for complex software, which might involve multi-threading programming, ASLR, and operating system signals (cs.SE, cs.OS). The paper also mentions monitoring virtual machines in cloud environments, which falls under distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the proposed technique, which could be related to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
