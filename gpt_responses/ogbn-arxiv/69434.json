The use of deep learning models also suggests the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of multi-scale pyramid and histogram layers, which are commonly used in deep learning for image processing and feature extraction, indicating the machine learning (cs.LG) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method to image deblurring, which falls under the image processing (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
