The paper also discusses the use of linearly-weighted, multi-objective rewards, which is a topic that falls under both artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The algorithm developed in the paper can be used with continuous actions, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
