The use of heuristic methods for refining the path and accommodating changes in the operating field suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of spatiotemporal current vectors, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Finally, the use of evolutionary algorithms for optimization suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
