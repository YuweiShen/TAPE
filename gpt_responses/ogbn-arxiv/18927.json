This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the implementation of Ozone using a special hardware thread, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper evaluates Ozone using security-sensitive kernels, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
