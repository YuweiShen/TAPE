The paper also discusses the use of graded relevance assessments and measures in IR evaluation, which involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as text classification and sentiment analysis. Therefore, it could also be classified under Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Deep Learning (cs.DL).
