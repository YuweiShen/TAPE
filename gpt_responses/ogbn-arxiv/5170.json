The method involves matching the distribution of activations to a standard normal distribution using the Wasserstein distance, which is a metric commonly used in probability theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
