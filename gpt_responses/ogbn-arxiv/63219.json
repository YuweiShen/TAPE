The use of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) suggests that the paper may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) category. The focus on automatic synthesis and the mention of \"modern synthesis approaches\" suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The emphasis on correct-by-construction systems and the need to ensure cooperation between system and environment suggest that the paper may belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category. The use of formal specifications and the mention of components in a bigger system suggest that the paper may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category. Finally, the mention of guarantees and assumptions suggests that the paper may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
