The paper also proposes several novel strategies for training the actor-critic network, which involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The problem of controlling actions in a game also has connections to game theory (cs.GT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
