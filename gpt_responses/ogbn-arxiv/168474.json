Additionally, the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories as it discusses the optimization of deep neural networks. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it explores techniques for improving the computational performance and memory footprint of DNNs.
