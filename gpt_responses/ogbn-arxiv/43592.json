The stochastic policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) is also a common AI technique. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the development and evaluation of collision avoidance systems for unmanned aircraft, which falls under the domain of robotics. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a method for generating encounter trajectories for UAM systems, which involves control and optimization of the system. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses preference-based learning to tune the encounter model, which is a machine learning technique. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper involves the use of expert knowledge and preferences to generate encounter trajectories, which has implications for human-computer interaction and user-centered design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
