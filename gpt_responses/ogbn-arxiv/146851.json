This involves analyzing multivariate time series data monitored by the SCADA system. The approach involves using a CNN-LSTM architecture to learn channel-wise and temporal-wise relations. This work involves machine learning and signal processing techniques, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
