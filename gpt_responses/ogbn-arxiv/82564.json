This involves using user feedback to construct a profile for a class of entities and retrieve entities from free text. The paper is therefore likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of crowdsourced workers suggests a possible connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on user feedback and importance weighting suggests a possible connection to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
