Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the use of elastic averaging stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update scheme, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves the use of Spark for distributed data management, which can also be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
