The paper also covers various applications of spatial mode multiplexing, including free space optics, optical fiber installation, underwater wireless optical links, on-chip interconnects, data center indoor connections, radio frequency, and acoustic communications. These applications involve different aspects of computer science, such as networking (cs.NI), robotics (cs.RO), and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges and perspectives of using spatial mode multiplexing, which could fall under the category of computer vision (cs.OH) as it involves analyzing and interpreting visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
