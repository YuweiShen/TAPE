This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also involves the use of hypergeometric functions and matrix arguments, which are common in statistical inference (cs.SI) and matrix manipulation (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the spatial positions of the MIMO interferers, which could be related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
