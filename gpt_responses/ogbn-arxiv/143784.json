The method is based on the theoretical framework of belief functions and aims to capture uncertainty in the data structure. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for the use of soft decision mechanisms, Machine Learning (cs.LG) for the development of a new clustering algorithm, Databases (cs.DB) for the focus on relational data sets, Data Mining (cs.DM) for the use of clustering in data analysis, and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) for the potential application of the method in network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
