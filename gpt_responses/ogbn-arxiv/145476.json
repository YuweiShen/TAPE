The paper focuses on machine learning and computer vision applications, which are typically covered by the cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.AI sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of low-rank constraints to exploit high-order label correlations, which is relevant to the cs.CL and cs.IR sub-categories that deal with natural language processing and information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
