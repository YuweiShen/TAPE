This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a sparse-coded modulation algorithm, which involves coding theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed system also involves multiple access techniques, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses simulation results, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) for visualizing and analyzing the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
