The physical channel model used in the paper also suggests a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper highlights the influences of propagation rays and antenna array topologies, which could be relevant to physics (cs.PHYS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
