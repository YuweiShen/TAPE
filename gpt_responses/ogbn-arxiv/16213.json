The use of large antenna arrays and hybrid analog-digital pre-coding architectures also suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SP) and hardware architecture (cs.AR). However, since the paper primarily focuses on the design of a cognitive transceiver for efficient coexistence with incumbent services, we believe that cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.AR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
