Additionally, the paper experiments with different architectures on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in machine learning research. The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image datasets and neural network architectures commonly used in computer vision tasks. The paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with improving the performance of neural networks, which are commonly used in AI applications. The paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it deals with the quantization of weights and activations in neural networks. Finally, the paper may belong to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category as it involves the storage and manipulation of weights and activations in neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
