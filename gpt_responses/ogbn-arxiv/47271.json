This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for graph extraction and packing, as well as for parallel execution of user programs. \n2. cs.DB (Databases): Large-scale graphs are often stored in databases, and there is a growing interest in executing complex analytics over them. The paper addresses this problem by introducing a new framework for subgraph-centric analytics in the cloud. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on distributed execution of subgraph-centric analytics over large-scale graphs in the cloud. This involves designing efficient algorithms for partitioning and packing subgraphs, as well as for parallel execution of user programs. \n4. cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing): The paper introduces a new framework for distributed execution of subgraph-centric analytics over large-scale graphs in the cloud. This involves designing efficient algorithms for partitioning and packing subgraphs, as well as for parallel execution of user programs. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses several applications of subgraph-centric analytics, such as ego network analysis, motif counting, and personalized recommendations. These are all areas of active research in AI, and the paper proposes a new framework for executing these tasks"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
