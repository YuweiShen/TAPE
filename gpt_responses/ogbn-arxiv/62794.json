It also involves the use of neural networks, which could place it in the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The recursive architecture used in BridgeNet could also suggest a potential fit for the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of intermediate feature representations from a teacher network could place it in the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
