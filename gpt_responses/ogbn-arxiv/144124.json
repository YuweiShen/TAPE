This involves the use of deep learning models and ensembling approaches, which are commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with clinical decision support systems, which falls under the bioinformatics (cs.BIO) sub-category. The use of deep learning models also involves the study of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
