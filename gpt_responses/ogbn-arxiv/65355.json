This involves collecting data on causes of requirements engineering problems from 74 Brazilian organizations and building a Bayesian network to support DCA sessions. The paper also evaluates the approach through a model for technology transfer to industry and conducts three consecutive evaluations. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is software engineering (cs.SE) as the paper focuses on improving software processes through DCA. Other likely sub-categories include cybernetics (cs.CY) as the Bayesian network approach involves modeling cause-effect relations, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as the approach uses diagnostic inference, machine learning (cs.LG) as the Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model, and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as the approach involves evaluating the effectiveness of the DCA approach in practice."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
