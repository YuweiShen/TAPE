The study of complexity of problems related to irredundant equivalent subsets suggests that it may also fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of redundancy with different definitions of equivalence may also relate to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
