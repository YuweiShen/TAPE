The paper also involves optimization problems and algorithms, which are relevant to information theory (cs.IT). The simulations and evaluations of the proposed scheme involve multimedia applications and performance metrics, which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a distributed scheme for interference management, which could be considered a system-level approach (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves the decomposition of a complex problem into smaller sub-problems, which could be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
