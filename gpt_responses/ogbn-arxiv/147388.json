The use of deep residual and convolutional networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of multimedia data, specifically facial images, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The task of affective computing also involves human-computer interaction, which could place it in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks for affective computing could also place it in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
