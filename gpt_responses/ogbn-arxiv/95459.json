It also discusses their performance tests in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). Additionally, the paper involves numerical analysis (cs.NA), mathematical software (cs.MS), and computational engineering (cs.CE) due to its focus on optimizing the performance of the SHTs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
