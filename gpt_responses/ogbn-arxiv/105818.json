The paper also involves the use of lattice reduction and sampling techniques, which are common in the Discrete Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of successive interference cancelation (SIC) and optimization of decoding performance suggest the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category as another likely option. The paper also involves numerical optimization and simulation, which are common in the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes an efficient implementation of random rounding, which is a topic typically covered in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
