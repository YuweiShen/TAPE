The use of millimeter-wave bands and channel state information also suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT). The proposed framework also involves swarm intelligence, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the reliability and latency tradeoffs, which are important considerations in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of millimeter-wave bands for vehicular communications involves the use of high-frequency electromagnetic waves, which is a topic that falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
