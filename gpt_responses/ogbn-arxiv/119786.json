Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SD (Sound), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the paper also involves voice activity detection and automatic speech recognition. The paper also discusses the use of DNNs, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the estimation of relative transfer functions, which falls under cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
