The algorithm is adaptive to the estimated channel condition and is causal, adjusting retransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. The paper also proposes an adaptive packet allocation algorithm for retransmission and a decentralized balancing optimization algorithm to minimize throughput degradation caused by variations in channel quality. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), networking (cs.NI), control systems (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
