The paper also discusses the use of these subdivisions in meshing methods, which relates to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents visualizations of the tetrahedral meshes, which could be relevant to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
