The paper also focuses on scene arrangement and object generation, which are topics in computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of neural networks and data-driven scene priors suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of the proposed method to interior design and virtual reality suggests a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
