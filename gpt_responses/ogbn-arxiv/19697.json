This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses supervised learning to train the distributed neural flocking controller. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with flocking controllers for robots, which involves coordination and control of multiple agents. This falls under the scope of robotics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses deep learning to synthesize the distributed flocking controller, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not directly related to computer vision, the paper deals with achieving flocking formation, collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, predator avoidance, and target seeking, which can be considered as pattern recognition tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
