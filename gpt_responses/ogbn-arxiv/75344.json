The paper focuses on dynamic algorithms, which suggests that it belongs to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also deals with approximation algorithms, which suggests that it belongs to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category. The paper involves combinatorial algorithms, which suggests that it belongs to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category.
