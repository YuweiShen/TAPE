The paper also introduces a new policy gradient and baseline, which are common topics in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is designed to efficiently train all levels of the hierarchy simultaneously, which is a common problem in Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of time-abstractions, which is a technique commonly used in Computer Vision (cs.CV) for video analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
