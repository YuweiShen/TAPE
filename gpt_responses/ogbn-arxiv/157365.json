The techniques used involve LSH and k-d trees, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) for approximate nearest-neighbor search. Finally, the paper also discusses the integration of these techniques into the Anserini open-source toolkit, which is related to information retrieval and search engines (cs.IR) as well as data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
