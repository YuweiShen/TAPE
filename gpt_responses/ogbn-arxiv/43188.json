This suggests that the paper could belong to the Sound sub-category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses a natural language processing technique (word2vec) to learn vector representations of folksong motifs. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computation and Language sub-category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper presents a new evaluation method for testing the quality of the embeddings based on a melodic similarity task. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a machine learning technique (skip-gram version of word2vec with negative sampling) to learn vector representations of folksong motifs. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a technique (word2vec) that is commonly used in artificial intelligence research to learn vector representations of folksong motifs. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
