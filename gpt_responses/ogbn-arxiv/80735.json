This is because the paper proposes a framework for answering open domain multi-hop questions using neural question generation networks, which are commonly used in natural language processing and machine learning research (cs.CL). The paper also involves the use of pretrained single-hop answer extractors, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence research (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of generating followup questions that select relevant answer spans and avoid distracting premises, which are common issues in machine learning and natural language processing research (cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
