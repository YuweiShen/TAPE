The paper also proposes a construction method for creating redundancy versions of polar codes, which involves a greedy algorithm and symmetry in polar code construction, indicating a connection to coding theory (cs.CC). The simulations conducted in the paper are for binary input AWGN channel, which is a topic related to signal processing and communication (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the joint decoding of polar codes, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of polar codes, which is a topic related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
