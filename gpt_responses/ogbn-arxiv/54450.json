The paper also discusses the connectivity and diameter of graphs, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DS). The use of OAT graphs, a new class of graphs, suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the algorithms presented in the paper suggest that it may also belong to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
