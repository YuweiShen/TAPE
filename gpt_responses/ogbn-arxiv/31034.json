Therefore, cs.DB and cs.IR are likely categories. The problem is also related to data streaming, which suggests cs.DS as another possible category. The paper proposes an algorithm that provides accurate estimates with sublinear space, which involves statistical techniques and machine learning, indicating cs.LG as a potential category. Finally, the problem of similarity join and self-join size estimation is also relevant to computational complexity and algorithm design, which could make cs.CR a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
