The dataset includes video recordings of both eyes and egocentric camera, joystick commands, and electromyography, which could be of interest to researchers studying human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the potential use of the dataset for intention prediction and human mental state modeling, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
