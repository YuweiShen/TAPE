Specifically, the paper discusses methods for improving the inference accuracy and optimizing core occupation and performance on the chip. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
