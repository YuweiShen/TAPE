The use of Monte Carlo test-time model averaging and deep vector averaging suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of residual connections is a common technique in neural networks, which suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also mentions text classification datasets, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for processing text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
