The paper uses deep learning techniques to simulate the human grading process and assign a patient-based AMD severity score using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) Simplified Severity Scale. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Computer Vision (cs.CV), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
