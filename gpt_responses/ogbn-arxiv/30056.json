It is also likely to belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category as eye tracking is an important tool in this field. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the processing of large-scale datasets, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of calibration techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
