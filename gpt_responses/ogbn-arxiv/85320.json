Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the sensitivity analysis and ablation study, which are common techniques used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the perceptual mechanisms of the Gestalt theory, which is related to neuroscience and cognitive science (cs.NE) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
