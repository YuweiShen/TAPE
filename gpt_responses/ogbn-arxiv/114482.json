The paper specifically focuses on the performance trade-offs of two hardware-assisted memory protection mechanisms, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also evaluates the impact of these mechanisms on latency, throughput, processing time, and energy requirements, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
