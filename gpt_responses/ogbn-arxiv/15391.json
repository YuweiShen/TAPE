The paper also focuses on parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing, which falls under the category of parallel computing (cs.DC) and performance analysis (cs.PF). Finally, the paper describes the implementation of these algorithms in programming languages, which is relevant to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
