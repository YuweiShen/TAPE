Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes new intractable assumptions based on exponential mapping, which can be related to cs.SD (Systems and Control) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents a public key encryption scheme, which can be related to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
