The paper proposes a framework and training algorithm for enhancing the robustness of neural networks, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses principles for enhancing robustness, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper applies the proposed framework to a specific challenge, which involves neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
