The use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Information Set MCTS (IS-MCTS) also suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of stochastic optimization and learning (cs.SI). Finally, the creation of rule-based agents falls under the sub-category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
