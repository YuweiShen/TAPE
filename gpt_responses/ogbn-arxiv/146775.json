The paper also discusses the bias in CNNs and attempts to increase the shape bias in the learned representation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of domain-adversarial training is also a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with image datasets and their classification, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
