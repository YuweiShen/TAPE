The approach uses an optimization model to find the 3D caricature that captures the style of the 2D caricature image automatically, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.MM) techniques. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing approaches that use classical parametric face models, which suggests that the proposed approach may involve some form of machine learning or deep learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
