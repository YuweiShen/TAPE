This suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Speech and Audio Processing (cs.SD) and Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, which may also suggest sub-categories such as Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Sound and Music Computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method in noisy environments, which may suggest the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
