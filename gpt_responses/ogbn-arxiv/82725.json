The experiments are conducted on image classification datasets, indicating a focus on computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper introduces a generic mechanism that can be adapted for any type of architecture, which suggests a broader scope and could potentially fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
