Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also touches upon the communication between stakeholders, which could fall under cs.CY (Computational Social Science) or cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The focus on safety compliance documents and architecture models could also relate to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the mention of a systems engineering tool could suggest cs.CE (Computational Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
