The paper specifically focuses on the issue of communication uncertainties, which suggests that it may fall under the categories of multi-agent systems (cs.MA), robotics (cs.RO), and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a distributed controller, which involves the use of Lyapunov-like barrier functions, indicating that it may be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
