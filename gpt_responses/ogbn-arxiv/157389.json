Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel approach to address this problem, which involves approximating arbitrary filters using Gaussian-Hermite basis. This approach falls under the category of machine learning (ML) techniques, which is covered by cs.LG and cs.AI. Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of training and test, which is related to the optimization of neural networks, covered by cs.NE. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of sub-sampling, which is a common technique in multimedia (MM) processing. Therefore, cs.MM is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
