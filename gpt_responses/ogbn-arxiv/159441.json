The focus of the paper is on learning interpretable classification rules, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of propositional logic, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL). The experiments conducted in the paper involve solving large-scale instances of classification problems, which is a topic in computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of constraint satisfaction techniques, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
