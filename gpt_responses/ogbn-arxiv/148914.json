This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of medical imaging data. Deep learning (cs.DL) may also be relevant given the potential for neural networks to be used in radiomics analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
