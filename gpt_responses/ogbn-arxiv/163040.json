The paper derives closed-form expressions for message decoding probabilities, throughput, and outage probability, which are typical metrics studied in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies the performance of hybrid RF-FSO links, which are relevant to wireless communication networks. The paper evaluates the effect of adaptive power allocation and different channel conditions on the throughput and the outage probability, which are important aspects of network performance. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper analyzes the performance of hybrid RF-FSO links, which are a type of communication link. The paper considers the cases with and without hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), which is a common technique used in communication systems. \n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper may also be relevant to other sub-categories of computer science, such as optics or signal processing. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper may be relevant to the design and control of hybrid RF-FSO systems, which involve both wireless and optical components."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
