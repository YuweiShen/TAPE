It also addresses the challenge of zero-shot learning, which involves transferring knowledge from one domain to another, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach proposed in the paper involves leveraging semantic information to improve feature embedding, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
