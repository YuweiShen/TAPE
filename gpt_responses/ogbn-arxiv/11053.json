This topic falls under the area of information theory (cs.IT) as well as networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) since it involves designing efficient communication systems. The paper also discusses the use of cooperative base stations, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas and multiple users also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COMM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
