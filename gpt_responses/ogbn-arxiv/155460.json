The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to estimate and fine-tune the decision boundary between seen and novel/unseen classes. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
