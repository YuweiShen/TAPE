The focus is on multimodal retrieval, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. The paper also introduces a new model selection method and a new sentence embedding technique, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.CL, followed by cs.IR, cs.LG, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
