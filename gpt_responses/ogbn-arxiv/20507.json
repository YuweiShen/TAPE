This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The use of dynamic time warping for scoring also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component. Additionally, the paper involves text recognition (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with egocentric camera streams."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
