The paper proposes a new technique for visualizing the internal workings of these models, which involves combining two recent techniques (SMOOTHGRAD and Grad-CAM++) and applying them at the inference level (model prediction process). This technique is aimed at creating more visually sharp maps with better object localization, which is a key problem in computer vision and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing techniques and how the proposed technique overcomes them, which is a common theme in explainable AI research (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed technique on a few images and compares it with other methods, which involves experimental evaluation and performance analysis, a common theme in natural language processing and computer vision research (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
