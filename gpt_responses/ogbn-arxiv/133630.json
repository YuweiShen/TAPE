The use of optimization techniques and geometric objects to compute upper bounds on collision risk suggests that the paper belongs to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of provable guarantees on safety also suggests that the paper may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of optimization techniques and the mention of iterative linearization suggest that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the mention of complex environments suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
