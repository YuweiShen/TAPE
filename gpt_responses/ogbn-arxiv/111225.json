The use of channel estimates and multivariate Gaussian vectors suggests a connection to signal processing and machine learning (cs.MM), while the iterative algorithm proposed for solving the optimization problem is a typical tool in optimization and control theory (cs.SI). Finally, the fact that the paper deals with wireless communication and channel fading makes it relevant to the networking and internet architecture community (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
