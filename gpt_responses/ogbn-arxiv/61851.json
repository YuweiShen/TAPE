The paper also discusses the choice of action space in RL, which is a topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments in the paper involve controlling a robot's end-effector, which is a topic in Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of RL policies on different tasks, which involves Computer Vision (cs.CV) to some extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
