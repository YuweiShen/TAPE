Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The proposed method involves enforcing local regions of hidden states to generate target tokens with the same semantic structure tag, which could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with information extraction, which could be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
