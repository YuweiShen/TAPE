This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for handling large amounts of data, which falls under the scope of cs.DS.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The problem of continuous object dissemination involves analyzing users' preferences and delivering objects to all users who prefer them. This is a common problem in social networks and information networks, which makes cs.SI a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an approximate solution for finding target users that is more efficient than the exact one while ensuring sufficient accuracy. This involves using machine learning techniques to optimize the algorithm, which falls under the scope of cs.LG.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The problem of finding target users of a new object involves retrieving relevant information about users' preferences and clustering them based on similarity. This falls under the scope of cs.IR, which deals with techniques for retrieving and organizing information.\n5. cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes an append-only table of objects with multiple attributes and users' preferences on individual attributes are modeled as strict partial orders.
