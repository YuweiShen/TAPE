The authors analyze the problem of selecting polling places from a strategic perspective, and consider the incentives of different actors in the election process. \n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a computational study of the problem of selecting polling places, and analyzes its complexity and approximability. The authors propose algorithms for solving the problem in restricted cases, and discuss the performance of existing algorithms for standard control actions in the geographic setting. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the manipulation of elections through the selection of polling places, which is a form of social influence. The authors analyze the impact of different control actions on the outcome of the election, and consider the role of social networks in the diffusion of information about the election. \n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with the social and ethical implications of manipulating elections through the selection of polling places. The authors discuss the potential consequences of such manipulation for the legitimacy of the electoral process, and consider the role of technology in mitigating or exacerbating these consequences. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the problem of selecting polling places from a computational perspective, and proposes algorithms for solving the problem"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
