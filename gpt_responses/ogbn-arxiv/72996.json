The use of a massive MIMO base station also involves system-level considerations, making the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category a possibility. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a rank-reduced channel model, which is a technique used in signal processing and communications (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper's focus on composite channel estimation could also place it under the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
