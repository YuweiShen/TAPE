The paper also uses mathematical tools to develop upper and lower bounds, which suggests a focus on theoretical aspects of the problem, making categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.ST) possible. The paper also compares its results with existing results in the literature, which suggests a focus on multiple measurement vectors (MMV) and related topics, making cs.MM a likely category. Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of joint sparsity structure in noisy JSM-2, which suggests a focus on applications and practical aspects of the problem, making categories such as social and information networks (cs.SI) possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
