The paper also uses attention mechanisms and classifiers, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the CRAC dataset, which is related to named entity recognition (cs.NE) and coreference resolution (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of classifiers for identifying non-referring expressions, which could potentially involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for identifying visual cues in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
