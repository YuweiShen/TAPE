The use of a robust Huber loss and a regularization scheme also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The optimization algorithm used in the paper, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, suggests that it could also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the empirical validation of the algorithm on synthetic and real images suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
