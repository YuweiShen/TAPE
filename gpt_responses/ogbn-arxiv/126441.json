The use of linear temporal logics and symbolic bounded model checking suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on evolutionary biology and the use of a weighted GRN model suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of bioinformatics (cs.BIO) and emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
