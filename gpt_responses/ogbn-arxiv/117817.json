The use of discrete input signal constellations and the analysis of the outage probability suggest a focus on Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the mention of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) indicates a possible connection to Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
