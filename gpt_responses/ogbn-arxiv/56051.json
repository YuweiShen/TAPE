The optimization scheme presented in the paper is also relevant to researchers in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper may be of interest to researchers in information retrieval and similarity search (cs.SI), as it proposes a new measure of similarity that may be useful in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
