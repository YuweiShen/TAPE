This involves incorporating leg odometry and addressing leg odometry drift caused by unmodeled uncertainties at the contact point. The paper also uses stereo vision and IMU factors for accurate estimation. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
