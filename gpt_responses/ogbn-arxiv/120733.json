Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of information processing, including signal processing and compressive sensing. The paper also involves statistical inference and estimation, which are relevant to cs.SI (Statistical Learning), and cs.SP (Signal Processing). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning).
