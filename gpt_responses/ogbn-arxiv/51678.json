The proposed torque control techniques and stability conditions are relevant to robotics research.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses advanced torque control techniques and stability conditions for series-elastic actuators. This falls under the scope of systems and control research.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper deals with the safe rendering of high impedance on a series-elastic actuator, which is a mechanical engineering problem. The proposed compensator is also a mechanical system.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves the use of computational techniques to design and validate the proposed torque control and stability conditions.\n- cs.EM (Engineering Mathematics): The paper uses mathematical models and stability analysis to derive the proposed passivity-based conditions for safe impedance range."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
