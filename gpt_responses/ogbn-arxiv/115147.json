It may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as it proposes a distributed GPU hierarchical parameter server for training massive scale deep learning models. Additionally, it may be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it deals with encoding and storing large amounts of sparse features. It may also be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it mentions the use of query-ad relevance as one of the inputs to the neural network. Finally, it may be relevant to cs.DB (Databases) as it discusses the use of SSD as a storage layer in the proposed hierarchical workflow."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
