This technique is a tradeoff between phased-array and MIMO radars, and the paper demonstrates its effectiveness through analytical and simulation results. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. Other likely sub-categories include cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.RF (Radio Frequency and Microwave Technology), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which are all relevant to the proposed technique and its applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
