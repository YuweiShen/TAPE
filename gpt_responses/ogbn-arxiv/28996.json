The paper focuses on the dynamic selection of the most competent base detectors, with an emphasis on data locality. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), computer vision (cs.CV), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as outlier detection is often used in security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
