The focus is on the small cell network and the enabling technology of 3D hybrid beamforming. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses link-level and system-level performances, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the use of a 3D ray-tracing tool for system-level simulations could place it in cs.AR (Augmented Reality) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
