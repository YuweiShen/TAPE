The paper also draws inspiration from the theory of group representation in physics, which suggests a connection to the field of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The experimental results involve learning representations of explicitly symmetric environments, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper focuses on the accuracy of long-horizon predictions, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
