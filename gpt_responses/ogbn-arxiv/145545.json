The use of domain randomisation for training agents in simulation is a popular method in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the trained agents' generalisation abilities involves visuomotor control tasks, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the examination of the agents' weights and activations is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
