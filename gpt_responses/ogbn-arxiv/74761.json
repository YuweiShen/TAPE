This topic falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as well as distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), numerical analysis (cs.NA), systems and control (cs.SY), and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The paper discusses the theoretical convergence properties and simulation examples of the proposed method, which are common themes in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
