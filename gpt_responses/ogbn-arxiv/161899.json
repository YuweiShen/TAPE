This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses feedback reduction techniques in LiFi networks, which involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and throughput. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - LiFi is a subset of optical wireless communications and involves the use of visible light and infrared for communication. This falls under the scope of multimedia as it involves the transmission of audio and visual data.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not explicitly discuss security, but LiFi networks may have security concerns that need to be addressed. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not discuss social or ethical implications of LiFi networks, but it may be relevant to the field of computers and society in the future."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
