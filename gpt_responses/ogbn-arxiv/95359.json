The use of Twitter as a case study suggests a focus on social media platforms, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.SOC (Social and Societal Computing). The attention economy solution and algorithm used to select informative tweets suggest a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.SD).
