The proposed system can be installed on robotic platforms such as USVs and UAVs, indicating that it also falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of deep learning for algae detection implies that it could also be classified under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper involves image processing and pattern recognition, which are relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning for real-time detection suggests that it could also be classified under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
