The threat of face morphing attacks and the proposed solution also involve aspects of cybersecurity (cs.CR). The use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) is a popular technique in image processing and computer vision, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed method involves deep learning and neural networks, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
