Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the use of optimization techniques to solve the problem, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with the use of Massive MIMO, which is a topic related to signal processing and communication systems, and could therefore be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a reformulation of the problem to make it computationally tractable, which involves the use of optimization algorithms and techniques, and could therefore also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
