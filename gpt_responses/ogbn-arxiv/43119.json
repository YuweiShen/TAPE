The use of low resolution DACs is a hardware implementation issue, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses spectral shaping and cross-correlation properties, which are related to signal processing (cs.SP). The use of the GAMP algorithm for solving the beampattern and spectral shaping problem is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with radar systems, which are related to sensor networks and embedded systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
