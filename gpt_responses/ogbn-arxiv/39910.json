This requires managing large datasets in the order of Terabytes and executing computations that can take days or weeks. The paper presents an algorithm that addresses both issues by streaming data from hard disk to main memory to GPUs and achieving sustained peak performance. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with parallelizing computations across multiple GPUs to achieve better performance, which is a key aspect of distributed and parallel computing. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with managing large datasets in the order of Terabytes, which is a key aspect of database systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with solving generalized least-squares problems, which is a common optimization problem in machine learning. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper deals with numerical optimization techniques for solving least-squares problems, which is a key aspect of numerical analysis. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents an algorithm for optimizing the performance of GWAS computations, which is a key aspect of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
