The study also focuses on understanding the principles behind the classification of images, which is a core aspect of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a new approach called Deepception that exploits the properties of deep neural networks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study also involves testing the properties on different networks, which suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image recognition, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
