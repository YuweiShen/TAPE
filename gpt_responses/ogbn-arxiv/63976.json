The paper proposes an algorithm for this problem and provides performance guarantees, which are typical of papers in the cs.IT and cs.LG sub-categories. The paper also includes numerical experiments on image data, which is relevant to the cs.CV sub-category. The use of alternating minimization is a common technique in the cs.NA sub-category, and the problem of compressed sensing is a fundamental topic in the cs.SI sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
