Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions type systems and algorithms, which are topics in programming languages and computer science theory, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) likely sub-categories as well. The paper's focus on proof-structures and type-checking also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of algorithms and complexity analysis suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
