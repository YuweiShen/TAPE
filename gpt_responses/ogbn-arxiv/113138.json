Specifically, it uses time-lapsed videos obtained from upward facing wide-lensed cameras to directly estimate and forecast solar irradiance. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category, as it deals with image and video analysis. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also deals with forecasting, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category. Finally, the paper uses neural networks to make predictions, which suggests that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
