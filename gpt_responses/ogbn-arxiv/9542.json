The method involves handling complex spatial arrangements such as occlusions, which requires computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also introduces a novel planning criterion and action space formulation, which involves machine learning and optimization (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper aims to enable robots to learn wide repertoires of complex skills, which involves control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
