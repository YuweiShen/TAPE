The paper also mentions neural networks, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper applies the framework to regularizers used in computer vision (cs.CV) and neuroscience (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of regularization in variational inference, which is a statistical method often used in the subfield of statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
