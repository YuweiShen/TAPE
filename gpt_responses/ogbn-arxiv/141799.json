This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also discusses the achievability of the bounds, which relates to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of inequalities to capture some of the joint CSIT states involves mathematical optimization techniques, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also considers a two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) BC, which relates to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the results for practical communication systems, which falls under the computer engineering (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
