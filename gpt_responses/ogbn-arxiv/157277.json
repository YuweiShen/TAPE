This falls under the realm of information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also makes use of algebraic structures and Riemann-Roch spaces, which are topics in algebraic geometry (cs.AG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of certain algorithms for polynomial multiplication, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
