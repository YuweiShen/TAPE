The proposed method involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hierarchical response maps, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of UAV tracking, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with multi-resolution images, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
