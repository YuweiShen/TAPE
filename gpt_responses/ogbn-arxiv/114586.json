Additionally, the paper mentions visual environment perception, which is a key area of computer vision (cs.CV). The use of open source datasets and industry leaders also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the challenges of autonomous driving, such as safety and regulation, fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
