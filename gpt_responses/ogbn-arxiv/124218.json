The focus on illumination invariance and the use of specialized loss functions also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the use of the BigTime dataset and analysis of patch matching and rigid registration suggest a neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
