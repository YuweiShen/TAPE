The paper also discusses the use of para-unitary matrices, which are commonly used in signal processing and communications, making cs.SI a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper involves the study of recursive constructions and generalized seed PU matrices, which are topics related to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper proposes new constructions of CSSs and CCCs, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
