This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of dilated convolution and residual connections, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions uncertainty estimation, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
