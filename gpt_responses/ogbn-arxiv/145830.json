Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the use of per-cell beamforming, which is a technique used in networked communication systems, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely category. The paper also presents a novel approach that uses second-order statistical information, which falls under the category of cs.SI (Signal Processing). The paper also discusses the use of massive MIMO, which is a technique used in wireless communication systems, making cs.MM (Mobile Computing) another likely category. Finally, the paper presents analytical results and simulations, which fall under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
