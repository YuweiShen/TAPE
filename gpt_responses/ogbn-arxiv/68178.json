This approach is implemented using deep learning architectures and enables navigation at a higher level of semantic abstraction. Given the focus on robotics and deep learning, cs.RO is the most likely sub-category. The use of visual inputs and deep learning architectures also suggests that cs.CV and cs.AI are likely sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simulating navigation tasks, which suggests that cs.LG is a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of a graph representation and the focus on control and switching of behaviors suggests that cs.SY is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
