The paper proposes a system theoretic methodology to account for queueing behavior and spatial correlations in finite time and space regimes. This methodology involves the use of probability distributions to derive closed-form capacity results. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
