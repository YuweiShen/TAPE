Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of memory and reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of lightweight feature extractors and the focus on mobile methods suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
