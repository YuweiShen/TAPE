This involves extracting convolutional features for each frame and using temporal stacking to generate scores and regressions. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques such as the SSD framework suggests that the paper could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on video analysis and the use of bounding boxes and cuboids suggests that the paper could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of temporal continuity and the generation of tubelets suggests that the paper could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
