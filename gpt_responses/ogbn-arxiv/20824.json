This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also mentions designing indexes for other types of queries, which could fall under data structures (cs.DS) or data mining (cs.DM). The use of entropy in one of the variants suggests information theory (cs.IT) as a possible category. Finally, the mention of implicit data structures suggests the possibility of work on succinct data structures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
