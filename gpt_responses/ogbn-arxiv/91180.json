Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of state-of-the-art detectors such as Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, Mask R-CNN, and SSD, which are commonly used in deep learning and neural network research, suggesting a possible fit with cs.DL (Machine Learning). The paper also examines the impact of image compression and data scarcity, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between detection accuracy, detection speed, and file size, which could be relevant to sub-category cs.LG (Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
