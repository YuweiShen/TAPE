The problem of maximizing the rate of the secondary user while keeping the interference power to the primary user below a threshold can be seen as a control and optimization problem, falling under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of multiple transmit antennas and a single receive antenna suggests that the paper may also involve signal processing and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the development of an analytical solution from a geometric perspective suggests that the paper may also involve geometry and topology (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
