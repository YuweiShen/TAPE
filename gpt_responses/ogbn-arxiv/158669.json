The Interval Algebra is commonly used in temporal databases (cs.DB) and scheduling/planning applications, which also makes these categories likely. The paper also includes a preliminary experimental evaluation, which suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and computer engineering (cs.CE) may also be relevant categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
