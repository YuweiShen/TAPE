This is a common problem in computer vision, which is typically addressed in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which is a common theme in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
