It also mentions the ResNet and AlexNet models, which are commonly used in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a method for reducing the precision of weights in neural networks while maintaining accuracy. \n\nArtificial intelligence (cs.AI) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with deep neural networks, which are a popular tool in AI research. \n\nNeural networks (cs.NE) is also a possible sub-category as the paper deals with reducing the precision of weights in neural networks. \n\nFinally, augmented reality (cs.AR) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not explicitly mention AR, but it is possible that the proposed method could be applied to AR applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
