Information theory concepts such as sampling and compressive sensing are used in the proposed approach. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a tensor algebraic method for adaptive sampling of RF fingerprints, which involves numerical computations and optimization. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of reference points that are highly informative for learning the low-dimensional tensor-column space, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques. \n- cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of indoor localization, which is a control problem in the context of pervasive wireless applications. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): Similar to cs.SI, the paper deals with a control problem in the context of wireless systems, and proposes a method for optimizing the sampling of RF fingerprints."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
