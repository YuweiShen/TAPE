The focus on fairness and bias detection suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cybersecurity (cs.CR), as biased algorithms can have security implications. Additionally, the use of observational data and causal inference may be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's emphasis on practical guidelines for practitioners suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of computer and society (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
