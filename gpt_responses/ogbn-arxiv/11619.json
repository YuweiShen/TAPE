This falls under the broad category of machine learning, which is covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. Specifically, the paper focuses on deep clustering models and self-organizing maps, which are commonly used in the areas of deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
