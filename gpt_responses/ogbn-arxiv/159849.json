The paper proposes a new algorithm for this problem, which uses Thompson Sampling and Bayesian change point detection. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, control systems, and information theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
