The paper proposes two tractable estimators for this problem and analyzes their theoretical guarantees. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also uses information theory to derive bounds, which suggests a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
