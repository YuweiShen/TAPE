Specifically, it focuses on the K-means algorithm and proposes a related model called K-indicators. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions spectral clustering, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and discusses the scalability bottleneck, which is related to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
