This involves building graphs over the scene objects and over the question words, and using a deep neural network that exploits the structure in these representations. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves joint reasoning over the visual and text domains, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
