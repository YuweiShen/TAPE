The paper proposes a weakly-supervised learning approach, which involves designing loss functions and training models, indicating that it could also belong to cs.LG and cs.AI. The paper also mentions the use of evaluation metrics, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM. Finally, the paper deals with image processing and analysis, which could also make it relevant to cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
