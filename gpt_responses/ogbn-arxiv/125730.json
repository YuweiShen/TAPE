The paper also discusses the use of separable structures for these operators, which is a common technique in signal processing and image analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of these operators for structural analysis of signals, which is related to the sub-category cs.SI (Signal Processing) and the use of these operators for efficient computation, which is related to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
