The paper also discusses the use of edge computing to improve DNN inference, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper mentions computer vision (cs.CV) as a potential application for DNNs, and discusses the impact of network fluctuations on the performance of the proposed framework, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
