This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), as it involves maximizing the average mutual information of the channel. It also involves optimization (cs.OH), as the precoder design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. The use of MIMO channels and statistical CSI suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.MM, cs.SI, cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
