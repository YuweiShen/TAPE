The use of Gabidulin codes is a novel approach to this problem, which is related to coding theory and information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also discusses the field extensions that can be used in the code construction, which is related to algebraic geometry and number theory. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper presents numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is related to numerical analysis and scientific computing. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
