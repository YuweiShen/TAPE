Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves the use of deep learning and reinforcement learning, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.RO (Robotics) likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with control systems, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category.
