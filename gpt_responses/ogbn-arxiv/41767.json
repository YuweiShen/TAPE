This involves managing conflicts and interference between the robots. The paper uses techniques such as shared idleness representation, coordination mechanisms, and multi-robot traversability function. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of robotics (cs.RO), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
