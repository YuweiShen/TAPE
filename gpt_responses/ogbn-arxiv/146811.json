This involves collecting variable-width route lines side by side while minimizing crossings, encoding them with categorical colors, and decorating them with glyphs to show their directions. The technique is evaluated through a crowd-sourced user study investigating route tracing performance with road networks visualized using the route packing technique. Given the focus on geospatial visualization and human-computer interaction, as well as the use of glyphs and colors for encoding information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.GR (Graphics), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing the user study data may also suggest a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
