Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a lightweight method for detecting opinion spam, which involves statistical analysis of rating data, making it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SI (social and information networks) and cs.CR (security and privacy). Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to identify anomalous rating deviations, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
