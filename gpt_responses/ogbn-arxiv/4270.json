The use of spatial oversampling and antenna arrays is also related to networking and communication (cs.NI). The paper proposes a method to decrease the loss incurred due to quantization, which is a control and systems engineering problem (cs.SY). The use of antenna arrays and spatial oversampling also involves signal processing and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents mutual information results, which is a topic related to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
