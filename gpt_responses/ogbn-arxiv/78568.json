The proposed method involves developing a new global feature based on geodesic distances of surface mesh points, which is a common technique used in computer vision. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of physical rehabilitation equipment and the movements of attending clinicians, which suggests a potential application in robotics for assisting with patient rehabilitation. \n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the challenges of tracking human patients during physical rehabilitation, which is a common problem in human-computer interaction research. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves processing RGB-D camera data, which is a common multimedia data type. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves surface mesh points, which is a common graphics data type."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
