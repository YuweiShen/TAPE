The use of pipelines and components is also a common approach in software engineering. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions augmentation and batching, which are common techniques in neural networks, suggesting cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another likely sub-category. Finally, the use of a software framework suggests cs.DL (Deep Learning) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
