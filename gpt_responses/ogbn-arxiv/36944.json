The approach proposed involves mutation-based testing, which is a common technique used in software engineering (cs.SE). The path planner uses a weighted cost function to make decisions, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of scenarios to test the path planner, which can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
