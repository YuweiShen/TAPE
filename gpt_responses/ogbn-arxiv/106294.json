It also involves software engineering (cs.SE) in terms of implementing a transparency system for a package manager and verifying the binding between source and binary code. The paper also discusses reproducible builds, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and system design (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a novel defense against attacks on transparency systems, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
