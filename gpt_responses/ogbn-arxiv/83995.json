It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it generates sentences to describe the images. The use of deep neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the incorporation of an existing visual concept detector and the projection of image and caption into a common latent space suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the crawling of a large-scale image description corpus suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
