The use of low-density parity check codes and turbo codes also involves graph theory, which is a topic in network theory (cs.NT). The paper also discusses the practical applications of these coding techniques in wireless mobile transmission, satellite TV, and deep space communication, which fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SI). The use of spatially coupled codes also involves the study of phase transitions and threshold phenomena, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation complexity constraints of these coding techniques, which is a topic in computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
