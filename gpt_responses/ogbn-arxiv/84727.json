The paper also involves the analysis of the number of faces of the Minkowski sum, which is a fundamental problem in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.DM). The use of the Cayley trick, which is a well-known technique in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to researchers in those areas, as well as in graph theory (cs.GT) and topological data analysis (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
