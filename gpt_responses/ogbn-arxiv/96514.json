The paper also introduces a novel human evaluation protocol to assess the extent to which a summary remains true to its original meanings. Given these contributions, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as likely options. Additionally, the paper involves the evaluation of summarization datasets, which could place it in the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
