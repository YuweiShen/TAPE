This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with authentication. Additionally, the paper also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it studies the way users interact with touchscreens. The use of touch input as a behavioral biometric also has applications in cyberpsychology (cs.CY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it proposes a set of touch features that can be extracted from raw touchscreen logs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
