The paper specifically focuses on optimization challenges in multi-task learning and proposes a new approach to address these challenges. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since these sub-categories are closely related to multi-task learning. Additionally, the paper also discusses multi-task RL (Reinforcement Learning), which falls under the sub-categories cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
