The scheme involves probabilistic encryption, which is a topic in Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also provides a corrected description of the scheme and a proof of correctness, which are related to Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The applications of the scheme involve multi-party computation and online poker, which are topics in Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Machine Learning (cs.LG), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
