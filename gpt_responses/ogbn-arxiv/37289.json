It also discusses the issue of untrusted nodes, which falls under the category of network security (cs.NI) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes a broadcast transformation, which involves limiting the number of transmissions per generation, and this is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the achievable transmission rate in the presence of adversaries, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
