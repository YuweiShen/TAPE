The paper proposes a new approach to introduce explicit phrase alignment into the translation process of arbitrary NMT models. This approach involves designing a new decoding algorithm that can impose lexical and structural constraints. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The proposed approach involves building a search space similar to that of phrase-based statistical machine translation, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
