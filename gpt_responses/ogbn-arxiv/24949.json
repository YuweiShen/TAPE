It also involves image processing and pattern recognition techniques. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as fiducial markers are commonly used in robot navigation and localization. \n\nThe graphics (cs.GR) sub-category is also a possibility as augmented reality (AR) is mentioned as one of the applications of fiducial markers. \n\nMultimedia (cs.MM) is another possible sub-category as fiducial markers are used in multimedia applications such as video tracking and augmented reality. \n\nFinally, computer graphics (cs.CG) is a possible sub-category as the paper mentions flexible shape design and marker detection algorithm, which are related to computer graphics techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
