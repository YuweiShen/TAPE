This aligns with the focus of the Programming Languages sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that pull-stream is a form of declarative concurrent programming, which suggests a potential connection to distributed and parallel computing.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the need for a formal specification to help programmers reason about the correctness of their implementations, which is a key concern in software engineering.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper presents a formalization for a specific design pattern, which involves defining a protocol language and reference modules. This aligns with the focus of the Logic in Computer Science sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): While the paper does not explicitly focus on data structures and algorithms, the pull-stream design pattern is used to create streaming applications, which may involve the use of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
