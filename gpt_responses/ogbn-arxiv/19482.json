The use of FCNs and dilated convolutions for segmentation is a technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of the VKH dataset, which is related to medical imaging (cs.MM). Finally, the use of neural networks for segmentation is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
