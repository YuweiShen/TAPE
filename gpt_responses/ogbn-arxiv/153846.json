The use of machine learning techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of a new perceptual similarity measure as the objective function could suggest that it could belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of CT images could suggest that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it deals with medical imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
