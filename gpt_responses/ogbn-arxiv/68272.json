This makes it likely to belong to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of computing the width of an automaton, which involves combinatorial and algorithmic aspects, making it relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) categories. The paper also mentions the use of automata in coBuchi games, which can be related to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
