The certificates of invariance are given in terms of Lyapunov inequalities, which are proven using sums of squares optimization. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with robot control tasks and presents a control design procedure that can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a given trajectory, input saturations, and uncertainty in the dynamics and state. This is a core area of robotics research.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of optimization techniques to design controllers can be seen as a form of machine learning. Additionally, the resulting controllers can be used by feedback motion planning algorithms, which can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with designing controllers for challenging robot control tasks, which can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the use of optimization techniques to design controllers can be seen as a form of AI.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention neural or evolutionary computing, the use of optimization techniques to"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
