Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and modulation formats, which are related to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of mutual information (MI), which is a topic related to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
