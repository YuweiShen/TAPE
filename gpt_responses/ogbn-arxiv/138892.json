The paper also mentions interior point methods (IPMs), which are commonly used in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA). The paper provides improved running times for maximum flow algorithms, which is a problem in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of smoothed $\\ell_2$-$\\ell_p$ flows, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Bregman divergence, which is a concept in information theory and signal processing (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
