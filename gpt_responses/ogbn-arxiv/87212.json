This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), social and information networks (cs.SI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper uses techniques from all of these areas to develop a data-driven pipeline for place deduplication, making it likely to be relevant to all of these sub-categories. However, given the focus on data management and similarity-based techniques, cs.DB and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
