This is a key concept in the field of dynamical systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The Koopman operator has been used in recent years as a tool for data-driven modeling and prediction, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a lifting technique to compute gramians in the space of full-state observables, which involves numerical computations and could be relevant to computational engineering and science. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This is the least likely category, but the paper does mention an example nonlinear system that models the spread of a disease, which could be seen as a network of interactions between individuals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
