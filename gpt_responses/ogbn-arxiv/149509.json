The paper discusses the use of joint learning models and negative sampling to improve the quality of training data. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with large scale datasets, which are often handled in the field of databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper discusses natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques for knowledge graph completion and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques for generating negative examples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
