This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category, as it deals with image classification using machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing machine learning classifiers, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses security concerns related to adversarial examples, which suggests that it may belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of adversarial examples to attack machine learning systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of cell-phone cameras to obtain adversarial images suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
