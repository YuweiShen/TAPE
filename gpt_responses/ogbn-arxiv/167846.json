The paper proposes a novel framework consisting of a constrained optimization-based force estimation and an optimization-based nonlinear controller to address the challenges of close proximity flights. This work involves robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
