The paper introduces a new generalization of straight skeletons and analyzes their properties. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also involves graphics and visualization, which makes cs.GR (Computer Graphics) another likely sub-category. The use of straight skeletons for generating roofs and terrains involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and data structures, which makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.GD (Discrete Mathematics) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
