The paper also discusses power control and user selection strategies, which are common in networked systems (cs.NI). The use of lattice decoding and alignment techniques suggests a focus on signal processing and coding (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of multiple antennas, which is a common topic in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses practical considerations such as power control, which suggests a focus on computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
