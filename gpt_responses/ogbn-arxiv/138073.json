Therefore, cs.AI and cs.HC are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves running randomized experiments and measuring the impact of different factors on model interpretability, which falls under the category of machine learning (LG) and cybersecurity (CY). Finally, the paper discusses the need for more empirical verification of interpretable models, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
