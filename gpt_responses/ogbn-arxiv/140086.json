The use of block coordinate gradient descent (BCGD) is also mentioned, which is a popular optimization method in the field. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of deep networks in computer vision (cs.CV) and the effects of depth and width on convergence, which suggests a possible fit for cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
