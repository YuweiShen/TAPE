The paper also mentions performance analysis in practical communication systems, which falls under networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of M-QAM signal inputs suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
