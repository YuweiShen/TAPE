This involves the use of regression techniques for inferring motor policy parameters corresponding to novel parameterized tasks, as well as exploration in the task space to efficiently learn distributions of parameterized motor skills/policies that solve a corresponding distribution of parameterized tasks/goals. These topics are closely related to robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
