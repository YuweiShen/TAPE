This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained models and fine-tuning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention the scarcity of annotated data, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR).
