Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) another likely category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new framework that exploits low-resolution video, which involves optimization techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible category. The paper also discusses the use of alternative fusion methods, which involves decision-making techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of leveraging information from different modalities, which involves security and privacy concerns, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
