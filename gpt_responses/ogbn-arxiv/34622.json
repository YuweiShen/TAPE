The proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of sources, including smooth sources (cs.MM) and Gaussian sources (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed scheme and the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, which is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and signal processing (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed scheme in image and video compression (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
