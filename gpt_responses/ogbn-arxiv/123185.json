The specific structured signal model studied in the paper - local sparsity in levels - has applications in compressive imaging (cs.CE), multi-sensor acquisition systems (cs.MM), and sparse regularization in inverse problems (cs.CV). Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
