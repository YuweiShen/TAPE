Specifically, the paper proposes a hybrid 3D CNN and 3D Convolutional LSTM model for extracting spatiotemporal features from 4D fMRI data and applies it to classify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from resting-state fMRI data. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as the paper deals with image analysis and deep learning techniques. The paper also involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for classification purposes. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) to some extent, as it discusses the use of clinical symptoms in the analysis of fMRI data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
