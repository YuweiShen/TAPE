The paper also proposes a new upper-bounding technique that utilizes noisy observation of interfering signals, which is related to network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of time sharing and Gaussian signaling, which are common techniques in communication systems (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of additive noise, which is a topic in multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed schemes at high SNR, which is related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
