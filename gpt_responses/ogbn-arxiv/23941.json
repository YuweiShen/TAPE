This involves analyzing the bias and variance of the estimator, and characterizing its maximum $L_2$ risk. The techniques used involve concentration inequalities, approximation using positive linear operators, and sample complexity analysis. These topics are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), statistics (cs.ST), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
