It also involves the use of distributional semantics, which is a common technique used in IR. It could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves natural language processing techniques. The use of centroid vectors and machine learning algorithms also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the experiments conducted in this paper involve the use of datasets and statistical analysis, which could also place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
