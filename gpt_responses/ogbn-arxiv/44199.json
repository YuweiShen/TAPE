The use of random Fourier features and the focus on distributed learning over networks suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses conditions for asymptotic convergence and boundness of the networkwise regret, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
