This falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper discusses parallel algorithms (cs.AL) and data mining (cs.DM) in the context of write-efficient sorting. The use of cache-oblivious algorithms also suggests a potential connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
