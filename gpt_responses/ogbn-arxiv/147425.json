The paper also discusses the limitations of the two known general constructions of linear MRD codes, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The construction of MRD codes involves algebraic structures, which could be related to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also presents a new family of codes, which could be of interest to researchers working on machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.SI) and the study of linear codes (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
