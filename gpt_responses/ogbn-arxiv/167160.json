The paper also proposes a novel approach for optimizing filter size in CNNs, which involves learning the filter sizes and weights simultaneously from the training data, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates its proposed approach on two AU-coded spontaneous databases, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
