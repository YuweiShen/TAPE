This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR). The use of panoramic depth maps and autoencoder-based compression also suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the development of pixel-wise feature descriptors and end-to-end learning scheme indicates a potential overlap with artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
