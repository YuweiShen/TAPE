The paper specifically focuses on shallow ReLU networks, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
