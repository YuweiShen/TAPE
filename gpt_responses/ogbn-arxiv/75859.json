The paper also discusses the use of partitions and cost functions to accurately track resource usage, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AR). The paper presents algorithms for solving the fusion problem, which is a software engineering (cs.SE) problem, and discusses the complexity of finding the optimal solution, which is related to computational complexity and algorithms (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
