The paper discusses connections to existing literature on black-box optimization and 'RL as an inference'. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it deals with the development of algorithms and models that can learn from and make predictions on data. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper discusses RL, which is a subfield of AI, and cs.RO (Robotics) as the paper evaluates the algorithm on continuous control tasks. Additionally, cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible sub-categories as the paper discusses policy iteration schemes and evolutionary strategies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
