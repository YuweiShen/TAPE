However, the algorithms are based on methods for solving systems of polynomial inequalities, which suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and optimization. Therefore, likely sub-categories include cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.IT (information theory), cs.CG (computational geometry), cs.NA (numerical analysis), and cs.SY (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
