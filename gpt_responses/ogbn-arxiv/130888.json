Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses over-fitting and over-smoothing, which are common issues in deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments involve several benchmarks, including image datasets, which could suggest cs.CV (Computer Vision) as another possible sub-category. The paper also mentions natural language processing (NLP) datasets, indicating that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper proposes a general technique that can be applied to different backbone models, which could suggest cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
