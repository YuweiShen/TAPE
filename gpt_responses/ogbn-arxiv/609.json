The paper discusses the limitations of MLNs in expressing certain types of statistics and proposes a solution through the introduction of statistical universal quantifiers. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), computational linguistics (cs.CL), social and information networks (cs.SI), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
