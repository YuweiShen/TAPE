This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The paper also mentions integer programming and network flow, which are topics in discrete mathematics and graph theory, respectively. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-categories.
