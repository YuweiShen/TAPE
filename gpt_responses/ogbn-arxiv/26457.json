This suggests a focus on distributed and parallel computing, which falls under this sub-category. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper examines the use of container technology for software distribution and execution, which is a key aspect of software engineering. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of containers for Python code, which falls under this sub-category. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper focuses on the distribution and execution of scientific computing software, which is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): While not a primary focus of the paper, the use of containers for scientific computing could potentially be relevant to this sub-category, particularly in the context of distributed training of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
