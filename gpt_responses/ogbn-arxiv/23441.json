The proposed framework involves discriminative learning, which is a common approach in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. The paper also discusses the limitations of classical density estimation approaches, which are commonly used in cryptography (CR) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
