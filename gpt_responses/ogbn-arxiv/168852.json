The paper specifically focuses on non-compositional phrases, which are phrases whose meaning cannot be composed from the individual meanings of their terms. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of unsupervised models and Markov Random Fields, which are techniques commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), suggesting that the paper may also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Computation and Language (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
