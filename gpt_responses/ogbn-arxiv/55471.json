This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as operating systems (cs.OS) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also proposes a novel IPC confinement mechanism, which involves designing and implementing a system, making it relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
