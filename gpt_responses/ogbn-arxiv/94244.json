Specifically, cs.DL (Digital Libraries) is a likely category as the paper deals with mapping the flow of knowledge across time, which is a common topic in digital libraries. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is also a likely category as the paper discusses the movement of researchers from one area to another, which can be analyzed using network analysis techniques. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is another possible category as the paper discusses the evolution of research interests over time, which is a topic that is relevant to the design of information systems. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a possible category as the paper discusses the quantification of research interests, which is a topic that is relevant to information retrieval. Finally, cs.SD (Software Engineering) is a possible category as the paper discusses the evolution of research interests over time, which is a topic that is relevant to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
