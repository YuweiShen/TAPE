The proposed approach employs an SMC protocol based on functional encryption, which is a cryptographic technique.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with federated learning, which is a machine learning technique. The proposed approach aims to improve the efficiency of federated learning while preserving privacy.\n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes an approach for federated learning, which is a distributed computing paradigm. The proposed approach employs an SMC protocol, which is a distributed computing technique.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with privacy-preserving federated learning, which is a societal concern. The proposed approach aims to preserve privacy while improving the efficiency of federated learning.\n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with federated learning, which is a networked system. The proposed approach aims to improve the efficiency of federated learning while preserving privacy in a networked environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
