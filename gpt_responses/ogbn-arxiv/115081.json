It addresses a fundamental mode of failure related to numerical stiffness and proposes a learning rate annealing algorithm and a novel neural network architecture to mitigate this issue. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
