The paper proposes a new algorithm that addresses the problem of Q-value overestimation in deep reinforcement learning. This algorithm is based on concepts from information theory, which is a subfield of computer science that deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves control theory, which is a subfield of engineering that deals with the control of dynamical systems. Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for deep reinforcement learning, which involves neural networks and optimization. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
