The paper also proposes a novel multitask learning network, which involves training the network to perform two complementary tasks simultaneously, namely, segmenting vehicle regions and detecting semantic boundaries. This involves using techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the theoretical analysis of residual networks, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes a new data set for vehicle instance segmentation, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
