This could fall under several sub-categories, but the most likely are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). The use of AVX2 instructions on recent Intel processors suggests a focus on hardware optimization. Other possible sub-categories include cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.SE (Software Engineering), as the paper discusses the implementation of software that abides by the base64 specification and reports errors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
