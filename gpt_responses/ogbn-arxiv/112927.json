The paper also mentions concepts such as multi-scale feature learning, which is a common technique used in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also mentions dense connections of network layers, which is a concept commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses weighting different network flows, which is a concept commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nThe paper evaluates the developed network in unconstrained face matching, which is a task commonly associated with multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the capability of learning complex data distributions caused by face images with various qualities, which is a concept commonly associated with neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
