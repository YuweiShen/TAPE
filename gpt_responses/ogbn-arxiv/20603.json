This involves the use of a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Deep-Learning (PoDL), which requires the generation of a proper deep learning model to produce a valid proof for a new block. This aspect of the paper relates to the security and privacy of blockchain systems, which is a key focus of the cs.CR sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a new blockchain design that aims to improve the energy efficiency of PoW-based cryptocurrencies by recycling the energy required for maintaining the blockchain and using it for deep learning computation. This involves the use of a new consensus mechanism called PoDL, which requires the generation of a proper deep learning model to produce a valid proof for a new block.
