The use of stochastic dominance and bijective analysis also suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes a new concept, the bijective ratio, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
