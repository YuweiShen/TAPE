The paper also presents algorithms for solving the problem on different types of graphs, which falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and theoretical computer science (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper discusses the weighted and unweighted versions of the problem, which could be relevant to topics in social networks and machine learning, falling under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
