This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new approach to optimize the implementation of deep learning algorithms on IoT devices, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for further optimization using table look-up operations, which could fall under embedded systems (cs.EM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
