Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses transfer learning with pre-trained BERT models, which is a popular technique in deep learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves training neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions using back-translations, which is a common technique in computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
