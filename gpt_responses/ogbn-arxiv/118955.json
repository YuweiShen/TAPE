This falls under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SD) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also involves the use of spatial grids and sensitivity analysis, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which could also fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
