The focus of the paper is on providing evidence on the trustworthiness of predictions made by black box models, which is related to the field of explainable AI (XAI) and can be categorized under cs.CR (security and privacy). The paper also discusses the use of visualization techniques to aid domain experts in processing alerts, which can be categorized under cs.HC (human-computer interaction). Additionally, the paper uses case-based reasoning (CBR) to provide evidence on the trustworthiness of predictions, which can be categorized under cs.IR (information retrieval) as CBR is a technique used in information retrieval. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of local post-hoc explanations of predictions, which is related to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
