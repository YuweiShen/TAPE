This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT), communication systems (cs.COMM), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the impact of channel correlation on performance, which is related to system dynamics and control (cs.SY) and modeling and simulation (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
