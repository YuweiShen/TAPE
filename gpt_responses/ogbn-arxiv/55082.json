This involves converting the system of three unbalanced phasors into symmetrical components and utilizing the Chow-Liu algorithm to find the optimal topology. The paper also addresses the challenge of identifying bus phase connections using voltage measurements. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are systems and control (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), software engineering (cs.SE), and power and energy (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
