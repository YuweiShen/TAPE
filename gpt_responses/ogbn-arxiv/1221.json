The paper introduces a new approach to language modeling using nearest neighbor search, which is a common technique in machine learning and information retrieval. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks and linear interpolation, which are relevant to categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of nearest neighbor search for scaling up to larger training sets and domain adaptation, which are relevant to categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
