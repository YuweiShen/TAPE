This suggests a focus on the societal implications of MR, making cs.CY a likely category. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses how to build an immersive web that encourages ethical development and usage, which is a key concern of HCI. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): While the paper notes that MR is beyond emerging, it still occupies a space that is not quite entrenched. As such, it may still be relevant to consider ethical assessments of research and innovation, which is a focus of cs.ET. \n- cs.WEB (Web Technologies): The paper specifically discusses building an immersive web, which falls under the purview of cs.WEB. \n- cs.HCI (Human-Computer Interaction): Similar to cs.HC, the paper's focus on building an immersive web that encourages ethical development and usage suggests a focus on HCI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
