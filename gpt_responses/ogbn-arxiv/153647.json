The paper also discusses the use of hybrid analog/digital precoder and combiner, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed channel tracking technique involves updating the precoder and combiner sequentially, which can be considered as a control system (cs.SY) problem. Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of the proposed technique with the 3GPP specification, which can be categorized under computer communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
