It may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it involves processing historical documents and manuscripts. Deep learning (cs.DL) could also be a relevant sub-category as many recent advances in image analysis have been achieved through deep learning techniques. Multimedia (cs.MM) could also be a possible sub-category as the paper deals with processing images. Finally, human-computer interaction (cs.HC) could be a relevant sub-category as the paper deals with evaluating the performance of algorithms on historical documents, which may have implications for user interfaces and accessibility."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
