The paper also discusses the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common issue in deep learning (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper includes experimental comparisons of threshold networks and ReLU networks, which are both used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the promotion of sparsity in learned parameters, which is a topic in sparse coding and compressed sensing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
