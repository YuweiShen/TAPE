The proposed approach involves learning a lower-dimensional latent space and estimating the latent dynamics for control. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of locally-linear control also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves decoding and prediction tasks, which may be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
