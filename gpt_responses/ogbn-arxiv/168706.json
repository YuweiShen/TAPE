This involves proposing an effective algorithm and presenting intuitive visual analysis of the recommendation results. The paper's emphasis on network science, team optimization, and visual analysis suggests that it could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Computers and Society (cs.CY), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
