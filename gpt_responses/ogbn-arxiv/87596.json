The paper also discusses optimization algorithms and decision functions, which are topics typically studied in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions distillation from CNN to CTE architecture, which involves transferring knowledge from one neural network to another, a topic commonly studied in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on standard object recognition benchmarks, which is a common evaluation metric in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
