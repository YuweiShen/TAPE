The use of fixed parameter algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the area of parameterized complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the problem of betweenness tournament involves graph theory and optimization, which could place the paper in the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) or graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
