The proposed method uses a multitask learning framework, which involves training multiple models simultaneously, and this is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks, which are a popular tool in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its method on standard benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
