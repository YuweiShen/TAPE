The paper evaluates a range of textual representations for their capacity to address issues related to lexical composition, such as meaning shift and implicit information. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques for text representation, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe evaluation tasks involve detecting meaning shift and recovering implicit information, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these two sub-categories are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
