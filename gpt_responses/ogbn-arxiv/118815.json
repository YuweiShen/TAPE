The paper specifically focuses on the practical implementation methods and enabling technologies of deep learning in edge computing frameworks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and distributed and parallel computing (cs.DC). The application scenarios mentioned in the paper, such as face recognition and smart factories, are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges and future trends of more pervasive and fine-grained intelligence, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
