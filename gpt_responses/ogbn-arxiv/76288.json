The focus is on reducing the number of parameters required by these networks without affecting their performance. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and signal processing (cs.SI). However, given the emphasis on deep architectures and weight initialization, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
