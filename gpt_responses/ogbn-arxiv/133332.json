The paper also mentions computer vision (cs.CV) as a specific application area where adversarial attacks are of particular concern. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of previous methods and proposes a new approach, which involves optimizing a coefficient derived from theoretical analysis, indicating a strong theoretical foundation and potential relevance to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the use of query feedback, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
