It also mentions forbidden crossing configurations, which is a concept in graph theory (cs.DS). The paper surveys known results and open problems, which suggests that it may fall under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of geometric representations of graphs also has connections to graph theory and combinatorics (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the application of graph drawing to real-world problems, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
