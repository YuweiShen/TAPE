The paper also discusses pruning techniques for compressing these architectures, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of ResNet feature extractors, which is a popular architecture in multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the design scenarios for exploiting pruning methods, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the experimental results obtained using multiple benchmarks, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
