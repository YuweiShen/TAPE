The proposed Plug-and-Play scheme is also applied to image denoising, which is a common task in computer vision. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the conversion of Poisson random variables to Gaussian ones, which is a topic in information theory. The paper also discusses the use of convex programming, which is a common tool in information theory. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses image restoration and denoising, which are common tasks in multimedia processing. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper discusses the use of numerical methods for solving inverse problems with Poisson noise contamination. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Although less likely, the paper could potentially be categorized under cs.SI as it discusses the use of a modular approach that allows other developers to plug in their own algorithms, which is a common theme in social and information networks research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
