Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of adapter modules, which are a type of neural network architecture, so it could also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses the BERT Transformer model, which is a type of deep learning model commonly used in computer vision, so it could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses parameter efficiency, which is a common concern in neural network optimization, so it could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
