The use of barrier functions is a common approach in the control and robotics community for ensuring safety in dynamical systems. The paper proposes a method for designing policies for MPOMDPs that ensure safety using discrete-time barrier functions. Therefore, the paper is likely to be classified under cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
