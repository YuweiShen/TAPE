The paper also discusses the use of sparsity in the selection of feedback symbols, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents an algorithm for DFE that involves convex relaxation, which is a topic that falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
