The most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper specifically mentions training strategies and model selection. The next likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as supervised learning is a fundamental concept in AI. The paper also mentions multi-label problems, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions distributed task execution, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
