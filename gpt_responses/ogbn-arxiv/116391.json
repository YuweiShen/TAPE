It also heavily relies on Fourier series and Parseval's identity, which are concepts from information theory (cs.IT). The protocol is based on arithmetic circuits, which are a topic in computer science theory (cs.DS) and circuit complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper introduces a new kind of multiparty computation protocol, which could be considered a contribution to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
