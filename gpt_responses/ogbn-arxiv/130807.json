The use of analogical inference is a novel approach to this task, which suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the proposed neural network architecture and sentence embeddings suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on benchmark datasets suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) commonly used in NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
