The primary focus is on cybersecurity (cs.CR), as the paper discusses malware detection and reducing false positives. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as feature vectors and statistical analysis, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of dynamic neighborhoods and correlations between nodes, which are relevant to social networks and network science (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of per-machine detectors, which are relevant to network infrastructure (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
