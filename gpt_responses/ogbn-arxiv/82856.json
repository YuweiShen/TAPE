Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses applications in health care and security, which suggests that it could also fall under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves developing a method to estimate breathing rate despite motion interference, which could fall under cs.MA (Machine Learning) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
