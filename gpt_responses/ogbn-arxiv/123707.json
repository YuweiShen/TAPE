The use of conditional generative networks and differentiable guidance also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experimental results and ablation studies involve the evaluation of 3D reconstruction, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
