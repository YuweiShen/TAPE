The paper proposes a polar coding scheme for this problem, which is a well-known technique in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with the problem of secure communication, which is a core topic in cryptography and security. The paper proposes a coding scheme that ensures strong secrecy and randomness constraints, which are important properties in cryptography and security. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of communication over a broadcast channel, which is a common scenario in social and information networks. The paper proposes a coding scheme that can be used in such networks to ensure secure communication. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper proposes a low-complexity coding scheme, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity. The paper also discusses the trade-off between complexity and performance in the proposed scheme. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but the proposed coding scheme can be used for secure transmission of multimedia data over a broadcast channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
