Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and channel capacity, which are key aspects of the proposed framework. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a communication system for mmWave bands, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. The proposed framework involves establishing UE pairs for NOMA transmission and selecting proper UE for single user transmission, which are important networking aspects. \n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a novel communication strategy for mmWave bands using limited feedback and non-orthogonal signaling. The proposed framework involves establishing UE pairs for NOMA transmission and selecting proper UE for single user transmission, which are key aspects of communication systems. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel hybrid strategy, called combined NOMA, for the circumstances with no UE pair through two-bit NOMA. This involves designing a control system for selecting the appropriate transmission strategy based on the feedback received from the UE. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of a communication system for mmWave bands, which is a key area of research in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
