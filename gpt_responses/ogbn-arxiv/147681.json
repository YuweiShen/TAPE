Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of Bayesian methods for modeling uncertainty in DNNs, which is a common topic in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of dropout and dropconnect techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) research. Finally, the paper discusses the use of these techniques for robustly representing uncertainty, which suggests that it may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
