The method involves quantization and compression, which are also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper uses a rate-distortion function to minimize the impact of quantization on accuracy, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
