The use of neural networks to approximate the function also suggests the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper discusses the optimization procedure to find a sparse network embedded in a dense network, which is a common problem in the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The function being approximated is a sum of squares, which is a common form of loss function in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of explicit regularization to control the generalization gap, which is a common topic in the subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
