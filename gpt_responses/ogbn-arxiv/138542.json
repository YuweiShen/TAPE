The paper also mentions the use of these codes in cryptosystems, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper's focus on Goppa codes, which are a type of algebraic code, suggests that it could also be classified under coding theory (cs.CC). The mention of high probability suggests a probabilistic approach, which could fall under the category of randomized algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's potential applications in cryptography suggest that it could also be classified under the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
