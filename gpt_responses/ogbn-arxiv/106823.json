The use of a Simple recurrent Network to predict the next character in text suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the task of recognizing spans of text containing programming language code suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
