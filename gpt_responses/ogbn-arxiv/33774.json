The paper proposes a framework that takes into account the human's safety perception, which is a key aspect of human-robot interaction. This involves estimation of uncertain parameters of the safety perception model based on test data collected using Virtual Reality (VR) testbed, and offline optimal control computation using the estimated safety perception model. The paper also proposes the use of Hidden Markov models (HMM) to address the unknown factors in the human tests data. Overall, the paper covers topics related to robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
