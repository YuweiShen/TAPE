It specifically focuses on arithmetic circuits, which are a type of data structure (cs.DS) commonly used in computation. The paper also discusses the use of cryptographic primitives, such as homomorphic encryption, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The goal of the paper is to minimize the number of black-box calls and communication overhead, which involves optimization techniques commonly used in algorithms and complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the possibility of extending the protocols to multiparty computation, which is a topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
