This involves active sensing scenarios that account for robot pose uncertainty. The paper proposes a new utility function that couples localization and field mapping objectives, enabling exploration against exploitation in a principled way. The paper also presents extensive simulations and a proof of concept in an indoor temperature mapping scenario. Given these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
