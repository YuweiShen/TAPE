It also discusses combination mechanisms for algebraic effects, which are important for modular design of programming languages and verification logics. These topics are closely related to programming languages (cs.PL), logic (cs.LO), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
