The paper provides insights into the behavior of neural networks with different activation functions, which is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science. Based on the abstract, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions practical datasets and ReLU-like networks, which suggest relevance to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
