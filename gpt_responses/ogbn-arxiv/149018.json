The experiments are also conducted on large-scale image datasets. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel teacher-student framework for semi-supervised hashing, which involves training a neural network. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on the problem of similarity retrieval, which is a key area of research in information retrieval. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The experiments are conducted on large-scale image datasets, which falls under the domain of multimedia. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper discusses the use of pairwise information for training the student network, which involves natural language processing techniques such as similarity measures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
