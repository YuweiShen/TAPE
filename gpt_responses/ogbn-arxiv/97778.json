The paper focuses on privacy requirements and presents a new dVPN called VPN0 that guarantees strong privacy guarantees and minimal performance impact on its users. The paper discusses attestation mechanisms, zero knowledge proofs, and dynamic chains of VPN tunnels. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other possible categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
