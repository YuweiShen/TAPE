Therefore, it is likely to belong to the database (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. The evaluation complexity of CXRPQs is also discussed, which suggests a possible connection to the complexity theory (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper compares CXRPQs with other query languages, which could relate to the formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the paper introduces a user-friendly approach to graph queries, which could be relevant to the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
