The use of convolutional neural networks and objective functions also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The discussion about the best objective function for sparse data also suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of magnetic resonance angiography images suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
