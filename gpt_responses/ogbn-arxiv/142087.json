The focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) is evident in the proposed hint-guided approach, which encourages workers to seek help when unsure of questions. The use of machine learning models and the need for well-annotated data suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CY). The proposed payment mechanism and the emphasis on identifying high-quality workers suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of social and information networks (cs.SI) and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
