This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of these methods in part-of-speech tagging, which is a common task in natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of committee-based methods, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper describes empirical methods for sample selection, which is a common technique in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
