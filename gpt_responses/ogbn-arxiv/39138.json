The paper also discusses the implications of blockchain on customs and governmental agencies, which further supports the relevance of this paper to the cs.CY sub-category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Blockchain is a technology that relies heavily on cryptography and security mechanisms to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data. This paper discusses the security implications of blockchain in supply chain management, which makes it relevant to the cs.CR sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although this paper does not focus on machine learning, it does discuss the potential of blockchain to facilitate digitisation and enhance traceability in supply chain management. These are areas where machine learning techniques can be applied, which makes this paper relevant to the cs.LG sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Blockchain is a technology that requires software engineering expertise to develop and deploy. This paper discusses the challenges in enabling the wide scale deployment of blockchain in global supply chain management, which makes it relevant to the cs.SE sub-category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): Blockchain is a distributed database technology that enables secure and transparent data sharing among multiple parties. This paper discusses the potential of blockchain to improve supply chain management by securing chain-of-custody, which makes it relevant to the cs.DB"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
