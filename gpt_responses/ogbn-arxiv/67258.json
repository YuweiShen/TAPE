The paper focuses on optimizing the teaching examples to balance the future loss of the learner and the effort of the teacher. This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
