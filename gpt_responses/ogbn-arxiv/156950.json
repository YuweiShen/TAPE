Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new scaling method and uses neural architecture search, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the models on transfer learning datasets, which could fall under cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper uses a compound coefficient to scale all dimensions of depth/width/resolution, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
