Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the reconstruction of input from output, which is a problem in signal processing and machine learning, making cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of Fano-type bounds, which are commonly used in communication and control systems, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper provides examples of systems, including a multi-channel autocorrelation receiver, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
