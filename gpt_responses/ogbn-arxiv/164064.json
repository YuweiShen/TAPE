The incorporation of additional sensors and electronics for autonomous navigation suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the cost-efficient design and use of off-the-shelf components may also involve machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for optimization and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
