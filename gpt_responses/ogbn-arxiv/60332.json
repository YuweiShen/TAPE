The paper also discusses the use of knowledge distillation, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of catastrophic forgetting, which is a common issue in neural networks and falls under the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses bias in classifiers, which is a topic that falls under the subfield of natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
