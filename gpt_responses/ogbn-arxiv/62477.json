It also involves planning and decision-making, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of graph transformation systems (GTS) is related to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL), and the management of software architecture is related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a heuristic for solving planning problems, which is related to logic and verification (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
