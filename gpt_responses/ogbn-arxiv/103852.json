This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with computing similarity measures between nodes in a network, which is a core topic in social and information networks. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper derives closed-form expressions for computing expectations of co-presences and co-occurrences of nodes on paths sampled from a network. This involves algorithmic and data structure considerations. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes new similarity measures between nodes in a network, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with computing similarity measures between nodes in a network, which is a core topic in networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
