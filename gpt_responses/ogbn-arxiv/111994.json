This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the effects of turbulence on the FSO link, which falls under the category of optics (cs.OH). Additionally, the paper presents closed-form expressions for various performance metrics, which involves mathematical analysis (cs.PF) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
