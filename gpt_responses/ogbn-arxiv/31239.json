The authors propose a new dataset of 100,000 image-text pairs randomly crawled from Twitter, which is used to evaluate the performance of various subspace learning methods and text features. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of cross-media retrieval, which is a subfield of information retrieval that involves searching for relevant information across different modalities (e.g., text, image, video). The authors propose a weakly supervised learning approach that only uses text-image pairs during training. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions that the text in the Twitter100k dataset is written in informal language by the users, which poses a challenge for natural language processing. The authors experiment with various text features to improve the performance of cross-media retrieval. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of cross-media retrieval, which is a key task in multimedia analysis. The authors propose a new dataset of image-text pairs from Twitter, which is more diverse and realistic than existing datasets. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a weakly supervised learning approach for cross-media retrieval, which only uses text-image pairs during training. The authors experiment with various subspace learning methods and variants of the Correspondence Auto"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
