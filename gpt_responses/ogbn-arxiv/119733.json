This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of standard architectures and fine-tuning pretrained networks, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The evaluation of the approach on fine-grained recognition datasets and an imbalanced video dataset suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
