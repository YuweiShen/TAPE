The focus of the paper is on optimizing the performance of CNNs through the use of reduced-precision representations, which is a common technique in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Augmented Reality (cs.AR) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the use of FPGAs for implementing low-precision inference engines, which is relevant to the field of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
