The robots operate asynchronously and are limited in terms of memory and communication, which are typical characteristics of distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also proposes algorithms to solve the exploration task, which involves coordination and control of the robots, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
