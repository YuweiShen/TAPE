It analyzes the client interactive behavior when accessing real multimedia systems and proposes an algorithm based on this analysis. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on peer-to-peer swarming protocols and their efficiency for content replication over the Internet. It proposes a peer selection policy algorithm that considers interactive scenarios, which is relevant to the networking and internet architecture field. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper analyzes the workloads of real content providers and assesses metrics related to temporal and spatial dispersion and object position popularity, which are important for multimedia systems. The proposed algorithm is aimed at improving the performance of on-demand streaming systems, which is also relevant to multimedia research. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with peer-to-peer protocols and their adaptation to on-demand streaming systems, which involves distributed and parallel computing. The proposed algorithm is intended to improve the efficiency of content replication and distribution, which is also relevant to cluster computing. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the peer selection policies for BitTorrent-like protocols, which are based on social networks of peers sharing content. The proposed algorithm takes into account"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
