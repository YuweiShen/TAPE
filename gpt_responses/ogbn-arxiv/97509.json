This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of indoor lighting systems for downlink communications and proposes a modulation technique for VLC systems. This is relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper focuses on improving the performance of VLC systems using HCM, which is a communication technique. This falls under the scope of communications and networking.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of HCM and DCR-HCM can be seen as a form of optimization to improve the performance of VLC systems. This could potentially fall under the scope of machine learning.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of interleaving to make the resulting signals more resistant against inter-symbol interference (ISI) in dispersive VLC links. This falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
