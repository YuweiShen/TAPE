Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with multi-camera systems, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also involves tracking, which could place it in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
