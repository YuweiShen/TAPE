The use of memory-augmented neural networks also involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The evaluation of the proposed models involves measuring performance metrics such as BLEU score, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of attentional encoder-decoder models, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
