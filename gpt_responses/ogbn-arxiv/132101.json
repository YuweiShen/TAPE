The proposed method involves the aggregation of features from multiple frames, which is a common technique in deep learning and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of optical flow, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for feature aggregation, which involves clustering, a technique commonly used in unsupervised learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
