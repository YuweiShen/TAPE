Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), which deals with algorithms and software for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. Other likely sub-categories include cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry), which may also be relevant depending on the specific methods and techniques used in the package."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
