The use of automated fare collection (AFC) data also involves the analysis of large-scale data, which is a common theme in social and information networks research.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed framework for path choice estimation involves optimization and decomposition of the original problem into tractable sub-problems, which can be seen as a machine learning approach. The use of synthetic data and real-world AFC data also involves data-driven modeling and analysis, which is a common theme in machine learning research.\n\n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper deals with the optimization and estimation of path choices in metro systems, which can be considered as a computational engineering problem. The use of AFC data also involves the analysis of large-scale data, which is a common theme in computational science research.\n\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the analysis of data from automated fare collection (AFC) systems, which involves the processing and transmission of information.
