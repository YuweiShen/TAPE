This falls under the domain of AI. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper mentions the use of machine vision to estimate object location, which is a key component of computer vision. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of controlling the risk of collision in human-centred environments, which is a problem in systems and control. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an algorithm to efficiently compute the risk of collision, which involves the use of a \"convolution trick\". This could be seen as a machine learning technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
