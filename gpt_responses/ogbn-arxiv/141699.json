The proposed dynamic power splitting scheme involves adjusting power levels based on channel conditions, which is a control engineering problem (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the comparison of different power splitting schemes, which involves performance evaluation and measurement (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of the proposed scheme to multiple antennas, which is related to communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
