The paper focuses on the use of sparse reconstruction algorithms to formulate the precoding/combining problem as a sparse reconstruction problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. Additionally, the paper deals with the use of large antenna arrays and beamforming, which are typically used in wireless networks, suggesting that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also deals with the use of analog processing in the RF domain, which is a topic that falls under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also deals with the use of mmWave systems, which is a topic that falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the use of algorithms to approximate optimal unconstrained precoders and combiners, which is a topic that falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
