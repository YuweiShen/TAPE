Additionally, the paper discusses the issue of catastrophic forgetting, which is a problem that arises in many types of learning algorithms and is often addressed using techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The pole balancing task mentioned in the abstract is a classic problem in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of pseudorehearsal is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, which suggests that this subfield may also be relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
