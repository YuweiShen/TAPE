The proposed algorithm is based on RRT*, which is a popular algorithm in robotics and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also involves processing visual information, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The problem of autonomous parking is also related to system control and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes improvements to the RRT* algorithm, which is a machine learning algorithm (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
