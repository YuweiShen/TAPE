The paper also deals with challenges in handling complex ego-motion of handheld cameras, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO). The proposed optical-flow based training paradigm involves machine learning techniques, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with handling non-texture regions, which is a topic in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
