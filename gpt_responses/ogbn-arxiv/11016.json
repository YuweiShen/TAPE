The paper also discusses the use of mutation operators and power schedules, which are common topics in software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The focus on exploring input domains and exposing vulnerabilities suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY), while the use of high-level structural representations and novel mutation operators suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
