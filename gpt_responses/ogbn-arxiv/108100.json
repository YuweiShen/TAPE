The paper also proposes a novel optimization strategy for training the network, which falls under the category of machine learning, specifically deep learning, hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also likely. The paper also involves the use of peak and non-peak samples, which can be considered as a form of data augmentation, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a possible category. The paper also uses two popular facial expression recognition datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, which fall under the category of multimedia, hence cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with facial expression recognition, which is a human-computer interaction task, hence cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
