Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on large-scale noisy datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
