The paper proposes a framework for robust RL that draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions applications in robotics, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics and Control). The experiments conducted in the paper involve Atari games, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
