This involves joint routing and scheduling algorithms, overlay-based enforcement mechanisms, and integration with SDN controllers and Apache YARN. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
