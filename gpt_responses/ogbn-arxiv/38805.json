Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) since optical flow estimation is an important task in robotics. Finally, the paper experiments with action classification, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
