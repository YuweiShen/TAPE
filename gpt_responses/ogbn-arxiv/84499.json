Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary focus of the paper. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of small cell base stations (SBSs) to orchestrate FL among mobile users (MUs) within their cells, which falls under the category of network infrastructure (NI) in cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of gradient sparsification and periodic averaging to increase communication efficiency, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (DC) in cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the use of a hierarchical FL framework, which falls under the category of control systems (SY) in cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper uses the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate the proposed solution, which falls under the category of multimedia (MM) in cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
