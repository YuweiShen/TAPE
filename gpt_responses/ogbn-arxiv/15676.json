The construction of hard-to-test properties involves the use of combinatorial structures such as hypergraphs and expander graphs, which are typical objects of study in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses techniques from information theory, such as the probabilistically checkable proof (PCP) theorem, which is a fundamental result in coding theory and complexity theory (cs.IT). The results on separations between different testing models involve the analysis of error-correcting codes and their properties, which are relevant to both information theory and cryptography (cs.LG, cs.CR). Overall, the paper touches on several subfields of computer science and could be classified under multiple categories, but the ones listed above seem to be the most relevant and likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
