Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with the exploration-exploitation trade-off, which is a fundamental problem in Reinforcement Learning, and uses upper confidence bound (UCB) based exploration. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses a neural network-based random feature mapping to construct the UCB, which is a technique commonly used in Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
