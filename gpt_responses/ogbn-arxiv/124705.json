The paper also discusses the use of adaptive feedback and iterative learning, which are common topics in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper proposes a theoretical framework for improving trajectory tracking, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper includes experiments with a quadrotor, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
