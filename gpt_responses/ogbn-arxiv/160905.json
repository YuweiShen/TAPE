The paper also focuses on continuous control tasks, which are often studied in Robotics (cs.RO). The paper's emphasis on the robustness of the proposed method suggests that it could be relevant to Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's use of Recurrent Neural Networks suggests that it could be relevant to Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
