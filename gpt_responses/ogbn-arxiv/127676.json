The use of the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy is a common technique in optimization and theoretical computer science, which suggests the paper could also be categorized under cs.IT. The paper also deals with statistical estimation problems, which could fall under cs.DS or cs.SI. Finally, the paper's focus on algorithms and computational complexity suggests it could also be categorized under cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
