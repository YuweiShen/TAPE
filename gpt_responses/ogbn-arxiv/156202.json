The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas and multiple carriers, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The analysis of the impact of channel asymmetry on performance can be considered as a system-level study (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of linear estimators and robust design, which are related to communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
