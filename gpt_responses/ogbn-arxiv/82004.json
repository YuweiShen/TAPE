This involves optimizing system performance while minimizing interference to both cellular and other D2D links. The paper utilizes techniques from machine learning, optimization, and communication systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory) for the optimization aspect, cs.LG (Machine Learning) for the deep reinforcement learning technique, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the use of intelligent agents, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) for the system-level approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
