This involves algorithms for multiple mean-payoff objectives, generating strategies, and exploring them for simulation. The paper also presents a new practical algorithm for the analysis of MDPs with multiple mean-payoff objectives under memoryless strategies. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
