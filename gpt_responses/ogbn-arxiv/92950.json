Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it discusses the limitations of expressing norms in Linear Time Temporal Logic. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) as it discusses the syntax and semantics of temporal logic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
