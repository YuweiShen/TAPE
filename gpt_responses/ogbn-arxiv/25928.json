The paper also addresses issues such as delayed reward and action asynchronism through the use of evolutionary strategy. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
