The paper also mentions the use of undirected graphs (Markov networks) for representing conditional additive independence, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of the functional form derived from conditional additive independence, which is related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
