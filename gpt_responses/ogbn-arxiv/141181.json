The use of rectilinear edges and the focus on human readability also suggest a possible connection to visualization (cs.HC). However, since the paper does not explicitly discuss user studies or interface design, we do not include cs.HC in the list of likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
