This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of distributed computation and scalability also suggests the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant for extracting local observations from demonstration trajectories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
