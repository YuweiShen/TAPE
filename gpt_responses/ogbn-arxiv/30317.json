Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses the use of these rules in databases, which suggests cs.DB (Databases) as another likely category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of these rules in artificial intelligence, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a possible category.
