Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also proposes a heuristic algorithm and evaluates it empirically, which suggests that it could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The problem of maximizing the crossing angle can also be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem, which could place the paper under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper mentions that the problem of deciding whether a graph has a straight-line drawing with a crossing angle of 90 degrees is NP-hard, which could place it under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
