This topic is closely related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of scalar oracles to generalize the assumption of unique node identifiers also involves information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the leakage of information and its impact on security, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the study of local decision problems is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
