The paper discusses lower bounds for PAC learning under evasion attacks, which is a problem that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of poisoning attacks in conjunction with evasion attacks, which is a topic that falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper uses examples from image classification, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses sample complexity, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
