Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which includes research on natural language processing and information retrieval. The paper also discusses the evaluation of the tool, which suggests a possible fit with the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the use of semantic enhancement and the focus on user experience may also suggest a fit with cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.CY (Computers and Society), respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the utility of the tool for historical research, which may suggest a fit with cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
