The paper also uses a network utility maximization (NUM) formulation to solve the problem, which is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a new approach called Diff-Max, which separates routing and scheduling, and this approach involves making decisions jointly, which is a problem in the field of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also proposes two practical schemes, which involve optimization and machine learning techniques, respectively, which are topics in the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
