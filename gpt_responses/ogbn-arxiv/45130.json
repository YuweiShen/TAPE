Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Natural Gradient Stochastic Gradient Descent (NG-SGD) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) pretraining, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning (cs.DC). The paper also applies these techniques to speech recognition tasks, which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses multiple GPUs and Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallelization, which are topics related to parallel and distributed computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
