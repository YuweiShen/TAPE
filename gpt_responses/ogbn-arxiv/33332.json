Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses security issues related to the aerial network, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of Helikite platforms involves topics related to robotics and automation, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions the use of multimedia applications, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of powering the radio frequency equipment in the Helikite, which could involve topics related to energy efficiency and power management, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
