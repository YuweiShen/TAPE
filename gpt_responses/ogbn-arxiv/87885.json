This makes it likely to belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. The paper also applies the approach to safe trajectory following with specific application to quadrotor navigation, which suggests it could also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The use of neural networks for classification tasks indicates a possible fit with the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves optimization and decision-making, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks for classification tasks and the focus on approximate solutions suggest a possible fit with the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
