This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO), as well as programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses algorithmic details and formal claims, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
