The paper also introduces a new property called generalized deterministic submodularity, which is a concept that falls under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The paper proposes algorithms for solving the influence maximization problem, which involves optimization and approximation, and thus falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of influence maximization in a multiplex, which is a type of network that involves multiple layers, and thus falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
