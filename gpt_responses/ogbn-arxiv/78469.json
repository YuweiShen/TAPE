This topic falls under the intersection of several CS sub-categories, including information theory (cs.IT), cryptography and security (cs.CR), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). However, given the focus on optimizing the secrecy rate and injecting artificial noise, cs.IT and cs.CR are the most likely sub-categories. The use of multiple antennas and the consideration of resource-constrained devices also suggest cs.NI and cs.SY as possible sub-categories. Finally, the mention of RFID systems and low-power wireless systems may also relate to cs.MM, although this is less likely given the emphasis on security and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
