The use of the term \"secretary problem\" suggests a focus on online algorithms and decision-making under uncertainty, which are also common themes in CS research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). However, the paper also involves game theory (cs.GT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and information theory (cs.IT) concepts, which are relevant to the design and analysis of algorithms for submodular optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
