The paper specifically focuses on micro-expressions, which are a subset of facial expressions and require more fine-grained analysis, making it likely to also fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze facial expressions, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper uses a specific method for analyzing facial movements, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
