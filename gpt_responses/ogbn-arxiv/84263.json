The paper also discusses the use of smart mobility devices, which involves human-computer interaction.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions the use of air-quality measurements to inform citizens of zones of higher pollution, which involves the use of social and information networks.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of pedelecs or e-bikes, which are electric bikes, and the design of a cyber-physical system to mitigate the effect of urban pollution. This involves the use of robotics.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper briefly mentions the use of air-quality measurements to better inform citizens, which involves the retrieval of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
