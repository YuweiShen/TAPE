The paper also proposes a domain adaptive learning framework, which involves the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), indicating that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of hashing techniques, which could place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR) categories.
