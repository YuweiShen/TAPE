This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper describes the use of uPMUs for diagnostic and control applications in the electric grid at the distribution level. This involves computational techniques and engineering principles for analyzing and optimizing the performance of the grid.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper may involve the use of AI techniques for analyzing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the uPMUs, and for making decisions based on that data.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the communications infrastructure for the uPMU network, which involves networking and internet architecture principles.\n- cs.ETM (Emerging Technologies): The paper describes the use of uPMUs, which are a relatively new and emerging technology in the field of power distribution monitoring."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
