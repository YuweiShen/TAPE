The use of boolean and real matrix theory suggests a focus on algebraic and computational methods, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the usefulness of the obtained results, which could be related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
