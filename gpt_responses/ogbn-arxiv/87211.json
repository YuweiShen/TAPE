The use of rigorous polynomial and rational approximations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computer science and mathematics (cs.MS). Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of algorithms, which could place it in the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
