This involves learning a concise latent representation from multi-step reward prediction, which is then used for planning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel framework for learning a latent dynamics model, which involves training a neural network to predict rewards. This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to reinforcement learning that involves learning a latent state space for planning. This is a topic within the field of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in multi-pendulum and multi-cheetah environments, which are relevant to robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a model-based reinforcement learning framework, which involves learning a dynamics model and using it for planning. This is a topic within systems and control. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses multi-pendulum and multi-cheetah environments as testbeds, which involve visual observations. This falls under the scope of computer vision and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
