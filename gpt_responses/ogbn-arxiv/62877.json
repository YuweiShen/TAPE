This involves collecting two crowd scene datasets from Google using keyword searches and query-by-example image retrieval. The approach is evaluated on two challenging crowd counting datasets, indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Additionally, the use of learning-to-rank suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the use of imagery and datasets suggests a potential focus on multimedia (cs.MM) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
