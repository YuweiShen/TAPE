The paper proposes a new defense mechanism called EagleEye, which is designed to be attack-agnostic and effective against a wide range of adversarial attacks. This makes it likely that the paper would be classified under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer security (cs.CR), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and possibly also social and information networks (cs.SI) due to the potential impact of adversarial attacks on networked systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
