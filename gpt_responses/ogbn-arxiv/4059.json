The use of a secondary communication channel also involves considerations of security and cryptography, which are relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also discusses the practical implementation of the protocol coding strategies, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of error-control codes and comparisons with a naive strategy suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with signal processing and compression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
