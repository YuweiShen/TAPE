The proposed iterative procedure involves deriving sets of non-linear features, which is also a common technique in machine learning and data science (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of non-linear features in computer vision (cs.CV) and the likelihood of the models increasing with each iteration, which is a concept commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
