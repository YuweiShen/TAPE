The paper proposes a novel method called KGEval that uses coupling constraints to bind facts of a KG and crowdsources the facts that infer correctness of large parts of the KG. This problem is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for the use of machine learning techniques, computational linguistics (cs.CL) for the processing of natural language text, machine learning (cs.LG) for the optimization algorithm used in KGEval, information retrieval (cs.IR) for the use of web-scale text datasets, and databases (cs.DB) for the construction and management of knowledge graphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
