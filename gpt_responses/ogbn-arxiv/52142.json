This involves perception, planning, calibration, and gripping and suction systems, which are all related to robotics (cs.RO). The perception module uses a faster region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), which is a popular technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The system also incorporates a novel two finger gripper that uses pneumatic valve-based suction, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the system is designed to work in a warehouse environment, which involves control and automation (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
