The paper also involves the use of mathematical techniques to derive upper and lower bounds on the capacity, which could fall under signal processing (cs.SI) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper's focus on the multiplexing gain and scaling of capacity with channel dimensions could also relate to control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
