This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of normalization in iris recognition, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of segmentation, which is a common technique in computer security (cs.CR) for identifying and isolating specific regions of an image. Finally, the paper evaluates its system on three datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
