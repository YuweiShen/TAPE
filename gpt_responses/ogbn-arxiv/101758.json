The proposed network architecture and its adaptive resolution strategy involve the use of correlation layers, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses geometric matching, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper achieves state-of-the-art performance for optical flow, which is a classic problem in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
