The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The focus on micro- and macro-motion features suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The fact that the paper considers human perception of emotions suggests that it could belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of emotion datasets suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
