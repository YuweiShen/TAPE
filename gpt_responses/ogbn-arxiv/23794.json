The paper also uses the framework of multi-objective normal form games (MONFGs) to explore the differences between the two optimization criteria, which falls under the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the use of utility functions, which is relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the analysis of equilibria in multi-objective systems, which is relevant to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
