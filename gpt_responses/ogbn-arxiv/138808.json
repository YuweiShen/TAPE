This involves the use of linear precoders at the access points, and the analysis considers various factors such as intra-cluster pilot contamination, inter-cluster interference, and imperfect SIC. These aspects suggest that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Multimedia (cs.MM), or Communications (cs.COM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
