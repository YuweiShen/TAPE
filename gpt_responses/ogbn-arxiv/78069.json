This falls under the domain of social and information networks.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for inductive inference of new nodes based on their attributes, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a scalable graph embedding method, which involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for processing large-scale graphs.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with graph analysis tasks such as link prediction and recommendation, which are common problems in databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
