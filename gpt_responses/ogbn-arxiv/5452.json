This involves considering inter-feature dependencies to determine the salient predictors. This approach falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of false alarms on caregivers, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the use of physiological signals and sensors falls under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE) and the simulation results using a database falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
