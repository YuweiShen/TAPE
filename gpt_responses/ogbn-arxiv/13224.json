The proposed solution involves dynamic time warping (DTW) for automatic synchronization and a new feature extraction method called flow hashing (FH) based on frame averaging and optical flow descriptors. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), and information retrieval (cs.IR) research. Additionally, the paper addresses security concerns related to anti-piracy search (cs.CR) and proposes a fusion mechanism called distance boosting, which involves combining information extracted by DTW and FH, which could be considered a data fusion problem (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
