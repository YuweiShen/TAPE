Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The dataset includes multiple modalities, such as RGB, Depth, and IR, which suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a likely sub-category. Face anti-spoofing is a security-related task, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also proposes a new multi-modal fusion method, which involves ML techniques, indicating that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the dataset includes IR modality, which is related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
