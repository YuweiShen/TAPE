Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and transmission schemes, making this category a likely fit. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper deals with a communication system that uses multiple antennas and modulation techniques to improve performance. This is a key area of research in communications and networking, making this category a likely fit. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new system that combines multiple techniques to improve performance. This could be seen as a systems and control problem, making this category a possible fit. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a communication system that uses multiple antennas and modulation techniques to improve performance. This is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture, making this category a possible fit. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with a transmission scheme that uses modulation techniques to improve performance. This could be seen as a multimedia problem, making this category a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
