The most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), as the paper focuses on capacity-equivocation regions and information-theoretic bounds. The second likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), as the paper deals with secure communication in the presence of eavesdroppers. The third likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia), as the paper discusses the transmission of multiple messages over a shared channel.
