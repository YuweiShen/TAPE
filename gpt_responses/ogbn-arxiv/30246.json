This is a common problem in several domains, including signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Scientific Computing (cs.SC), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
