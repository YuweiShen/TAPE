The paper also employs supervisory control theory (SCT) for DES, which is a subfield of formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the decomposition of supervisors into local controllers, which is a topic in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also uses SCT to compute safety and liveness supervisors, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with distributed control, which is a topic in distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
