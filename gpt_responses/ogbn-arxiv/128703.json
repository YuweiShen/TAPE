The proposed model is applied to the image labeling problem, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The regularization during training using auxiliary sources of information suggests the use of semi-supervised learning (cs.LG). The use of graphical models to represent the relationship between noisy and clean labels suggests the use of probabilistic graphical models (cs.AI). The reduction of label noise in training suggests the use of error-correcting codes (cs.CR). Finally, the use of deep neural networks suggests the use of deep learning (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
