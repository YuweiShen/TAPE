The paper also discusses a queuing model for calculating waiting times, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The development of a shortest delay algorithm involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.DC). Finally, the use of cloud-based traffic control systems involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
