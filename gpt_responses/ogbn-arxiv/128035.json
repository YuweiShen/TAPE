Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the theoretical advantages of deep networks, which falls under the category of machine learning theory, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of numerical training methods, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep networks in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the difficulty of finding the mean square minimum of deep networks, which is a topic in optimization and numerical analysis, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
