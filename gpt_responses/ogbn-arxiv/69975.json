It also mentions complexity classes. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the internal definition of inductive datatypes in LFPL. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper uses a semantical framework to interpret constructs in different logics, which can be seen as a formal language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
