This problem is related to computational complexity, algorithms, and data structures (cs.CC, cs.DS), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also uses Schaefer's framework for classification of Boolean formulas, which is a topic in logic and computation (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
