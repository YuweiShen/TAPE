The use of gradient descent and analysis of regret bounds suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of multi-agent systems also suggests a possible fit for the systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper's focus on two-agent two-strategy zero-sum games aligns with the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
