The paper also mentions interval graphs, which are a well-studied topic in computational geometry, making cs.CG (Computational Geometry) a likely category as well. The paper's focus on graph modification problems and parameterized complexity suggests that it could also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
