Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces attention mechanism and multi-scale feature learning, which are common techniques in deep learning and machine learning. Therefore, the other likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
