This involves modeling the behavior of other agents and evaluating the action-values of each agent in a cooperative and decentralized way. The use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Decoupled-UCT suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also addresses the extension to continuous action spaces, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Finally, the problem of cooperative planning in traffic scenarios could be seen as a problem in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
