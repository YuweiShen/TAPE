The use of shuffling to simulate the Laplace mechanism involves randomness and probability, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a protocol for communication-efficient real summation, which is a topic in computer networks (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
