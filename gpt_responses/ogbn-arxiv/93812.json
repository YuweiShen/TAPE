The paper also investigates the asymptotic behavior of graph NNs, which is related to the convergence of dynamical systems, a topic that falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the topological information of the underlying graphs, which is a topic that falls under the category of Network Science (cs.SI). The paper also provides a principled guideline for weight normalization of graph NNs, which is a topic that falls under the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses experiments to confirm the proposed weight scaling, which is a topic that falls under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
