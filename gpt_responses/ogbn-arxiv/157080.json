The paper also involves a computer search, which suggests a possible connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of finite groups and their subgroups is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and group theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the potential use of non-abelian groups in network coding, which is a topic in systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
