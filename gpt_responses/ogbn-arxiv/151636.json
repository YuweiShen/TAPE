It uses neural network architectures to evaluate the contributions of bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down connections in forming perceptual groups. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and information processing systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
