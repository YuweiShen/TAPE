This involves analyzing the computational complexity of testing and learning such functions, which falls under the purview of computational complexity theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents algorithms for testing and learning linear $k$-juntas, which are fundamental concept classes in Boolean function analysis. This involves designing and analyzing data structures and algorithms for efficient computation. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper measures the closeness of a function to a linear $k$-junta with respect to the Gaussian measure on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This involves using concepts from information theory to quantify the amount of information shared between the function and the subspace it depends on. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with the problem of learning a function up to a rotation of the basis, which is a common problem in machine learning. Moreover, the class of linear $k$-juntas is a fundamental concept class in Boolean function analysis, which has applications in machine learning. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper shows that the class of intersections of $k$"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
