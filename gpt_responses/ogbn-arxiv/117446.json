It introduces formal semantics and discusses the complexity of determining if a permission is implied by a set of licenses. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): XrML is used in industry for writing software licenses, which is a security-related topic. The paper discusses the correctness of the algorithm for determining if a permission follows from a set of licenses. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper introduces formal semantics for XrML and discusses the complexity of determining if a permission is implied by a set of licenses, which are topics related to logic. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses a language used in industry for writing software licenses and proposes corrections to the algorithm for determining if a permission follows from a set of licenses. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the complexity of determining if a permission is implied by a set of XrML licenses and proves that the general problem is undecidable but polynomial-time computable for an expressive fragment of the language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
