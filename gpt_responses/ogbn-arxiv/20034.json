This involves optimizing the packet rates to be requested from parent nodes to minimize decoding delay for all clients. The paper also discusses the use of convex subproblems to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also touches upon distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY) in terms of the proposed algorithm's effectiveness in reducing bottlenecks and improving performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
