The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Layca, which is designed to control the rotation rate of each layer's weight vector during training. This is a novel approach that has not been explored extensively in previous work, and it has the potential to significantly improve the generalization ability of deep models. Given the focus on deep learning optimization and generalization, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
