The use of the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The development of novel approximation algorithms using graph optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
