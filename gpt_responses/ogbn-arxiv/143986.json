This falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also focuses on objective functions from computer vision and machine learning, which suggests that it could be relevant to sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper compares different tools and methods for computing derivatives, which could be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
