The proposed scheme involves feedback of quantized bits, which is a communication aspect and falls under networked systems (cs.NI). The joint sparsity structure and compressed sensing algorithm used in the scheme are also related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on FDD systems, which is a subfield of wireless communication and falls under mobile computing and networking (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
