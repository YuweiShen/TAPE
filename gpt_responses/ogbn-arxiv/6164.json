The paper also considers both non-indecomposable and indecomposable channels, which are topics in network information theory (cs.NI). The concept of stochastically degraded channels is also relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper may also be relevant to communication complexity (cs.CC) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to its focus on broadcast channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
