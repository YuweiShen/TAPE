This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of FPGAs for implementation, which could fall under the embedded systems (cs.EM) sub-category. The paper also involves the optimization of resource usage, which could fall under the optimization and control (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of algorithms for decoding, which could fall under the algorithms (cs.AR) sub-category.
