The use of machine learning models to predict affective responses also suggests a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The focus on understanding user interactions with recommendation systems and social machines could place this paper in the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of transfer learning and pre-training on a large dataset could also suggest a fit for the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning models and the focus on improving performance could place this paper in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
