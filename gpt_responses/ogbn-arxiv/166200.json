This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of power-efficient RF amplifiers, which could fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of large antenna arrays, which could fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
