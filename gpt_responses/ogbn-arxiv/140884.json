The proposed method involves clustering and generating new data samples for minority class samples based on the distance between the sample and its respective cluster centroid. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data mining (cs.DM), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
