The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for processing raw image observations. The proposed approach involves learning the controller and its conditioning in an end-to-end manner, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also deals with system-level issues such as deployability and planning horizon, which are relevant to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
