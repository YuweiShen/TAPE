The algorithms are based on optimizing the likelihood function of the community assignments given a graph and an estimate of the statistical model that generated it. This is a machine learning problem and hence, it is likely to belong to this category.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The problem of community detection on networks is a classic problem in social and information networks. The paper proposes algorithms to solve this problem and hence, it is likely to belong to this category.\n3. cs.SD (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a constrained semi-definite programming algorithm for community detection on networks. This is a problem in systems and control and hence, it is likely to belong to this category.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms for community detection on networks. This is a problem in data structures and algorithms and hence, it is likely to belong to this category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes machine learning algorithms for community detection on networks.
