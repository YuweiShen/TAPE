The paper discusses two pragmatic modeling methods for text generation and evaluates their performance on abstractive summarization and generation from structured meaning representations. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, since the paper uses machine learning techniques, it is also likely to belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses improving the performance of existing systems, which suggests it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
