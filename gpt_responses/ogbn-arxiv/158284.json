This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning techniques also makes it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the focus on hardware limitations and timing/computation constraints makes it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
