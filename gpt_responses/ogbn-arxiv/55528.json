Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.DB (Databases) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes improvements using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which makes cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the properties of queries and the need for generalization, which are relevant to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, making cs.LG (Learning) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) in the context of evaluating text-to-SQL systems, which makes cs.IR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
