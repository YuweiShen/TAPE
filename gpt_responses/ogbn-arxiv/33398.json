The focus on programming languages and frameworks suggests cs.PL (Programming Languages) as the most likely category. The mention of multi-threading and parallelism suggests cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as likely categories. The use of the term \"development support\" suggests cs.SE (Software Engineering) as a possible category.
