This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to distributed and parallel computing, which falls under the cs.DC sub-category.\n\n2. cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the need to optimize workflow execution time and resource footprint while satisfying resource constraints imposed by individual algorithms. This suggests that the paper may be related to database management, which falls under the cs.DB sub-category.\n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the scheduling and partitioning of graphs, which involves optimizing the execution of algorithmic components. This suggests that the paper may be related to data structures and algorithms, which falls under the cs.DS sub-category.\n\n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper mentions the need to solve large-scale inverse problems within the power budget, which suggests that the paper may be related to numerical analysis, which falls under the cs.NA sub-category.\n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of the Data Activated Liu Graph Engine (DALiuGE) to manage data processing pipelines for several"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
