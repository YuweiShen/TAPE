The proposed SPIKE mission concept also involves a small-satellite bus with an extendable boom and force-moment sensors, which falls under the domain of robotics.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The SPIKE mission concept involves controlling the movement and stability of a small spacecraft on stilts, which requires expertise in systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions the use of AI for autonomous navigation and decision-making during asteroid missions, which falls under the domain of AI.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The development of software for controlling the spacecraft and analyzing the data collected during the mission is an important aspect of asteroid missions, which falls under the domain of software engineering.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This is an unlikely category, but the paper mentions seismology as one of the scientific operations that can be performed on an asteroid using the SPIKE mission concept. Seismology involves the study of sound waves, which falls under the domain of sound."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
