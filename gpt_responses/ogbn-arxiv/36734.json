The use of interference alignment is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI) and the paper specifically mentions it as the basis for achievability. The paper also discusses the use of zero forcing, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper deals with MIMO systems, which is a topic in both signal processing and communication engineering (cs.MM, cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
