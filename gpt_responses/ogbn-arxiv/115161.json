The use of tableau method and integer linear feasibility checking suggests that this paper may also belong to the subfield of logic and verification (cs.LO). The description logic SHOQ is commonly used in ontology engineering and database modeling, which suggests that this paper may also belong to the subfield of databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the use of caching and optimization techniques may suggest that this paper may also belong to the subfield of natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL) or the subfield of computational complexity and algorithms (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
