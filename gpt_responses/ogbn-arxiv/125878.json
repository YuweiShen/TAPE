The use of decomposition method and Gray map also suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and group theory (cs.GT). The paper also involves the investigation of generators and idempotent generators of codes, which is a topic related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of skew cyclic codes over a finite ring can also be considered as a subfield of algebraic coding theory (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the properties of principally generated codes, which is a topic related to cyclic codes and their generalizations (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
