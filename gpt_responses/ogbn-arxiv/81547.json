It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it uses a state-of-the-art neural model for NER. Additionally, the use of eye-tracking data could place it in the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on gaze features and their impact on NER models could also make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
