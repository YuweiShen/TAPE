The paper uses tools from information theory, communication theory, and signal processing to study the problem. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with communication systems, so cs.COMM (Communications) is another likely sub-category. The paper also uses tools from signal processing, so cs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible sub-category. The paper also deals with the scaling of frame synchronization error with the frame length and the channel parameters, so cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
