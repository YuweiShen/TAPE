The paper also explores the impact of media access control (MAC) layer on the algorithm's performance, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed solution for resolving the issues with MAC interference involves modifying the algorithm's behavior, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
