The paper proposes a novel algorithm for solving this problem, which is based on multi-armed bandit online learning techniques (cs.LG). The algorithm is designed to address practical concerns such as switching costs and convergence time, which are important considerations in the field of control systems (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithm in terms of fairness among devices, which is a topic of interest in the field of cryptography (cs.CR). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI, cs.LG, cs.SY, cs.IT, and cs.CR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
