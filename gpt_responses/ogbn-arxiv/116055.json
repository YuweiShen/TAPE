This involves analyzing current practices of domain experts, deriving design requirements, and conducting in-depth case studies. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) as the system involves exploring and partitioning parameter spaces. Graphics (cs.GR) is also a likely sub-category as the system involves visualization. Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) are also possible sub-categories as the system involves developing and testing simulation models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
