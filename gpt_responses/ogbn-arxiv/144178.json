The proposed architecture explicitly models task interactions at multiple scales, which is a common technique in CV and image processing. The paper also discusses the use of feature propagation and aggregation, which are common techniques in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (computer vision) and cs.LG (machine learning), followed by cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.CL (computational linguistics), and cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
