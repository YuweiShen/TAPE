The paper also discusses energy efficiency, which falls under the category of optimization and control (OH). The paper's focus on the scenario with more transmit than receive antennas suggests that it may also fall under the category of systems and control (SY). Finally, the paper deals with optical channels, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of photonics (PH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
