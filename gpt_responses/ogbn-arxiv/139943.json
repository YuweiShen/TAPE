The paper also mentions compression, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) and database systems (cs.DB). The use of sequential scans and lower bounds on complexity suggest a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
