Specifically, the paper focuses on using the smatch scoring script and neural translation models to improve accuracy. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of rule-based classifiers and ensemble methods, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of character-level neural translation, which is a sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves the evaluation of parsing accuracy, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
