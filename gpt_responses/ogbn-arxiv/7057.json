This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed solution uses deep learning and fusion layers to accurately classify driver behaviors. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a solution that uses deep learning to recognize driver behaviors, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to reduce the incidence of car accidents rooted in cognitive distraction, which is a human factor. Therefore, cs.HC is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses multi-stream inputs, i.e., in-vehicle cameras with different fields of view and optical flows computed based on recorded images, to recognize driver behaviors. This falls under the domain of multimedia, making cs.MM a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
