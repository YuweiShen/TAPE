The paper proposes new conditions for ensuring the termination of a breadth-first forward chaining algorithm known as the chase, which is a common technique used in knowledge representation and reasoning. This topic is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), databases (cs.DB), logic (cs.LO), deep learning (cs.DL), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given the focus on ontological knowledge representation and reasoning, cs.AI and cs.DB are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
