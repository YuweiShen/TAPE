The paper proposes a logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem, which is a significant contribution to the field of active learning and ranking. The paper also presents some preliminary experimental results based on the proposed algorithm. Given the focus of the paper on machine learning and information retrieval, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
