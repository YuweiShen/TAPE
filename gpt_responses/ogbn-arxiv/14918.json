The use of Deep ConvNets and ResNet architecture also suggests that it could be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the potential applications of action recognition in video surveillance and human-computer interaction suggest that it could also be categorized under Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of recurrent connections in the proposed architecture suggests that it could also be categorized under Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
