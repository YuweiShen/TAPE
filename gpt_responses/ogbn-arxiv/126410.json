The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification datasets, which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). The use of evolutionary algorithms for network architecture search is a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential application of the proposed method in dynamic systems, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
