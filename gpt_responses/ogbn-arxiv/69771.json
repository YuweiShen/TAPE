Machine learning techniques are used to evaluate the effectiveness of different policies. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper applies the proposed framework to the design of university admission policies, which can be seen as a problem in computational engineering. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a causal model as a framework for describing different families of policies and compares them theoretically and experimentally. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions legal requirements for affirmative action policies, which may involve issues related to privacy and security. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of increasing the representation of disadvantaged socio-demographic groups, which is a social issue that can be studied using network analysis techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
