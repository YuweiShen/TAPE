The use of word embeddings and retrofitting methods suggests that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes deep extrofitting, which involves stacking multiple layers of retrofitting and extrofitting, indicating that this paper may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of unsupervised methods, suggesting that it may be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed methods on word similarity tasks, which is a common evaluation metric in information retrieval (IR), indicating that it may be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Lastly, the paper discusses the effect of word vector enrichment on text classification, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
