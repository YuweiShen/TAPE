The paper also discusses the algorithmic problem of tensor isomorphism, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). The use of heuristics and theoretical algorithms suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
