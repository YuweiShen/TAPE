Additionally, the framework developed in the paper could be seen as a form of machine learning for identifying different regimes in dynamical systems. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper does not explicitly mention neural or evolutionary computing, but the framework developed in the paper could potentially be applied in these areas. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The framework developed in the paper could be seen as a form of artificial intelligence for identifying different regimes in dynamical systems.
