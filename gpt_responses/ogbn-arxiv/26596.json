Additionally, the paper discusses the use of compressive measurements in MDC, which could also place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Signal Processing (cs.SI) categories. The paper also mentions the use of CS in resource-constrained scenarios like sensor networks, which could place it in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. Finally, the paper includes simulations to assess the performance of the proposed method, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
