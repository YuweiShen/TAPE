The paper discusses radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting, improper Gaussian signaling, and full-duplex communication mode. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communication (cs.COM).
