Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a growing CNN model that adapts to the huge diversity seen in crowd scenes, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. The proposed model achieves higher count accuracy on major crowd datasets, which involves performance evaluation and analysis. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
