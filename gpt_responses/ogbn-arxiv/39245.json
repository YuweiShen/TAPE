The paper also discusses the definition of local optima in nonconvex-nonconcave formulations, which falls under the sub-category of cs.GT (Game Theory). Additionally, the paper proposes a mathematical definition of local minimax and establishes a connection to a local search algorithm, which are topics covered in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.GT, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
