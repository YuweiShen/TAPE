The paper also discusses parameter efficiency, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper modifies the Squeeze and Excitation variant of attention, which is a type of neural network architecture commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses translation equivariance, which is a topic in neural networks and computational neuroscience (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the models on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, which are common datasets used in natural language processing and computer vision (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
