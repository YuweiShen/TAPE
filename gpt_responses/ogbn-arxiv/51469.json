It also involves natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as entity recognition and caption generation, which suggests it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The use of deep learning models for vision and language tasks indicates that it could be classified under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
