Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses different methods for combining the ELMo embeddings, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of ELMo embeddings in image captioning, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the training speed-up achieved by reducing the complexity of the language model, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
