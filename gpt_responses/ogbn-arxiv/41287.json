It proposes a coding scheme based on nested lattices to achieve perfect or strong secrecy, and derives achievable rates for reliable and secure computation in the presence of Gaussian noise. This work is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), cryptography (cs.CR), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), security and privacy (cs.SI), and multimedia (cs.MM) due to its focus on secure communication in a wireless network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
