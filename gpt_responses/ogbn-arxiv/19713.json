This makes categories such as cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.ET (Embedded Systems) likely candidates. The paper also mentions algorithmic optimizations such as quantization, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
