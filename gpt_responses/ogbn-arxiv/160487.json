Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also proposes two innovative MAC protocols, which falls under the category of cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed strategies in a laboratory experimental testbed, which is related to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
