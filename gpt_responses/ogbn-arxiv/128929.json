This falls under the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.LG and cs.AI. The paper also deals with image classification, which is covered by the sub-category cs.CV. The paper uses attention mechanisms, which are covered by the sub-category cs.CL.
