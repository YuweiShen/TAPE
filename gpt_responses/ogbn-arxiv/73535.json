The methodology proposed involves the representation and calculation of generalized forces, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The use of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) as actuators is a topic in electrical engineering (cs.ET) and materials science (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
