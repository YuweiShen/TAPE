The paper also presents a constructive approach to express the resultant as the exact determinant of a Koszul resultant matrix, which involves symbolic computations. \n- cs.AG (Algebraic Geometry): The paper deals with the computation of the resultant of bilinear systems involving two different supports, which is a problem in algebraic geometry. The paper also presents a constructive approach to express the resultant as the exact determinant of a Koszul resultant matrix, which is a tool used in algebraic geometry. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes an algorithm to solve bilinear systems with two supports using the Koszul resultant matrix. The algorithm involves numerical computations and matrix operations. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithm to solve bilinear systems with two supports using the Koszul resultant matrix. The algorithm involves data structures and algorithms for matrix operations. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper extends the classical eigenvalues and eigenvectors criterion to a more general setting, which applies to a general class of matrices, including the Sylvester-type and the Koszul-type ones. This is a topic related to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
