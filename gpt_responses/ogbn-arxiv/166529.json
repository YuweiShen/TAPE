The proposed method involves learning the boundary as an additional semantic class and using unidirectional acyclic graphs (UAGs) to model the function of undirected cyclic graphs (UCGs), which suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper proposes a boundary-aware feature propagation (BFP) module, which involves harvesting and propagating local features within their regions isolated by the learned boundaries, indicating that the paper may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-categories. Finally, the paper achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three challenging semantic segmentation datasets, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
