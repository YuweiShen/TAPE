This involves techniques from computer vision (cs.CV) such as object detection and segmentation, as well as machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) for modeling the normal behavior of objects in videos. The paper also evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets (cs.MM) and uses graphical models for inference (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
