The method involves matching the moment of the posterior distribution of the neural network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Caltech-UCSD-Birds, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses transfer learning techniques such as weight transfer and L2-norm, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
