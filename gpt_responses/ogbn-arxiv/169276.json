It may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves virtual try-on and generation of person images. Additionally, it may fall under multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with image and video processing. The use of a multi-stage framework and end-to-end training suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the proposed Tree-Block for harnessing multi-scale features indicates that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
