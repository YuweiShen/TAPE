This involves solving a learning problem of sample generation via minimizing an effective meta-classification loss in a single-stage network. The paper also proposes an organized auxiliary task co-training over known categories to stabilize the meta-training process. Given these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
