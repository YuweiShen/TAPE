The proposed improvements involve reducing computational complexity, which is a common concern in the systems and control (cs.SI) community. The paper also discusses a re-selection scheme, which involves identifying periodic points and changing reliability information, which are topics commonly studied in the dynamical systems (cs.DS) community.
