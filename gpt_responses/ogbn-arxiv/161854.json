The proposed method involves the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a popular machine learning technique (cs.LG). The use of 3D convolutional features is also mentioned, which relates to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also involves the development of an end-to-end deep network, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves experiments and evaluation of performance, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
