Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication and information processing. The paper also involves network optimization and system-level analysis, which suggests the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of circular antenna arrays and the analysis of the impact of antenna location suggest the category cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with signal processing and multimedia communication. Finally, the paper involves simulations and numerical results, which suggest the category cs.COM (Computers and Society), which deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
