This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. Additionally, the paper involves trade-offs between memory/communication complexity and sample complexity, which are common themes in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions using standard distributions and studying a practical estimation problem, which could indicate a focus on Statistical Learning (cs.SI) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
