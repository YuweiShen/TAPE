The paper's focus on characterizing the optimal rate of an LR code and developing tight bounds on the sub-packetization level of RG codes suggests that it belongs to the information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. The paper's contributions to the theory of LR and RG codes also make it relevant to the distributed systems (cs.DS) and coding theory (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on constructing low field size Maximal Recoverable codes suggests that it may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
