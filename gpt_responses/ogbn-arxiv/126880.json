Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a novel model compression technique and architecture-aware compiler optimizations, which could also be relevant to the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and embedded systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper mentions the use of real-time performance, which could be relevant to the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
