Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the performance analysis of the proposed detectors, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.COMM (Communications) and cs.SP (Signal Processing). The use of soft metrics in the ML detector also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
