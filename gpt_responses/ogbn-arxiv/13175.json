This problem is related to signal processing (cs.SP) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also presents a recovery method based on convex programming, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and the paper also presents a measure-theoretic formulation of the recovery problem, which falls under the category of statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
