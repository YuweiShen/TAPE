This suggests a strong connection to computer vision. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes and evaluates several models for cross-lingual verb sense disambiguation, which involves machine learning techniques. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper addresses a challenging task that requires AI techniques, such as natural language understanding and multimodal integration. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a multimodal dataset of images and verbs, and shows that combining visual and textual information improves machine translation. This suggests a connection to multimedia research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
