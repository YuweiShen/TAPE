Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the hardware characteristics of the system, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
