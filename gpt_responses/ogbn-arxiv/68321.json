This involves combining different non-coherent metrics that exploit the transient features of the signals. The paper also discusses the theoretical bit error rate (BER) for any constructed high-dimensional non-coherent metric and designs a generalised blind detection algorithm that utilizes the Parzen approximation and its probabilistic neural network (Parzen-PNN) to detect information bits. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
