The paper discusses the relations between realizable and non-realizable cases of the problem, and characterizes the cases when a solution exists and finding these solutions. The paper also shows that the framework is completely general and not restricted to any specific type of process measures. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
