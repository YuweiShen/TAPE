Therefore, it is likely to belong to the database (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of FedX, a highly optimized federation mediator for Linked Data, which falls under the category of deep learning (cs.DL) and semantic web (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of a hybrid setting, which involves managing data across different networks, indicating a potential overlap with the cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
