The proposed approach also involves mathematical analysis and inference, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of vector space approach for conceptual spaces is also related to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the proposed algorithm for conceptual scaling can be related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
