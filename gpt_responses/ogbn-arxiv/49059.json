The paper specifically focuses on learning to generate decisions for optimization problems with hidden constraints, which suggests that it may fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions using an interior point method, which is a common optimization technique, indicating that it may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) and computational engineering (cs.CE) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
