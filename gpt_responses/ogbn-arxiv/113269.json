This involves combining a public transit network and a transfer graph representing a secondary transportation mode, such as walking or taxis. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing algorithms and proposes a new algorithm family called ULTRA-Query, which integrates the transfer shortcuts computed by the ULTRA preprocessing technique. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (artificial intelligence) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), as the paper involves developing new algorithms and techniques for optimizing multi-modal route planning. Other likely sub-categories include cs.RO (robotics), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.SI (social and information networks), as the paper also involves analyzing and optimizing complex networks and systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
