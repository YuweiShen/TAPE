This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as word embeddings and locality modules, which are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), computational linguistics (CL), and machine learning (LG). The paper also evaluates the proposed methods using datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, which is related to information retrieval (IR) and databases (DB). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.LG, followed by cs.IR and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
