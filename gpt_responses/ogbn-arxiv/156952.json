This makes cs.DS a very likely category.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The Feedback Vertex Set problem is a well-known problem in discrete mathematics, and the paper presents a theoretical analysis of an algorithm for this problem. This makes cs.DM a likely category as well.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the time complexity of an algorithm for the Feedback Vertex Set problem, which is a classic NP-hard problem. This makes cs.CC a likely category.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The Feedback Vertex Set problem is also relevant in game theory, as it can be used to model certain types of games. This makes cs.GT a possible category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Feedback Vertex Set problem is also relevant in artificial intelligence, as it can be used to model certain types of reasoning and decision-making problems.
