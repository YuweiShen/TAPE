The use of 3D spatial channel model suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed methods involve optimization and performance evaluation, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
