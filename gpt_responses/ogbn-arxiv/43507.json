It also proposes the use of policies and processes, aligning systems with forensics objectives, and training employees, which are related to software engineering (cs.SE). The integration of requirements for forensics into relevant phases of the systems development lifecycle is also discussed, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also touches on the importance of considering requirements for forensics in the context of cybercrime investigations (cs.CY) and the challenges of engineering forensic-ready systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
