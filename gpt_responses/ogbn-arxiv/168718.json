The paper focuses on the development of a new method for learning node representations in directed graphs, which is a core problem in the field of machine learning. The paper proposes a new approach that maintains separate views or embedding spaces for the two distinct node roles induced by the directionality of the edges. This approach is based on an alternating random walk strategy to generate training samples from the directed graph while preserving the role information. The paper also proposes a clear strategy for evaluating link prediction and graph reconstruction in directed graphs. These characteristics suggest that the paper is most likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
