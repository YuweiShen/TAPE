The paper specifically studies the geometric structure of the non-convex objective function in ReLU networks, which is a common type of neural network architecture. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary sub-category for papers on neural networks and deep learning. \n\nThe paper also touches on topics related to optimization and computational complexity, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper's focus on image classification and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's theoretical approach and analysis of the geometric structure of the objective function could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
