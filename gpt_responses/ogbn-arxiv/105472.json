The use of Fourier expansion and multilinear polynomials suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and algebraic data structures (cs.DS). The mention of testing Booleanity and lower bounds suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
