The proposed Soft Sampling method involves re-weighting gradients, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of missing annotations on the training signal, which is related to the field of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the experiments involve training neural networks, which is a common technique in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
