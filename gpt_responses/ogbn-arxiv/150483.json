The paper proposes a new framework for non-monotonic streams and introduces a new stream parameter, the \"variability\", which is a measure of how quickly the stream varies. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.IT (Information Theory), which are both relevant sub-categories for data streams. \n\nThe paper also discusses worst-case communication bounds and the space requirements for summarizing a distributed non-monotonic stream, which are topics in machine learning and statistics. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the proposed framework and provides examples of input classes where the variability is small. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which is a relevant sub-category for studying real-world data streams."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
