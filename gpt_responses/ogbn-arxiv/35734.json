The focus is on improving the transparency of interaction, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of a state-dependent impedance controller also involves mathematical optimization (cs.MA) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
