This involves the use of techniques such as convolutional neural networks and long short term memory, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also focuses on the robustness of these classifiers against attacks, which is a key concern in the field of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the use of adversarial attacks involves the manipulation of neural networks, which is a topic of interest in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the limitations of current machine learning-based modulation classifiers, which is a topic of interest in the field of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques to classify modulations, which is a topic of interest in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
