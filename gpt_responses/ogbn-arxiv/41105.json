The use of automata and formal language theory indicates that it may also belong to the categories of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper's focus on decision procedures and algorithms suggests that it may also belong to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
