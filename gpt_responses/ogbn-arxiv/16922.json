The use of synchronous rounds and communication constraints also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). The algorithms designed in the paper involve decision-making and label manipulation, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
