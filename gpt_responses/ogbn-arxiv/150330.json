The paper also discusses sublinear amortized update time, which is a common topic in data structures (cs.DS). The use of cuttings is a common technique in discrete and computational geometry (cs.DM). The paper also mentions the Hausdorff distance, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses improvements in dynamic data structures, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
