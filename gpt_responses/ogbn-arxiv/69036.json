It also involves the use of statistical classifiers, which are commonly used in natural language processing. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) due to the use of active learning strategies and the comparison of different selection methods. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) may also be relevant as the task of mention detection is related to information extraction. Finally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) may be relevant as the paper may involve the use of neural networks or evolutionary algorithms in the classifiers used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
