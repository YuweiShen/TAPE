Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The use of word embeddings also suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category.
