The paper also discusses using pre-trained models and transfer learning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of labeled data to train the model, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) as well as multimedia (cs.MM) since camera trap images are a form of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
