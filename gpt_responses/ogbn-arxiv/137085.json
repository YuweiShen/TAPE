The paper also discusses the incorporation of innate immunity into these models, which involves the use of systems and control theory (cs.SY) to model the complex interactions between immune cells. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) to develop these models. Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of these models in robotics (cs.RO) and other fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
