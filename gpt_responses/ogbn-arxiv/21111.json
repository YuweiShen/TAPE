This involves the acquisition of local, TX-dependent, estimates of the global multi-user channel state matrix obtained via terminal feedback and limited backhauling. This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) scheme that is robust to the distributed aspect of the CSI, which involves optimization of a TX-dependent power level and regularization factor. This falls under the domain of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with cooperative broadcast channels, which falls under the domain of communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
