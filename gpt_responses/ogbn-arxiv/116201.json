The paper also presents an algorithm for solving temporal constraints, which falls under the category of computational logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions Datalog, which is a database query language (cs.DB) and discusses the inexpressibility of the language, which is related to computational complexity (cs.DS).
