However, the focus on channel state information (CSI) acquisition and the use of random matrix theory to derive deterministic equivalents suggest that the paper is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Other possible sub-categories include Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Machine Learning (cs.MM), and Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
