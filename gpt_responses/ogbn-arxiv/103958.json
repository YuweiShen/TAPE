Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on natural language processing and its interaction with computation. The paper also proposes a novel word pairing strategy to automatically identify and propagate the precise fine-grained word alignment from lexical definitions, which involves machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method in word-level and sentence-level translation tasks, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and deep learning (cs.DL), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
