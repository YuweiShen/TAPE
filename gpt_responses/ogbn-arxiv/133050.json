The use of optimal transport programming to learn an importance-driven distance metric is a machine learning technique, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The empirical results on visual retrieval and classification tasks with six benchmark datasets suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
