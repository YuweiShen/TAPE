The paper proposes a framework for learning a vector per class in the same embedding space as the word and paragraph embeddings, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The similarity between class vectors and word vectors is used as features for classification, which is also a common task in Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computer Vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.IR, cs.AI, and cs.CV, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
