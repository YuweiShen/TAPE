The paper proposes a method that involves eliciting expert knowledge about pairwise feature similarities to improve predictive performance. This method is based on sequential decision making techniques to minimize the effort of the expert. Given the focus on machine learning and statistics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
