The proposed mechanism involves a convex optimization program and a fractional local search algorithm, which are both topics in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses approximation ratios, which is a common topic in theoretical computer science and machine learning (cs.LG).
