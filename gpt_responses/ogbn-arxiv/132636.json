The paper also presents optimization algorithms for solving the associated problems, which falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and optimization (cs.GR). Additionally, the use of proximal operators suggests a connection to convex optimization and regularization, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
