The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper focuses on deep reinforcement learning, a subfield of AI. The paper also discusses multiagent learning, which falls under the sub-category cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). Additionally, the paper discusses practical challenges and computational demands, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper provides general guidelines for new practitioners, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
