The paper specifically focuses on multi-server coded caching, which involves collaboration among servers, making it relevant to the distributed computing (cs.DC) and system architecture (cs.SI) communities. The paper also proposes a new method for improving transmission rates, which is related to coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
