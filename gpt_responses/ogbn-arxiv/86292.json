This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as well as theoretical computer science (cs.DS, cs.IT, cs.AI, cs.GT). The paper provides algorithms with nearly-optimal sample complexities, which suggests a theoretical focus and thus the likelihood of cs.DS, cs.IT, and cs.GT. However, the problem also involves stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, which suggests a machine learning focus and thus the likelihood of cs.LG and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
