This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes an IRS-aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users. This involves networking and internet architecture concepts such as wireless communication, access points, etc.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimizing the transmit power at the access point by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers.
