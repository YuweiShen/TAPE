This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses multiuser detection and channel equalization systems, which are related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents closed-form expressions for optimum allocations and system performance, which can be considered as a system-level optimization problem falling under the domain of control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
