The paper also presents deterministic matrix constructions based on Kronecker products, which are often used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the flipping algorithm proposed in the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
