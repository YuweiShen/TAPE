It also involves the use of decimation, which is a technique commonly used in network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the performance of the decoder in terms of error floor, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides numerical results for column-weight three codes, which is a topic in communication complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
