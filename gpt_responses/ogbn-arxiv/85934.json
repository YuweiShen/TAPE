This topic falls under the category of Computer Networks and Communications (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a new routing metric that takes into account inter-flow interference, which is related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Optimization and Control (cs.MA). The use of UAVs for network infrastructure also involves Robotics (cs.RO) and System and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
