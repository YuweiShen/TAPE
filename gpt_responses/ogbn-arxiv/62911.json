The paper specifically addresses the challenge of normalizing phonetic typing variations in code-mixed data, which is a sub-topic within NLP. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also utilizes a Seq2Seq model, which is a popular deep learning architecture for NLP tasks. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on normalizing and back-transliterating words in code-mixed data may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as these tasks are important for improving the accuracy of search and retrieval systems that operate on code-mixed data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
