The use of iterative decoding also suggests a possible connection to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The comparison with multiplexed parallel turbo codes suggests a possible connection to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the practical applications of LDPC codes in communication systems suggest a possible connection to computer networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
