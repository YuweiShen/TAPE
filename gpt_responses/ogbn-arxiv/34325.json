The use of compressive sensing also involves signal processing (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The proposed model for object detection and localization is based on deep learning, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
