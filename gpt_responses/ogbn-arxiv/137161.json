The use of regular languages and finite automata also suggests a connection to automata theory and formal languages (cs.FL). The paper also mentions the complexity of the model checking procedures, which could be related to algorithms and complexity theory (cs.DS). Additionally, the use of rational transducers and regular sets of states suggests a connection to artificial intelligence and natural language processing (cs.AI) as well as programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
