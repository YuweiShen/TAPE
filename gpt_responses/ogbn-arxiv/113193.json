This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of inequality constraints to tolerate uncertainties, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of regression networks is also related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the application of the proposed strategy is evaluated on magnetic resonance images (MRI), which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
