This task involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which are commonly studied in the computer science sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), social and information networks (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
