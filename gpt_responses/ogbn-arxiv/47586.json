Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses training techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of ratios of negatives to positives and mini-batch training could also suggest that it belongs to cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the use of pre-trained object detectors and the focus on appearance and layout encodings could suggest that it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
