The proposed framework involves the use of a CNN for extracting text instance contour information, which is a task that involves machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of multi-task learning, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The extracted contour information is used to improve scene text detection, which is a task related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
