The use of multi-output regression and the focus on semantic ambiguities and class overlaps suggest a machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) perspective. The use of egocentric datasets suggests a potential focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
