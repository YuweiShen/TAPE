The proposed feature sets are estimated from video, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses continuous learning and prediction experiments, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG). The use of speech feature sets suggests that natural language processing (cs.CL) may also be relevant. Finally, the paper mentions the RECOLA dataset, which is a multimodal dataset that includes audio, video, and physiological signals, indicating that multimedia computing (cs.MM) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
