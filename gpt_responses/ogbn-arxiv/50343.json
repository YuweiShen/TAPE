The focus on cliques and separators suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as likely categories. The use of graph algorithms and complexity analysis suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the mention of real-world applications suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
