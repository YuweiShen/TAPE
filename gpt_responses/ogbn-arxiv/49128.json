This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the ergodic data rate and coverage probability for the proposed 3D cellular model, which involves the use of stochastic geometry and frequency allocation scheme. This falls under the domain of information theory.\n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper proposes a tractable model for aerial base stations' deployment based on binomial Delaunay-tetrahedralization, which ensures seamless coverage for a given space. This falls under the domain of game theory, as it involves the optimization of resources for maximum coverage.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a novel 3D cellular model for aerial base stations and user equipments, which involves the use of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission technique and frequency allocation scheme.
