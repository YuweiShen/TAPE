The paper uses techniques from data structures (such as LZ77 parsing), information theory (such as compression), computational complexity (such as rounds of communication), and communication complexity (such as total communication). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
