The paper provides positive and negative results for the problem, including an FPT algorithm, a kernelization result, and lower bounds on the degrees of the polynomials. These results are likely to be of interest to researchers in several areas of computer science, including discrete mathematics (cs.DM), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), graph theory (cs.GT), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
