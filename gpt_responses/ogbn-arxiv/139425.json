This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to processing CNNs that is designed to reduce memory requirements, which could also place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on embedded applications suggests that it may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
