It proposes an alternative approach called Pareto-Efficient Fairness (PEF) and evaluates its performance on several UCI datasets. Given the focus on machine learning and fairness, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
