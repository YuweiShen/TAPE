The use of sensors also involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for processing the sensor data. The tracking problem is formulated as a filtering problem, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a low complexity filter, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) for approximating the joint sensor-feature state density. Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques (cs.AI) for minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
