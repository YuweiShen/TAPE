It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as the approach for action localization builds upon the current state-of-the-art methods. The use of movies to gather a varied set of action representations suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The need for developing new approaches for video understanding indicates that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the precise spatio-temporal annotations and exhaustive annotation of atomic actions suggest that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
