Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the high-capacity neural parametrizations and optimization techniques, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on two tasks, one of which is machine translation, which falls under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
