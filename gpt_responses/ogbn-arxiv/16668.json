The paper also introduces novel methods that incorporate active learning, which is a machine learning concept (cs.LG). The use of deep learning in error decoding also falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper deals with improving the decoding of communication blocks, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category.
