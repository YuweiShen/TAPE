The method also involves character embedding, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of a contrastive loss function for character embedding is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of thresholding, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to text detection, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
