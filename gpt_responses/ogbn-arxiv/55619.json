Additionally, the paper discusses the use of architecture search and pruning, which are common techniques in machine learning and could place it in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper also discusses the use of constant weights and the discovery of digital circuits, which could potentially place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
