The paper also discusses the potential for the system to imitate human performance, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a metric to evaluate the performance of the detectors could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the potential for online applications, which could relate to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of image databases, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
