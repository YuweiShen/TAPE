The concept of rate of innovation is also related to compressed sensing (cs.SP) and sampling theory (cs.SI). The use of sampling kernels and the discussion of stability suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
