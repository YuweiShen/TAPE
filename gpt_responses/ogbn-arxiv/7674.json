The problem is also related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG), as submodular functions are commonly used in these fields. The paper uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) to design its algorithms. Additionally, the paper involves combinatorial optimization (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC) in its analysis of the approximation guarantees of the algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
