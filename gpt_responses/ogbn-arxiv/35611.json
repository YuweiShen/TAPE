The paper presents a new reparameterization of DNNs and develops a sample compression representation of the neural network. These topics are closely related to machine learning and neural networks, which are covered in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
