The paper also utilizes geographical information system (GIS) and National Centers for Environmental Information datasets, which involves data processing and analysis (cs.AI). The use of sensing and control data for real-time updates suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the application of feedback linearization for control falls under the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
