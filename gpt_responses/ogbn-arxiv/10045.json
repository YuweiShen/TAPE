This involves analyzing the impact of hardware imperfections on the performance of full-duplex systems, which falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a mathematical model to suppress the self-interference signal arising from hardware non-idealities, which involves system-level design and control, falling under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also involves measurements and analysis of the impact of hardware imperfections on the signal processing and modulation techniques used in full-duplex systems, which falls under the category of Multimedia (cs.MM) and Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
