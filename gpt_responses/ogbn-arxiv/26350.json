Additionally, the paper proposes a new framework for federated learning, which is a subfield of machine learning, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper also discusses the practical implementation of the proposed framework, which involves communication, computation, and storage, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DB (Databases) categories.
