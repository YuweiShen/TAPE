The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as in-network computation over sensor networks and module placement in distributed computing, suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Networked Systems (cs.NI), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
