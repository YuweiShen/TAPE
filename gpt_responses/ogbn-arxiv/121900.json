The main tool used in the paper is the McEliece encryption setting, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the linearized polynomial reconstruction problem, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The attack proposed by Overbeck is a well-known attack in the field of cryptography, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the security of a specific encryption scheme, which is a topic in security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
