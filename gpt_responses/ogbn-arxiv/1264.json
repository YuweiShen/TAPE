The paper proposes two alternative sparsity-promoting transformations for attention mechanisms, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.CL, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
