The paper also discusses the use of linear intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise, which are common in signal processing and networked systems (cs.SI, cs.NI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of pulse-amplitude modulation and quadratic-amplitude modulation constellations, which are commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
