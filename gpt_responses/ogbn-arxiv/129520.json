The proposed equalization loss is a novel technique for addressing the long tail of rare categories problem, which is a common issue in machine learning and can be tackled using methods from the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper achieves state-of-the-art results on the LVIS benchmark, which is a popular dataset in the multimedia (cs.MM) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
