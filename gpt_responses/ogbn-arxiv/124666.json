This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS), as well as distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG) since the proposed scheme involves iterative decoding. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the scheme in the presence of noise, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
