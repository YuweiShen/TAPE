The use of a density-aware decoder also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) techniques. Additionally, the problem of crowd counting has applications in robotics (cs.RO) for navigation and safety purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
