The use of an 1 norm for the constraint and loss function is also a common technique in sparse optimization (cs.DS). The datasets used in the experiments are from biological data, which suggests a possible connection to bioinformatics (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a novel constrained primal-dual method for optimization, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
