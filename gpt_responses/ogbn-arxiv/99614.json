This involves the use of discrete cosine transform (DCT) in FOFDM system instead of fast Fourier transform (FFT) in OFDM system to reduce computational complexity without affecting BER performance. The paper also compares the proposed scheme with DC-offset FOFDM (DCO-FOFDM) system with optimal DC-bias. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the improvement of BER performance in optical transmission systems, which involves the use of coding and modulation techniques to optimize information transfer. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of IM/DD optical transmission systems, which are commonly used in networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The paper proposes an improved receiving scheme for optimizing the performance of optical transmission systems. \n- cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper discusses the use of layered ACO-FOFDM and DCO-FOFDM systems in communication networks. \n- cs.PHOTONICS (Optics): The paper discusses the use of IM/DD optical transmission systems,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
