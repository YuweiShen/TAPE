This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves image processing and pattern recognition. The use of Multi_Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifiers and weighted majority voting technique indicates the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also discusses the comparison of their approach with other recent methods, which suggests the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the use of MLP classifiers indicates the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
