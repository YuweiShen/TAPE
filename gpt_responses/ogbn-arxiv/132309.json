This involves monitoring system activities and detecting abnormal behavior. The paper also introduces a domain-specific query language for expressing anomaly models. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
