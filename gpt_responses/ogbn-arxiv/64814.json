This falls under the category of hardware implementation of neural networks, which is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of LUT in architectures such as MLP and CNN, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoffs between accuracy and LUT size, which is related to system optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
