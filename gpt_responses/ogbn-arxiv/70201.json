It covers topics related to machine learning, deep learning, and responsible AI, which are all subcategories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely subcategories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect of XAI, as well as the cybersecurity (cs.CY) implications of implementing AI models. Finally, the paper also touches upon the accountability and transparency (cs.CR) aspects of responsible AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
