It introduces new variants of the Spectre attack, which is a well-known vulnerability in modern CPUs. The paper also discusses possible software mitigations and hardware defenses, which are typical topics in the field of cryptography and security.\n\n2. cs.AR (Architecture) - The paper focuses on microarchitectural side channels and their exploitation through speculative execution. It discusses the features of modern CPUs that make them vulnerable to these attacks and proposes hardware defenses to mitigate the risks. These topics are relevant to the field of computer architecture.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses software mitigations for speculative buffer overflows and control-flow attacks. It also mentions the construction of return-oriented-programming (ROP) gadgets, which are a software-level technique for building alternative attack payloads. These topics are relevant to the field of software engineering.\n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses control-flow attacks and the construction of ROP gadgets, which are techniques that rely on the manipulation of program control flow. These topics are relevant to the field of programming languages.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the features of modern CPUs that make them vulnerable to speculative execution attacks and proposes hardware defenses to mitigate the risks"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
