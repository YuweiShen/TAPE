The use of dynamic programming and approximation schemes suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC) or machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of minimizing the \\ell_p norm of completion times is related to optimization and mathematical programming, which could place the paper in the subfield of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the use of intervals of forbidden work suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT), where similar techniques are used to analyze the behavior of players in strategic situations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
