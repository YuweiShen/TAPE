The paper also proposes a rotation invariant model for point-cloud segmentation and classification, which involves geometric reasoning and robotics (cs.GR) as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses an omni-directional camera model, which is a common tool in robotics and computer vision (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
