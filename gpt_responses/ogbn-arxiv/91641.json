This falls under the category of natural language processing. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new approach to duration modelling for speech synthesis, which involves the use of a recurrent statistical model. This falls under the category of machine learning. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): There is no direct connection to social or information networks in the paper, but the proposed approach could potentially be used in applications such as chatbots or virtual assistants, which fall under this category. \n- cs.SDQ (Sound and Music Computing): The paper is about speech synthesis, which falls under the category of sound processing. However, this category is more specific to music-related applications, so it is less likely than cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
