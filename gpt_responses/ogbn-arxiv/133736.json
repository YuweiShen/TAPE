This involves creating a lexicon of root words and adding rules for generating inflectional and derivational words. The system is then used in a Part Of Speech (POS) Tagger based on Stanford POS Tagger. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as MAXENT (Maximum Entropy) approach for POS tagging, which makes cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. The use of FST also involves computational linguistics, which makes cs.CY (Computational Geometry) a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of FST and POS tagging involves pattern recognition and optimization, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
