It also involves the use of optical flow computation, which is a common technique in computer vision. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of video data, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which could be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
