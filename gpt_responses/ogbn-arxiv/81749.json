The use of neural architecture search (NAS) also suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. The evolutionary approach used in the NAS process could also place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of a mobile-friendly model size, which could suggest a connection to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) category, where mobile-friendly models are often used for tasks such as image recognition on mobile devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
