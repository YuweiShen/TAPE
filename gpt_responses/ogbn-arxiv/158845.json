The use of zero-forcing decoder and the impact of user mobility on the system performance suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and communication (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper provides asymptotic analysis results, which may be related to machine learning (cs.MA) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
