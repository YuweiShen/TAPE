The paper also makes use of human behavior to predict future links, which can be categorized under social and information networks (cs.SI). The proposed technique involves quantifying behavior similarity between nodes, which can be considered as a similarity measure (cs.SY). The paper also deals with temporal link prediction, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a tensor-based technique for link prediction, which can be considered as an application of machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
