The use of side information is a common theme in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication theory (cs.SY), which are related to the problem studied in the paper. Finally, the paper involves analyzing the phase transition of exact recovery, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
