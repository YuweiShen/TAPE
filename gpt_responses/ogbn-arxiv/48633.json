This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of multivariate polynomials and Cartesian product point sets also suggests a possible connection to Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the Feng-Rao bounds, which are related to coding theory and error-correcting codes, indicating a possible connection to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
