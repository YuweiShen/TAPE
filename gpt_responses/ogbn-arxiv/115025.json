The paper proposes a new algorithm for constructing roundtrip spanners in directed graphs, which is a specific type of spanner that preserves roundtrip distances. This problem is closely related to topics in computational geometry (cs.CG), graph algorithms (cs.DS), numerical analysis (cs.NA), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and game theory (cs.GT). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
