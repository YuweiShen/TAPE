The paper discusses various approaches to achieve space efficiency, such as linear probing and bucket cuckoo hashing, which are commonly used in the field of data structures and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of virtual memory overcommitting, which is a technique commonly used in database systems, suggesting that cs.DB (Databases) could also be a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on dynamic resizing and load balancing of hash tables suggests that cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) could also be relevant sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper's experimental evaluation of the proposed approach suggests that cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
