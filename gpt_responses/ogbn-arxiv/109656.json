Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a new method to increase robustness of recognition of noisy images without using data generation or sophisticated training techniques, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves training parameters independently for each stream, which can be related to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with image and video processing, which can be associated with the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
