The paper also discusses fairness properties, which are often studied in the context of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a new rule that is polynomial-time computable, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses stochastic dominance, which is a concept from probability theory, suggesting a connection to data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses participation and incentives, which are topics that are often studied in the field of social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
