The paper discusses the use of approximate models to save samples when learning a policy for a reinforcement learning problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the complexity of knowledge transfer, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
