The paper also discusses communication efficiency, which is a common concern in distributed computing, and thus the paper could also be categorized under \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC). The paper also deals with large datasets, which could fall under \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). The paper presents convergence guarantees, which could fall under \"Numerical Analysis\" (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed framework, which could fall under \"Multi-Agent Systems\" (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
