Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which is a common problem in array processing and radar systems, indicating that it may also belong to cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.SP (Signal Processing), or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper proposes a joint sparse recovery method, which is a technique used in machine learning and optimization, suggesting that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
