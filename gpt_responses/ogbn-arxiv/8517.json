The paper proposes a new method for cooperative localization that uses reciprocal observations of camera-fiducials to obviate the need for egomotion estimates and mutually observable world landmarks. This problem is closely related to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
