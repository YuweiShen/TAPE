The paper also discusses several strategies for choosing the positions to skip in the convolutional layers, which involves optimization techniques (cs.AI) and potentially neural architecture search (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on modern convolutional networks, which involves experimental analysis (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
