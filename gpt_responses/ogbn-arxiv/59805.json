The use of the $\\ell_p$-analysis optimization and the restricted $p$-isometry property suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The development of an iteratively reweighted method falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA), while the empirical results of computational experiments suggest that the paper may also belong to the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
