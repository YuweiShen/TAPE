This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of neural attentive mechanisms and prior maps generated with Gaussian functions suggests that the paper also belongs to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed architecture and the study of the contribution of each key component indicate that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on human eye fixations and center bias suggests that the paper may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
