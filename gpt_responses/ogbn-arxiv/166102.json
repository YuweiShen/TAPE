These problems are fundamental models in computer science and are studied in various subfields such as algorithms (cs.AL), data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper's focus on the parameterized versions of these problems suggests that it may be of interest to researchers in the parameterized complexity community, which is closely related to the above subfields. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.DS and cs.GT, followed by cs.AL, cs.IT, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
