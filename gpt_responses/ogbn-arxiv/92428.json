Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves game theory, which makes cs.GT (Game Theory) another likely sub-category. The robot-human interaction also involves robotics, which makes cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. The paper also deals with human-computer interaction, which makes cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) another possible sub-category.
