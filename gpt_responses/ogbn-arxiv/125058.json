The proposed system uses deep learning techniques, which are a subset of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning also involves training a neural network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of current defense techniques, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and system integration (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
