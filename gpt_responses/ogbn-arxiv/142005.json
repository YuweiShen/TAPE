The paper also uses various machine learning techniques such as keyword extraction and topic clustering, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). Additionally, the paper introduces a new measure called WESM based on word-embedding, which is a technique used in both NLP and ML. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
