This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which is commonly used in game searches, indicating a possible connection to the Decision Making (cs.DM) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which suggests a possible connection to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical benefits of not requiring problem-specific reduction rules, which could be relevant to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
