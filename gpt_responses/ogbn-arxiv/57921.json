The paper also addresses the issue of privacy and eavesdropping, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of multiple antennas and relay-assisted communication also involves signal processing and communication theory (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed strategies involve joint optimization of relay processing and precoding matrices, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
