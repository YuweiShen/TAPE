The paper also discusses the use of OpenFlow and OpenState, which are specific to network protocols and architectures (SY). The paper proposes a new mechanism for failure recovery, which involves computation and optimization (DC) of backup paths. Finally, the paper discusses the use of precomputed backup paths, which is related to information theory (IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
