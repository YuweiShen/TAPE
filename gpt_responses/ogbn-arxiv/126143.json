It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses the use of rotation invariants as features for machine learning. The paper also mentions the evaluation of similarity of shapes, which could fall under the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The construction of rotation invariants involves polynomial manipulation, which could be related to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of rotation invariants for fast evaluation, which could be related to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
