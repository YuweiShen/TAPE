The paper also discusses the use of physical constraints and modeling of scale changes, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning networks for this task could also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
