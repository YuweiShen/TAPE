The use of Gaussian noise and ImageNet dataset suggest that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of machine learning models also suggests that it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on adversarial perturbations suggests that it could be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the use of randomized smoothing suggests that it could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
