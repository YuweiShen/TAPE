The paper deals with question answering tasks, which are typically studied in the natural language processing (NLP) community. The paper proposes a novel architecture for multi-hop QA tasks that utilizes entailment models pre-trained on large scale datasets such as SNLI. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks, which are studied in sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques such as locating important sentences, which are studied in sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques such as incorporating importance weights, which are studied in sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
