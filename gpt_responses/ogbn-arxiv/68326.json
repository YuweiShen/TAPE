The methods presented in the paper are also relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as proximity queries are important for object detection and tracking. The paper involves bounding curves in a convex region, which is a common problem in computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also deals with collision detection, which is a key topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents efficient methods for computing bounds on obstacle proximity, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves decision-making and planning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
