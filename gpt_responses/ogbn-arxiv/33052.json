The experiments and analysis are conducted on the ImageNet dataset, which is commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CV). The proposed ReActNet involves the use of activation functions and a distributional loss, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the sensitivity of binary networks to activation distribution variations, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Lastly, the paper evaluates the proposed method's performance using metrics such as top-1 accuracy, which is commonly used in multimedia research (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
