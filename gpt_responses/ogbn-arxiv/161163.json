This involves information extraction methods commonly used to construct knowledge bases, which falls under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also proposes a multi-layer probabilistic model for joint inference to distinguish errors made in the extraction process from factual errors in the web source per se, which involves Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also deals with a database of 2.8B facts extracted from the web, which involves Database (cs.DB) techniques. Finally, the paper proposes a way to compute the trustworthiness score, which involves Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IR, cs.CL, cs.DB, cs.AI, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
