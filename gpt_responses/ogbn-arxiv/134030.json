The paper proposes a nonconvex formulation for this problem and uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods to solve it efficiently. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
