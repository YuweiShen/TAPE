The use of shared attention modeling and attentional push also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories. Finally, the incorporation of attention modeling algorithms to improve prediction accuracy could also relate to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
