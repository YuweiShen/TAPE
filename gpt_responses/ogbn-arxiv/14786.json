The specific type of planning discussed is Partial Order Causal Link (POCL) Planning, which falls under the subfield of planning (cs.PL). The paper also mentions supervised learning and online error minimization, which are both topics in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of learned models to improve performance can also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
