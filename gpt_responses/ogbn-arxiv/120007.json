The paper presents a new proof for the PhaseMax algorithm, which is a convex formulation for phase retrieval via linear programming in the natural parameter space. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
