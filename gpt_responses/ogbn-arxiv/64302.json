The use of temperature scaling and the proposal of a new loss function are techniques commonly used in the subfields of machine learning, such as deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on deep neural networks, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
