However, since the focus is on developing a communication efficient algorithm for kernel PCA, cs.LG and cs.DC are the most likely categories. The use of subspace embedding and adaptive sampling techniques also suggests a potential fit with cs.DS and cs.DM. Finally, the experiments with real-world datasets could also make cs.CV a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
