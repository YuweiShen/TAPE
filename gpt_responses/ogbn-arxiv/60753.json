The use of stochastic geometry to analyze cellular systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the Mathematical Physics (cs.MP) sub-category. The proposed model for interference distribution and its approximation using the Gamma distribution may fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of Voronoi cells and Poisson point processes in the analysis may suggest that the paper belongs to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. However, since the focus of the paper is on wireless communication systems, the other sub-categories are more likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
