This involves defining the inference process as the minimization of a convex function, which is inspired by free energy approximations. The paper also discusses learning directly in terms of the performance of the inference process at univariate marginal prediction. Given these topics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
