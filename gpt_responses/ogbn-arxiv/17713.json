Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also introduces a novel task formulation and an attention mechanism, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of ECG signals and the focus on heartbeats could also place it in cs.CY (Computational Biology) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
