The paper proposes a new method for domain adaptation that improves feature transferability by explicitly enforcing the feature extractor to ignore the task-irrelevant factors and focus on the information that is essential to the task of interest for both source and target domains. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
