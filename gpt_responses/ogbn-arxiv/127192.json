Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a new algorithm for extracting candidate syntactic constituents and introduces novel features for use in SRL, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses linguistic features and achieves a high accuracy, which could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
