The proposed metric, FCD, is based on a deep neural network called ChemblNet, which was trained to predict drug activities. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
