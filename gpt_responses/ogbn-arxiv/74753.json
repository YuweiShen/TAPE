This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also proposes a new network architecture for learning binary hashing codes, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which involves multimedia analysis (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
