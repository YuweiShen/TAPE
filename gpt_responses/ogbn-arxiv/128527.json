The protocol is tested on real-world social network datasets, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI) and social computing (cs.SOC). The paper also discusses the use of memory and neighbor selection policies, which are related to network protocols and algorithms (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents improvements to the protocol based on experimental simulations, which involves the analysis of data and algorithms (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
