Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel strategy to address the data deficiency problem, which involves selecting semantically similar images on the fly and using them to enhance the labeled data. This strategy involves machine learning techniques such as pseudo labeling and continual learning, which are relevant to subcategories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of feature representation and decision functions, which are relevant to subcategories such as cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
