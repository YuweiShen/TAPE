This topic falls under the scope of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the directed dominating set problem, which is a classic problem in computational complexity (cs.CC) and parameterized complexity (cs.DS). The nowhere crownful classes of directed graphs studied in the paper include planar and bounded-genus graphs, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
