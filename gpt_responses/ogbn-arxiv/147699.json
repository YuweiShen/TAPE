This task falls under the information retrieval (IR) domain, which is covered by the cs.IR sub-category. Additionally, the paper utilizes state-of-the-art visual feature extraction methods, such as transfer learning from pre-trained image classification models and synthetic saliency heat maps, which are commonly used in computer vision (CV) and multimedia (MM) research. The paper also mentions the use of non-visual features and relevance judgments, which are relevant to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) research, covered by the cs.CL and cs.LG sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
