The paper also involves the sharing of codebook, which is a common technique in wireless networking (cs.NI). The paper specifically focuses on the capacity penalty to the primary user, which is a key concern in cognitive radio systems (cs.CR). The paper also proposes new approaches and analyzes their performance, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper provides numerical examples to compare the performance of different approaches, which involves the use of simulations and modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
