This involves the use of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) technology, which is a subfield of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a novel scheme for sharing time-frequency resources, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the spatial multiplexing properties of mMIMO, which is a key feature of wireless communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the coexistence of HTC and MTC services, which is a topic of interest in communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
