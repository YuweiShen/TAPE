The use of convolutional neural networks and image augmentation techniques also suggests that the paper belongs to this sub-category. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the segmentation of individual teeth from CBCT images, which is a common application in the field of multimedia. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a neural network-based approach for tooth segmentation, which involves the use of pose regression, convolutional detectors, and CNNs. This suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-category of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an AI-based approach for tooth segmentation from CBCT images, which involves the use of neural networks and image augmentation techniques. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - The paper proposes a neural network-based approach for tooth segmentation from CBCT images, which involves the use of pose regression, convolutional detectors, and CNNs.
