The proposed structure, called Higher Order Recurrent Neural Networks (HORNNs), is applicable to a variety of sequence modeling tasks, including language modeling. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, since the paper proposes a new neural network structure, it is likely to be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which are all related to developing and improving machine learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
