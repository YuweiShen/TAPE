The paper provides bounds on the number of phrases in the parsings and gives examples to show that these bounds are tight. This work involves the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.LG) as the authors use techniques from these areas to analyze the different variants of the LZ77 parsing algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
