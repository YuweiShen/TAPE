This is a core concept in programming languages and is likely to be classified under this sub-category.\n2. cs.TYPES (Type Theory): The paper deals with the typing of patterns in a path polymorphic system. This is a core concept in type theory and is likely to be classified under this sub-category.\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper addresses the fundamental properties of Subject Reduction and Progress that guarantee a well-behaved dynamics. These are core concepts in logic in computer science and are likely to be classified under this sub-category.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the ability to define functions that can operate uniformly over arbitrary recursively specified data structures. This is a core concept in data structures and algorithms and is likely to be classified under this sub-category.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a static type system for a pattern calculus that captures the feature of path polymorphism. This is a core concept in software engineering and is likely to be classified under this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
