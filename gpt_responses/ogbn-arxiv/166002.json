The problem of finding dissimilar explanations can also be seen as a clustering problem, which falls under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions decision support systems, which is a topic in databases (cs.DB). Finally, the complexity analysis of the problem suggests that it may be of interest to the computational complexity community (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
