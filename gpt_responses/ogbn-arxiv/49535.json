The proposed technique involves error-correcting codes, which is also a topic in information theory. The paper also deals with inverse problems in machine learning on graphs, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a strategy for combining outputs of all workers, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
