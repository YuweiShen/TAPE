This is a problem commonly encountered in machine learning and statistics, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses Fourier transform and Bochner's theorem, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the time complexity of the proposed method, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical properties of the proposed method, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
