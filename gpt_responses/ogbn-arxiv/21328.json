This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves linear transformations and optimization techniques, which are relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also deals with communication engineering (cs.CE) concepts such as antenna configurations and channel ranks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
