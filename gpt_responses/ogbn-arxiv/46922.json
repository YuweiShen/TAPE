The paper proposes a novel approach to address the Zero-Shot classification task (ZSC) and Generalized Zero-Shot Classification (GZSC) by generating artificial training examples for categories without exemplars. This approach involves learning a conditional generator using seen classes, which falls under the category of generative models (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of previous methods and proposes a new approach, which involves using semantic descriptions to classify images, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on various datasets, which involves evaluating the performance of the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
