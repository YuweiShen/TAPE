This involves crawling a collection of visualizations, extracting data, data-encoding marks, encodings, axes, and other non-data-encoding attributes of marks, and indexing this information along with metadata about the webpage containing the chart. The paper also discusses how visualization developers and researchers can use the search engine to explore the space of possible designs and identify commonly used visual design patterns. Given this focus on information retrieval, human-computer interaction, and data management, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Databases (cs.DB), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
