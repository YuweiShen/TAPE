The use of convex duality and linear programming also suggests a connection to optimization and data structures (cs.DS). The mention of norm-product message-passing and convergence properties may also indicate a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
