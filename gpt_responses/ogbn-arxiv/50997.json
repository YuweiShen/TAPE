This is a common topic in machine learning and falls under the category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the problem of selecting a subset of components for the computation of the consensus, which is related to \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Data Mining\" (cs.DM). The evaluation conducted on heterogeneous data and methods suggests that the paper may also be relevant to \"Computer Vision\" (cs.CV) and \"Social and Information Networks\" (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
