This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is the main focus of cs.LG. \n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper specifically deals with neural networks and their activation functions, which is a subfield of neural computing. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Neural networks are a popular tool in the field of artificial intelligence, and the paper proposes a new method for improving their performance on regression tasks. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While the paper does not focus on computer vision specifically, neural networks are commonly used in this field and the proposed activation function could potentially be applied to computer vision tasks. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is less likely, but neural networks are sometimes used in social network analysis and the proposed activation function could potentially be applied in this context."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
