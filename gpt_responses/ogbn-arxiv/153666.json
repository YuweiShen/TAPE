The approach is based on recent advances in Deep Learning (cs.LG) and involves formulating the pose estimation as a regression problem (cs.AI). The method is evaluated on real-world images, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
