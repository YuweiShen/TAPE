The proposed approach involves designing an adaptive sparse graphical representation scheme and a spatial partition-based discriminant analysis framework, which are both machine learning techniques. Therefore, it is likely that this paper also falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves working with different types of face images, including sketches and infrared images, which could fall under the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
