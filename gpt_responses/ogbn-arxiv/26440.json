This involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) since the representations are learned in an embodied setting. Additionally, the paper discusses natural language processing (cs.CL) in the context of the tasks used to evaluate the visual representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
