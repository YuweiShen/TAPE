This falls under the scope of natural language processing and computational linguistics, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a neural network model for dependency parsing, which involves training a machine learning algorithm. This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is a subfield of CS.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a model for improving cross-lingual dependency parsing, which involves using English syntactic knowledge to train a neural network model for Singlish. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, which is a subfield of CS.AI.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a neural network model for dependency parsing, which involves training a neural network algorithm.
