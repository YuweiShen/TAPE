The paper also discusses the computational difficulty of finding manipulations, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and algorithmic game theory (cs.GT). The paper also mentions approximation methods, which are often used in optimization and machine learning (cs.DS, cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of the combined voting rule, which is related to the study of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
