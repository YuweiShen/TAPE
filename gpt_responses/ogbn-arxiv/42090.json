This paper proposes a method for multi-view learning in Radiomics, which is a subfield of medical imaging and closely related to computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed method is based on multiple classifiers and dynamic weighted voting, which are common techniques in machine learning. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing state-of-the-art works in Radiomics and the potential of multi-view learning methods.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Radiomics is an application of artificial intelligence in healthcare, and the proposed method aims to improve the personalization of cancer diagnosis and treatment using machine learning techniques.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - Radiomics involves the extraction and analysis of large amounts of data from medical images, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed method may have applications in improving the retrieval of relevant information from medical images for cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Radiomics involves the analysis of medical images, which are a type of multimedia data. The proposed method may have applications in improving the analysis and classification of multimedia data for medical diagnosis and treatment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
