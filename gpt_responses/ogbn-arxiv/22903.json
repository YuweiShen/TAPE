The paper specifically focuses on the effect of power normalization techniques on the performance of the precoding schemes, which is a key aspect of information theory and signal processing. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.SI are the most likely categories. However, the paper also considers channel estimation, pilot contamination, and per-user channel correlation, which are relevant to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of the considered precoding schemes, which is relevant to computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
