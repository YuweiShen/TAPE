The use of meta-learning to handle statistical and systematic challenges in federated learning suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. The distributed nature of the network of mobile devices and the need for efficient communication and privacy preservation suggest a possible fit with the sub-categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the empirical evaluation on datasets and real-world production data suggests a possible connection with computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
