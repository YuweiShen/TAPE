The construction is based on the Hermitian function field, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and coding theory (cs.CR). The use of collinear rational places and rational functions suggests a connection to computational geometry and algorithms (cs.DS). The resulting sequences may have applications in cryptography and security (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves mathematical optimization and numerical analysis in finding the optimal parameters for the construction (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
