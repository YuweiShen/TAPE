The paper also involves the study of interference channels, which can be categorized under cs.NI (networking and internet architecture). The use of state sequences in the channel also suggests a possible categorization under cs.SI (signal processing). The study of Gaussian channels and their capacity region can be categorized under cs.MM (machine learning) or cs.LG (learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
