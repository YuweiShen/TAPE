The use of high-resolution sensors suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) techniques may be employed. The proposed filter is a probabilistic model, which is a common approach in control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Gaussian processes and fusion mapping suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) techniques may also be employed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
