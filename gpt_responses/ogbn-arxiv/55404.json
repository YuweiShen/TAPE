Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity), which deals with the study of the inherent difficulty of computational problems. The paper also involves the creation and manipulation of data structures, which suggests the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the language as a class library in Python, which relates to the sub-category cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper mentions the potential use of the language for creating visual editing tools, which suggests the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
