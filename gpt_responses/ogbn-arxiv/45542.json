The paper also proposes a framework for automatically finding such vulnerabilities, which involves software engineering techniques (cs.SE). The framework is implemented in a way that is independent of the specific programming language or algorithm being tested, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the framework in terms of its impact on production systems, which relates to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
