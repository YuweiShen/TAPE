It also involves algebraic manipulation and analysis of functions, which falls under computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the properties of these functions, such as regularity and duality, which are related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper mentions the potential applications of these functions in coding theory and cryptography, which could fall under signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
