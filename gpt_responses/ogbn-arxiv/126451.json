This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper talks about the application of NOMA in LTE and 5G networks, which is a networking and internet architecture topic.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the interplay between NOMA and cognitive radio, which is a communication and networking topic.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses cooperative NOMA, which involves the coordination of multiple systems, and hence falls under the domain of systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper briefly mentions the combination of NOMA with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, which is a multimedia topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
