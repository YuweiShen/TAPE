The optimization techniques used in the paper are gradient-based (cs.LG) and the paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) as it aims to preserve semantic similarity. The experiments are conducted on image datasets (cs.MM) and the paper also draws inspiration from Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
