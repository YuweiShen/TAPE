The paper also demonstrates the flexibility of the resulting optimizer on decision making tasks, which is a common application of machine learning. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to exploit and cache local structure in the model. This is a common topic in data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the use of logical features in the modeling language, which often involves discrete mathematics. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses a modeling language for probabilistic inference, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of an interior-point method to compute approximate solutions in a generic way, which is a common topic in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
