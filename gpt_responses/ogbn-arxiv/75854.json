The paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence in two different settings: an exam practice assistant and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive disability. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, the paper discusses human-computer interaction and the affective aspects of it, which makes cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) another likely sub-category. The paper also uses probabilistic models, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
