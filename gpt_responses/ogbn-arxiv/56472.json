The use of algorithms to build a lookup table and search for ideal control gains suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the numerical simulation aspect of the study suggests the possibility of it being categorized under cs.MA (multi-agent systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
