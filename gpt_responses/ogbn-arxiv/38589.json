The use of Support Vector Machines for document classification suggests a connection to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The mention of large scale problems in document clustering suggests a connection to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. The use of the K-tree clustering algorithm suggests a connection to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
