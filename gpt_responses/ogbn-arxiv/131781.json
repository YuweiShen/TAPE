The use of $L_1$ regularization and greedy algorithms for feature selection are also mentioned, which are techniques that are often used in the field of optimization and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves experimental comparisons of different algorithms, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
