Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. As the paper deals with security and attacks on deep learning models, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a possible sub-category.
