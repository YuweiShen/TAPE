This involves learning a forward prediction model that maps program inputs to execution traces, and using this model to guide exploration by focusing on inputs that the model is uncertain about. This work involves aspects of software engineering (cs.SE), computer security (cs.CR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), programming languages (cs.PL), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
