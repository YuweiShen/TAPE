The paper proposes a modification to existing distributed estimation strategies to handle situations where agents are subject to data from unknown different sources. This modification involves developing a classification scheme for the agents to identify the models that generated the data and proposing a procedure by which the entire network can be made to converge towards the same model through a collaborative decision-making process. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
