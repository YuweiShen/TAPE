This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.DM, cs.GR). The paper also discusses trade-offs between space and number of passes, which is a common theme in algorithm design and analysis (cs.AL). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which involves implementation and evaluation of algorithms (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
