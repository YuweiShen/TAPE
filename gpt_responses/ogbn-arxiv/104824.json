This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes the use of random matrix theory, which is a common tool in signal processing and information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.SI, cs.LG, cs.NA, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
