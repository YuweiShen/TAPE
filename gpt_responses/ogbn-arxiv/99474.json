The paper discusses the use of dirty paper coding and zero-forcing precoding, which are techniques commonly used in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the scaling of system throughput with the number of antennas, which is a topic of interest in networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper specifically focuses on massive MIMO systems, which is a topic within the broader field of multimedia communications (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between uplink and downlink capacity, which is a topic within the field of computer networking (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
