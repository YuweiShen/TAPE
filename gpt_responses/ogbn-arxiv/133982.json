This involves a game theoretic framework in which each object to be clustered is represented as a player, which has to choose its cluster membership. The paper discusses the optimization part of the NMF method and proposes a model that improves the performances of many NMF formulations. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as they are closely related to the proposed method. The paper also involves clustering, so cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
