The specific application of image reconstruction suggests that Computer Vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of optimization techniques such as $\\ell_1$-minimization and total variation minimization, which are commonly studied in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the development of a new framework for measuring coherence in sparse recovery problems, which may be of interest to researchers in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
