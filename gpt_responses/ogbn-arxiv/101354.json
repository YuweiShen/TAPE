The approach involves modeling cognitive events based on EEG data using EEG optical flow and designing a deep transfer learning framework suitable for transferring knowledge by joint training. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
