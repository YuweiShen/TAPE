The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from raw speech signals is a recent development in the field of speech recognition, which is closely related to the sub-categories of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Therefore, cs.SD (sound) and cs.CL (computation and language) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the comparison of different ANN architectures, which involves optimization and training of the models, making cs.LG (machine learning) another likely sub-category. The use of CNNs for feature extraction is a novel approach, which falls under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the estimation of phoneme class conditional probabilities, which is a specific task in speech recognition and NLP, making cs.AI (artificial intelligence) another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
