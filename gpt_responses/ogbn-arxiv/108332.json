The paper introduces a method for converting text data into abstract image representations, which allows image-based processing techniques to be applied to text-based comparison problems. This method is applied to entity disambiguation of inventor names in US patents, which involves both text and image datasets. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks, which are relevant to sub-categories such as information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
