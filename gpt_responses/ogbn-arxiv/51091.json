The proposed approach involves training a neural network classifier using multiple datasets, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a hierarchical label set and partial label loss also suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
