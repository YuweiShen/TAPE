This involves training a convolutional neural network to predict grasp success based on visual information and grasp configuration, and then formulating grasp planning as inferring the grasp configuration that maximizes the probability of success. The paper also validates the approach through experiments on real robots. Given the focus on robotics and computer vision, as well as the use of deep neural networks, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
