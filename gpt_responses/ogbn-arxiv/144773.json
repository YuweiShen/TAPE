The paper specifically focuses on Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), which are widely used in various applications such as computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data mining (cs.DS). The paper proposes several ways of extending the framework to non-parametric GBDT ensembles, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed approaches on various experimental setups and use-case scenarios, which involves statistical analysis (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
