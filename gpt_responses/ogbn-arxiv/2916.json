The use of solution heuristics and parallelization strategies suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the mention of near-optimal solutions and computational experiments suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
