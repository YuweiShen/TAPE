Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves learning from data, which suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as another likely sub-category. The use of FOND planners and the focus on abstract actions and features suggest cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.RO (Robotics) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with planning in dynamic environments, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
