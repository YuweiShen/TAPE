The use of a novel parametrization that is agnostic to the underlying diffusion model and statistically efficient to learn from data suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The development of a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm for a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on experimental evaluation suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the overall topic of influence maximization in social networks suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.SOC (Computational Social Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
