This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the effects of infrared, distance, and brightness on mouse input, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The transmission rate and the use of LED as a transmitter involve information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the susceptibility of infrared mice to similar attacks, which relates to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system security (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
