The model is trained using relational inference, intention estimation, and causal reasoning. This work involves computer vision (to encode relational interactions of vehicles using the perceptual context), artificial intelligence (to estimate the probability distribution of intentional goals based on the inferred relations), machine learning (to reason about the behavior of vehicles as future locations conditioned on the intention), and robotics (to forecast trajectories of vehicles). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves robotics, which falls under cs.RO (Robotics) and natural language processing, which falls under cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
