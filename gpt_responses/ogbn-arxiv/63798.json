Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also presents a convex program (SDP) for solving the problem, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses rigidity theory, which is related to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
