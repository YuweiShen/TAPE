The paper also discusses statistical estimation, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the convergence rates of differentially private approximations, which is a topic that is relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
