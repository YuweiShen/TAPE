This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the problem of maximizing the effective capacity (EC) of the user subject to both per-RRH average-and peak-power constraints, which involves optimizing the transmission power of each radio remote head (RRH). This falls under the domain of information theory. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a quality-of-service (QoS) driven power-and rate-adaptation scheme for wireless cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), which involves jointly supporting the users by efficiently exploiting the enhanced spatial degrees of freedom attained by the powerful cloud computing facilitated by the BBU pool. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper involves the optimization of the transmission power of each radio remote head (RRH) in a wireless cloud radio access network (C-RAN), which involves the hardware architecture of the network."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
