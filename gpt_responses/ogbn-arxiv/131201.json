The proposed approach involves regularization of the center-lines or surfaces of the structures, which is a technique commonly used in graphics and robotics. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.GR (Graphics), and cs.RO (Robotics and Control). The paper also mentions the use of optimization algorithms, which suggests the sub-categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as possible options."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
