The proposed method involves incorporating weakly supervised learning techniques, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of Multiple Instance Learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve datasets commonly used in multimedia analysis (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
