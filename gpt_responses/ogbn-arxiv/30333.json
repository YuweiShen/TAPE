The paper also discusses the use of classical approaches such as nonlinear diffusion and regularisation, which are topics in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper introduces new families of activation functions, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.NA, cs.IT, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
