This falls under the scope of numerical analysis.\n2. cs.EM (Electromagnetism): The paper deals with the fabrication and characterization of an optical device, which involves the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter. This makes cs.EM a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The use of an adjoint-based error indicator to further reduce computational complexity suggests that optimization and control techniques are being employed in the study.\n4. cs.OT (Optics and Photonics): The paper deals with the fabrication and characterization of an optical device, which falls under the scope of optics and photonics.\n5. cs.MM (Materials Modeling): The paper deals with the propagation of uncertainties in material and geometry to the scattering parameters of the system. This suggests that materials modeling techniques are being employed in the study."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
