This is particularly relevant to computer vision tasks, which are typically categorized under cs.CV. The paper also presents empirical results on ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, which are commonly used in the computer vision community. Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves designing a building block called Selective Kernel (SK) unit, which is a novel contribution to the field of deep learning. This makes it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks and fall under cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper involves optimizing the model complexity, which is relevant to sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
