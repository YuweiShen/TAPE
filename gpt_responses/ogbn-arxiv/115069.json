The proposed framework is evaluated extensively on image classification tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach to layer-wise quantization, which could be of interest to researchers in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of computational efficiency, which could be relevant to researchers in data structures (cs.DS) who are interested in optimizing algorithms for resource-constrained environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
