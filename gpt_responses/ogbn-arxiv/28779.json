This can be viewed as a game-theoretic problem, where investors are players and their adoption choices are strategies. \n- cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The paper highlights the importance of security as a key feature of crypto assets, and how it affects investors' adoption choices. The framework also considers the security-stability trade-off in selecting crypto assets. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Similar to cs.CY, the paper discusses the security aspect of crypto assets and how it impacts investment decisions. The framework also takes into account the governance (stability) aspect of crypto assets. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a recommender app that assists investors in making adoption choices based on their preferences and the characteristics of the crypto assets. This involves using machine learning algorithms to provide recommendations based on the adoption choices of all investors and expected future economic benefits. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper considers the behaviour of different types of investors and how their attitudes towards the features of crypto assets affect their adoption choices. This can be viewed as a social network problem, where investors are nodes and their adoption"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
