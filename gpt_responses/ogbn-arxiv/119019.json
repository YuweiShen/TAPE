The paper also deals with visual aspects of the environment, which suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the proposed regularization method involves modifying the agent's state representations, which could be considered an aspect of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
