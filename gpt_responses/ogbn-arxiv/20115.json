The paper proposes two neural network models for retrieving out-of-vocabulary words in speech recognition, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, which could fall under sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the processing of audio data, which could fall under sub-categories such as sound (cs.SD) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
