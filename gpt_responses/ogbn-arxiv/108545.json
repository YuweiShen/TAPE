The paper also discusses the spatially-coupled version of these codes, which involves the use of networks and communication systems (cs.NI) and the analysis of their performance. Additionally, the paper presents upper bounds on the minimum distance, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization (cs.SI). The use of arrays and quasi-cyclic codes also suggests a possible connection to the distributed systems (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the computer communication (cs.CC) sub-category, as it deals with the performance of communication systems and codes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
