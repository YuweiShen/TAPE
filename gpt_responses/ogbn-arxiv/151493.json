Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with cybersecurity and malicious software, which suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper analyzes the source code of malware, which could fall under cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SD (Software Development and Management).
