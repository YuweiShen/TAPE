The paper also introduces a classifier calibration module, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of residual learning is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed architecture, which is relevant to mobile and embedded vision problems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
