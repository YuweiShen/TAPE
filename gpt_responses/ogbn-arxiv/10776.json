The use of adaptive object re-identification involves machine learning techniques, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The iterative application of the two modules suggests the use of optimization algorithms, which is a common topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also involves flow warping, which is a technique used in video processing and multimedia (cs.MM).
