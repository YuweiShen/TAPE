It also involves the presence of an eavesdropper, which is a common theme in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of probability distributions and distillation properties suggests a connection to probability theory and algorithms (cs.DS). The design of cryptographic scenarios involves the use of computational techniques (cs.CC). Finally, the study of secret correlations and bound information may fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
