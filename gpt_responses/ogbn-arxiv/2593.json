The approach leverages arXiv's corpus of scientific preprints, which is primarily focused on computer science. The paper also mentions using subject tags chosen by authors, which suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper's main topic is artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and it mentions using machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.DL) to classify papers. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL, cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
