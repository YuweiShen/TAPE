The use of asynchronous parallel computing is a key aspect of the proposed approach, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also involves optimization, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the proposed approach may have applications in control systems (cs.SY) where real-time processing is important."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
