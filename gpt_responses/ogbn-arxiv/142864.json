The proposed method involves distillation-based learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the issue of biased predictions towards the background class, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
