The paper also discusses the use of shared internal models and training methods, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The concept of empowerment, which involves the agent's ability to control its own future, is also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of homeostatic drives and information gain, which are relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
