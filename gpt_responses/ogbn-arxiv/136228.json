This involves the use of mathematical tools for evaluating the properties of the PUF tokens, as well as the testing of software algorithms for key extraction and error correction. The paper also discusses the design considerations for a miniaturized, energy-efficient, and low-cost device. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Information Theory (cs.IT), Other Computer Science (cs.OH), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Emerging Technologies (cs.ET), and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
