Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses a retrieval-based recognition system, which involves information retrieval and natural language processing techniques, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which falls under cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.DL (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the lack of training data and proposes a method to make full use of scarce data, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
