It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as depth prediction is important for robot navigation and perception. The use of a loss term to enforce geometric constraints suggests that this paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper's focus on improving depth prediction accuracy suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of point clouds and surface normals suggests that this paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
