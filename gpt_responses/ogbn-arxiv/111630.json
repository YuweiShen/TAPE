Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the Raspberry Pi 3 platform for this task, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also evaluates cache partitioning and memory bandwidth throttling techniques, which are related to computer architecture (cs.AR) and operating systems (cs.OS) sub-categories. However, since the focus of the paper is on the application of deep learning for autonomous driving, we consider cs.AI and cs.EM (emerging technologies) as more likely sub-categories than cs.AR and cs.OS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
