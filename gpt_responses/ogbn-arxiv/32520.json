The paper also discusses the use of sequence-to-sequence models, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method involves pre-training on a large corpus of data, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of data augmentation to improve performance, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
