Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a new data collection scheme based on grammatical constraints for surface realization, which falls under the category of natural language processing, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) another likely category. The proposed two-stream modular attention network involves machine learning techniques, which can be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for a robust system arising from replacing ground truth visual annotations with automatic video object detector and temporal event localization, which can be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
