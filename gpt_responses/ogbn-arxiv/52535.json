Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses sampling algorithms and sub-linear time algorithms, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also mentions beyond worst-case analysis, which is related to theoretical computer science (cs.THE) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the MEB with outliers problem, which is related to data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
