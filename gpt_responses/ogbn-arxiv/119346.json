The proposed method is evaluated on various computer vision problems, such as subspace clustering, weather artifact removal, and simultaneous multi-image alignment and rectification. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Additionally, the paper involves developing a range propagation method, which could also fit into cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
