This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The use of polynomial kernel expansion and the potential for poorly conditioned matrices suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant. The use of empirical Bayes and approximate message passing suggests that statistical inference (cs.SI) may also be relevant. Finally, the focus on nonlinear function estimation suggests that artificial intelligence (cs.AI) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
