The paper also presents demonstrations of two wide-area measurement-based controls - system separation control and hierarchical voltage control. These aspects suggest that the paper belongs to the Systems and Control sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a decoupled architecture composed of a software-defined network and integrated over industry-standard communication protocols. This suggests that the paper belongs to the Networking and Internet Architecture sub-category.\n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions a scripting language environment for prototyping an EMS system and a control system. This suggests that the paper belongs to the Programming Languages sub-category.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a cyber-physical testbed design and implementation that involves multiple components and systems, which suggests that the paper belongs to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing sub-category.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper mentions the use of open-source software packages managed by a Python dispatcher. This suggests that the paper belongs to the Software Engineering sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
