Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also uses semantic representations and similarity measures, which are common in computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses a test collection based on Wikipedia tables, which suggests a potential connection to databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
