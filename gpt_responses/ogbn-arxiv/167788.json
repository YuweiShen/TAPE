This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The use of deep supervision and skip connections are also common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of CT scans for medical imaging analysis suggests a possible fit with multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
