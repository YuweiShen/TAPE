The paper specifically focuses on stochastic processes with memory, which falls under the subfield of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also discusses the polarization of processes, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI). The use of the Ar\\i{}kan transform is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG).
