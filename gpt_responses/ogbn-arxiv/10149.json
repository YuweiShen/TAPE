The paper focuses on improving the generality, robustness, and efficiency of DCNNs for object recognition tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a new DCNN design strategy that combines traditional filter banks' structural image priors with modern deep learning's capability to model complex non-linear functions hidden in training data. This approach involves regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the paper is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's experimental results involve object recognition tasks, which are commonly studied in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
