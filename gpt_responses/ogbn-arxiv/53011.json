The equational calculus $\\lambda_{\\mathsf{coop}}$ presented in the paper also suggests a logical approach to programming (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the modular definition of intermediate virtual machines, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE). The linear use of resources and execution of finalisation code mentioned in the paper also suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides a prototype language implementation in OCaml and a Haskell library, which suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
