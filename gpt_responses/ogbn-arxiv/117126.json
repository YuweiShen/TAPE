The proposed mechanism involves rate-limiting rules, which can be seen as a data structure or algorithmic technique (cs.DS). The system is designed to work with existing data collection systems, which implies a connection to databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions empirical evaluation, which suggests a focus on machine learning or data analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the proposed system involves deploying protection on existing systems, which implies a software engineering aspect (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
