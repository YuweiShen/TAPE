The paper proposes a novel approach for multi-scale matching using a deep neural network with a cross pyramid-level semantic alignment loss function. This approach is evaluated on two large person search benchmarking datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV) as the paper deals with image analysis and object detection. The second likely category is multimedia (cs.MM) as the paper deals with multi-scale matching. The third likely category is machine learning (cs.LG) as the paper proposes a deep learning approach. The fourth likely category is artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as the paper deals with developing intelligent systems for person search. The fifth likely category is information retrieval (cs.IR) as the paper deals with searching for specific objects (persons) in images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
