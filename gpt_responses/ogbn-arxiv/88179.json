The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for algorithm selection (cs.LG) and the potential for using optimization algorithms (cs.NE) in continuous and mixed discrete/continuous problems. Additionally, the paper discusses the conceptually related approaches of algorithm configuration, scheduling, and portfolio selection, which are relevant to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
