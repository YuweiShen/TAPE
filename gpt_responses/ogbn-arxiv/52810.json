This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The proposed algorithm also involves optimization techniques such as semidefinite programming (cs.NA) and Lagrange duality (cs.DS). The experiments involve real-world image data sets (cs.CV) and demonstrate improved clustering performance (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
