The proposed system, AnyThreat, involves machine learning techniques such as oversampling and classification, which fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the importance of feature engineering and class decomposition, which are common topics in software engineering (cs.SE) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed system involves synthetic data sets, which is a common practice in information science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
