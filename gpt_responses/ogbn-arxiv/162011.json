The proposed approach, multimodal co-training, involves jointly learning classifiers for multiple modalities, which suggests a connection to multimodal learning (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of metadata to collect training data, which is a topic related to information retrieval (cs.IR). The approach involves selecting good examples from noisy training data, which is a task related to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of classifiers to classify videos, which is a task related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
