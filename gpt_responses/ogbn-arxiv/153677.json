The focus is on multiband signals, which are sparse in the frequency domain, making it likely that the paper falls under the subcategory of sparse signal processing (cs.SI). The proposed system involves hardware implementation and digital processing, which could also place it in the categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
