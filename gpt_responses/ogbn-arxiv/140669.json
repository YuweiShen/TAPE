This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also introduces a new loss function for multi-task learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of satellite imagery also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
