It includes security analysis and privacy preservation mechanisms, which are typical topics in the cryptography and security field.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with the storage and sharing of EMRs, which are a type of healthcare data. The proposed solution involves storing the original EMRs in the cloud and using a tamper-proof consortium blockchain to store the indexes. This involves database-related issues such as data storage, indexing, and retrieval.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the issue of data sharing in healthcare, which has social implications. The proposed solution aims to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs by enabling secure and efficient data sharing.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a blockchain-based solution for data sharing, which involves distributed computing and consensus mechanisms. The use of smart contracts and access control mechanisms also involves distributed computing concepts.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a software solution for data sharing using blockchain technology. It involves the design and implementation of smart contracts, access control mechanisms, and privacy preservation mechanisms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
