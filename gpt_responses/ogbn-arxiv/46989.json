The proposed method involves generating future frames, which can also be categorized under generative models (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on video datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks for feature extraction and prediction can also be categorized under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
