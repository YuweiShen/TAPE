The proposed method, TransRec, involves embedding items into a \"transition space\" and modeling users as translation vectors, which suggests that it may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with large-scale sequential prediction, which could fall under the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves modeling complex interactions between users and items, which could also fall under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
