The algorithmic techniques used in the paper involve decomposing low-degree multilinear polynomials over Gaussian inputs, which is related to topics in data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses tools from probability theory, such as the central limit theorem and Stein's method, which are relevant to topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and probability (cs.PR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
