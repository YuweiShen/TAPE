The paper also involves combinatorial aspects of graph theory (cs.DM) and the analysis of graph structures (cs.DS). The study of graph embeddings and topological graph theory is also relevant (cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves the design and analysis of algorithms for graph drawing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
