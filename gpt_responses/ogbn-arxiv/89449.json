The paper also provides numerical experiments to show the performance of the developed methods on solving both random and real overdetermined linear systems. This suggests that the paper belongs to the cs.NA sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses random sketching to reduce the complexity of QR decomposition of the system matrix, which is a common technique used in machine learning for dimensionality reduction. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new method for solving overdetermined linear systems based on a sampling of matrix rows, which involves designing and analyzing algorithms for efficient sampling. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.DS sub-category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses random sketching to reduce the complexity of QR decomposition of the system matrix, which is a common technique used in information theory for signal processing and data compression. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.IT sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly involve social and information networks, but the Kaczmarz method has been used in network tom"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
