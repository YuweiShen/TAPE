The paper also discusses the potential for these explanations to mislead users, which is relevant to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding and generating misleading explanations, which involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential implications for critical domains such as healthcare and criminal justice, which falls under the category of computer and information security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
