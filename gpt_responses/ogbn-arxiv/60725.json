This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), deep learning (cs.DL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely categories as the paper deals with improving the accuracy of machine learning models on both tabular and image datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
