The use of quantum information processing and the analysis of quantum wiretap channels suggest a possible categorization under quantum information (cs.QI). The study of secrecy capacities and their analytic properties may also relate to statistical inference (cs.SI) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
