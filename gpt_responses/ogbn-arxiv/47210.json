The paper proposes a new distance metric and specifies two classes of robustness properties, which are used to build verifiably robust PDF malware classifiers. The paper also discusses the computational cost of unbounded attackers and the elimination of simple evasion attacks, which are relevant to the fields of computer security, machine learning, and software engineering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.SE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
