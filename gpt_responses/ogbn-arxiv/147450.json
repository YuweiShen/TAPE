The paper also involves complexity theory and NP-completeness, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as likely sub-categories. The use of gadgets and reductions also points towards cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Graph Theory) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
