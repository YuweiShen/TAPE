The paper also uses long short-term memory networks, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed models using standard evaluation metrics, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
