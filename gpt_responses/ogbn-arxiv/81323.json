This is a core topic in programming languages research.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper presents a formal model for coroutines and proves safety properties. This is a common topic in logic and formal methods research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Coroutines are a useful tool for managing control flow in event-driven programs, which are common in software engineering. The paper discusses the benefits of coroutines and their safety properties.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Coroutines can be used to manage concurrency and parallelism, which are important topics in distributed and parallel computing. The paper discusses the expressiveness of coroutines and their ability to handle async-await and event streams.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): Coroutines can be used to model and control systems, which is a topic in systems and control research. The paper discusses the expressiveness of coroutines and their ability to handle actors and symmetric coroutines."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
