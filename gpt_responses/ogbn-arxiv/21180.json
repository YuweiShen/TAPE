The focus on communication between agents suggests multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as another likely sub-category. The use of abstractions and the formulation of the language construction problem suggest machine learning (cs.LG) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the constructed languages in a multi-agent path-finding domain suggests systems and control (cs.SY) as a potential sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
