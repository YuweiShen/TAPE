The experiments are conducted on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and architectures (ResNet-18, All-CNN), which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of different regularization methods (weight decay, data augmentation) and learning rate schedules, which are relevant to neural network optimization (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on the early learning dynamics of deep networks suggests a potential connection to natural language processing (cs.CL), where similar concepts of early learning and transient behavior have been studied."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
