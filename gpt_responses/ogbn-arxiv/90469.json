The focus is on improving the accuracy of re-identification using auto-detected bounding boxes with background clutter. This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The use of reinforcement learning for attention selection also falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The evaluation of the proposed method on two benchmarks involves multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security (cs.CR) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
