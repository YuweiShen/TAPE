Game theory concepts are used to model the interactions and optimize the pricing strategy. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers the impact of wireless network congestion on the pricing scheme, and proposes a modified policy to ensure fairness among mobile users. This involves analyzing the network performance and designing pricing strategies that take into account the network conditions. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on the social data market, where the demand for mobile data is influenced by social network effects. The proposed pricing scheme exploits these effects to maximize revenue and user utilities. The paper also constructs a social graph using Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (ER) model and real dataset based social network for performance evaluation. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper deals with pricing optimization, which is a common problem in computational finance and economics. The proposed dynamic pricing scheme aims to maximize revenue in the long term, which involves modeling the market dynamics and optimizing the pricing strategy over time. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the proposed pricing scheme may have implications for security and privacy in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
