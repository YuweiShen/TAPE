The paper proposes a new method for clustering that uses high-order tensor similarity to complement the usual pairwise similarity. This method is shown to perform better than state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. Given the focus on machine learning and data analysis, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
