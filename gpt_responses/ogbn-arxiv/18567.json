Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also introduces a new sampling scheme that improves the estimation quality and reduces computation time, which is relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG and cs.AI). The paper evaluates the new sampling scheme by computing higher-order moments of standard normal distributions, which is a problem in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper considers extended object tracking based on many measurements per time step, which is a problem in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
