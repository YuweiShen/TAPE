Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel attribution method for RNNs, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML) interpretability. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of RNNs in various applications, such as speech recognition and image captioning, which are related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
