The use of Gaussian processes for moving object tracking and interpolation is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the theoretical grounding of batch state estimation, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a computational efficient method for calibration, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
