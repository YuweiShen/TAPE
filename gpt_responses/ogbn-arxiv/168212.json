This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The proposed scheme is compared with the bit-interleaved turbo coded modulation scheme used in WCDMA mobile communication systems. This indicates that the paper is related to communication systems.\n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with the design of a modulation scheme and optimal labeling rule, which involves signal processing techniques.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the performance of the proposed scheme in a mobile communication system, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the search space reduction technique used to efficiently find the optimal labeling rule, which involves algorithmic techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
