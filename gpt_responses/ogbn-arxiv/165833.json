The method combines reinforcement learning (cs.AI) with sampling-based planning (cs.SY) and uses feature-based and deep neural net policies (cs.LG) in continuous state and action spaces. The paper also includes evaluations in simulated environments (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
