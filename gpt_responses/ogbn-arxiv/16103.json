The problem involves finding a maximum cardinality set of crossing-free pairs of nucleotides in an RNA sequence. This problem has received much attention in computer science, and the current best algorithm for the problem still takes $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n^3}{\\log^2 (n)}\\right)$ time. The paper presents a conditional lower bound for the RNA folding problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), computational biology (cs.CG, q-bio.BM, q-bio.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
