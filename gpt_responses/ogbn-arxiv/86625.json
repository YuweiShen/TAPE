Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these fields heavily rely on deep learning architectures. Additionally, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be possible sub-categories as the paper discusses techniques for improving the trust and interpretability of virtual screening models in drug discovery."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
