This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a MU MIMO system, which involves multiple agents (users) communicating with a central agent (base station). This falls under the scope of multi-agent systems.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the impact of CFO on the performance of a MU MIMO system, which is a key aspect of wireless networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with CFO estimation/compensation, which is a signal processing technique used in wireless communication systems.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a MU MIMO system, which is a key technology for multimedia applications such as video streaming and virtual reality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
