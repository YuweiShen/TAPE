The paper introduces a two-level hierarchical approach that integrates model-free deep learning and model-based path planning. The paper uses a neural-network motion controller, called the intention-net, which is trained end-to-end to provide robust local navigation. The intention-net maps images from a single monocular camera and \"intentions\" directly to robot controls. The paper also uses a path planner that uses a crude map to compute a path from the robot's current location to the goal. The planned path provides intentions to the intention-net. Given the focus on robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
