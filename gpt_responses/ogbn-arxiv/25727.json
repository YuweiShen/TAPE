The proposed techniques are focused on improving memory efficiency, reducing latency, and enabling on-chip learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes hardware techniques for optimizing hyperdimensional computing, which can be considered an emerging technology in the field of artificial intelligence and signal processing. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes hardware optimizations for hyperdimensional computing, which is a specific hardware architecture used in various applications. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Hyperdimensional computing is inspired by the functioning of the brain, and the paper proposes techniques for improving its efficiency. Therefore, it is likely to be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing sub-category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes techniques for enabling on-chip learning and reducing latency, which are relevant to the systems and control sub-category. \n- cs.EM (Embedded Systems): The paper performs a design space exploration for a wearable biosignal processing application, which can be considered an embedded system. Therefore, it is likely to be relevant to the embedded systems sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
