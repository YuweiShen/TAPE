The paper also focuses on improving the usability of semi-autonomous robots, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of computer vision techniques to generate candidate grasps and reach-to-grasp trajectories in novel scenes suggests that the paper may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of a feedback controller to facilitate motion towards the most promising grasp suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
