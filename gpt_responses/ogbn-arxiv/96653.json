The use of function composition to capture the intuitive meaning of interestingness is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions case studies and examples, which could potentially fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
