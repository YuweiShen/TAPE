The proposed method involves using saliency maps to shed light on how the networks recognize images, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses how the proposed method simulates human recognition, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper uses two well-established deep CNN models, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
