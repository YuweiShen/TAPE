The use of improper signaling is a technique that has been explored in the context of signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the study involves analyzing the symbol error rate, which is a metric commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
