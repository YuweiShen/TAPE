The paper focuses on improving the generalizability of sound event detection models across heterogeneous acoustic environments. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing). Additionally, the paper uses several machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), per-channel energy normalization (PCEN), and context-adaptive neural network (CA-NN) layer. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
