Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it discusses efficient implementations of interior-point algorithms. The paper may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as linear programming is often used in machine learning applications. The Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category may also be relevant as interior-point algorithms can be parallelized for faster computation. Finally, the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses the implementation of numerical algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
