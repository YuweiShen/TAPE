The paper also presents applications of the proposed structure, such as maintaining nearest neighbors and answering reverse nearest neighbor queries, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and spatial indexing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the performance of the proposed structure, which can be related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
