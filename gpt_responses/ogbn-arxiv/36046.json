Additionally, the use of feature selection approaches and the na\\\"\"ive Bayes classifier suggest that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on biomedical domain and the use of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts could also make it relevant to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
