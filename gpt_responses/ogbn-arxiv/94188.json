The paper also discusses the parallelization of the algorithm, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC) and graph theory (cs.GT). The use of resampling oracles and the Lovasz Local Lemma suggests a connection to probabilistic methods (cs.PR) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's focus on a specific condition for an arbitrary rule to work suggests a connection to algorithm design and analysis (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
