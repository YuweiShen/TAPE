This problem is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also presents a non-trivial upper bound on the amount of information that can be communicated, which involves analyzing the structure of the channel and the behavior of the jammer. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
