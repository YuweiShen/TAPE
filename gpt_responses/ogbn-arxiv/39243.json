It focuses on the robustness of these estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions or arbitrary corruptions. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), statistics (cs.ST), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
