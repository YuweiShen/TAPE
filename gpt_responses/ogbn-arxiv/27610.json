The paper also discusses the sensitivity of neural networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the security implications of adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new training technique, which is related to neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
