This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the potential use of this method in mission-critical applications, which could be relevant to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the method involves adjusting the coverage of the classifier, which could relate to the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
