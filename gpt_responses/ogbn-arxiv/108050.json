The paper also discusses the use of PCA compression and discriminative dimensionality reduction, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper mentions retraining the neural network on a dataset, which is a common technique in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
