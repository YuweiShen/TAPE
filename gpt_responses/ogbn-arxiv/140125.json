The paper discusses the development of a question classification system using machine learning techniques for the Bengali language. This falls under the domain of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are covered by the sub-categories cs.CL and cs.IR. The use of machine learning algorithms for classification also falls under the sub-categories cs.AI and cs.LG. Finally, the comparison of performance and computational complexity of different approaches falls under the sub-category cs.CC, which deals with computational complexity and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
