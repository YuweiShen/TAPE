Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the drawbacks of the standard method and proposes a new method to improve it, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the importance of modeling target function nonlinearity, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of activation functions in modeling, which is relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
