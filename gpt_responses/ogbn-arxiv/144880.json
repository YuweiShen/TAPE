Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new approach for learning blocking schemes, which involves exploring a multi-dimensional space and identifying scheme skylines. This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the challenge of efficiently exploring a large space, which is a common problem in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
