The paper also mentions the challenges of handling big data and information overflow, which could be related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of computer vision tools as decision support could also fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper mentions the use of UAVs, which could be related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the need for humans to be alert in detecting sudden situations, which could be related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
