The focus on slow fading channels and the proposed diversity interleaver and diversity polar code designs suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed designs through simulations may also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
