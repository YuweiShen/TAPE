This suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of cryptography (cs.CR), distributed computing (cs.DC), or distributed systems (cs.Distributed). Additionally, the protocol has logarithmic time and polylogarithmic network complexity, which could also place it in the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper tests the protocol on a large-scale deployment using AWS instances, which could also suggest the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
