The paper provides positive answers to key computational questions related to maximum entropy distributions, and shows how the results can be applied to derive several old and new results in a unified manner. The paper involves techniques from convex analysis, polyhedral geometry, and continuous optimization, which are commonly used in the areas of information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
