This involves the use of statistical quality information and local CSIT at different transmitters (TXs) to optimize the precoding design. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
