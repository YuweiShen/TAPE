The focus on learning optimal control in complex environments suggests robotics (cs.RO) as another likely sub-category. The use of simulated environments and the creation of a new environment for testing also suggests systems and control (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for image processing in the simulated environment suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a potential sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
