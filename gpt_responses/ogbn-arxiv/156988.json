The use of global constraints also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the development of efficient propagators, which is a topic in constraint programming (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the identification of tractable classes of constraint problems, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
