The problem is also related to graph theory (cs.DM), as it includes the embeddability problem of a graph on a surface and the topological crossing number of a graph. The paper also discusses algorithms and complexity, which are topics in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the algorithm by Mohar, which is related to graph theory and topology (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
