The paper uses reduction techniques and the Exponential Time Hypothesis to prove lower bounds on the running time of algorithms for this problem. This makes it likely that the paper would be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.LG (Machine Learning), or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
