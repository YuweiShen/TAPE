The proposed framework uses Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and dynamic shape coding, which are techniques commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a dataset consisting of images of different scripts, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
