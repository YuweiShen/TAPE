The paper proposes three general reading strategies inspired by cognitive science and applies them to a pre-trained language model to improve its performance on multiple-choice machine reading comprehension tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which specifically deals with NLP and its applications. The paper also involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves unsupervised learning, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
