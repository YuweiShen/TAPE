Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also utilizes an AutoML scheme to optimize the CNN architecture, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with text recognition, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques such as CNN and LSTM suggests that the paper may also belong to the deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
