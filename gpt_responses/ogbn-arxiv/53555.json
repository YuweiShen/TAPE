The use of recurrent neural networks and attentional models suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. The application of policy gradient reinforcement learning suggests relevance to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category. Finally, the mention of character-level datasets suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) category, which often deals with image segmentation and recognition at the character level."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
