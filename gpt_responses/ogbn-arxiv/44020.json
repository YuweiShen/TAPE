Additionally, the paper introduces a novel attention mechanism, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of sub-networks and capacity allocation is also related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on image datasets, which could also place it in the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
