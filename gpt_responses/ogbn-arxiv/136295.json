The use of logarithmic space algorithms also suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the application of the results to arithmetical formulas suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
