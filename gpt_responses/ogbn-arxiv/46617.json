The paper proposes a Monte Carlo approach for efficient classifier chains, which is a method used in machine learning for multi-label classification, a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the theoretical and empirical study of payoff functions, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper compares its proposed method with other related methods, which is a common practice in computational linguistics (cs.CL).
