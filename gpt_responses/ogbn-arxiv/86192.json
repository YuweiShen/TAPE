This involves developing new plan representations and capabilities for risk-sensitive and goal-directed planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints. These topics are closely related to robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), programming languages (cs.PL), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
