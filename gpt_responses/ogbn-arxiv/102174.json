The proposed classifier is evaluated on several datasets, including image classification datasets (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the benefits of probabilistic-driven classification techniques, which is related to data mining (cs.DM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
