The use of feedback to infer channel state and make rate adaptation decisions is also a common theme in these communities. The paper also considers the use of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to optimize rate adaptation decisions, which is a topic in control theory and systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a greedy algorithm for rate adaptation, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning and multimedia (cs.MM) communities. Finally, the paper considers the impact of quantization on the achievable goodput, which is a topic in performance analysis and modeling (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
