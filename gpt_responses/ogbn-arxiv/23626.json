The paper specifically focuses on improving the accuracy of the existing methods, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of loss functions and bounding box margin adjustment also indicates that it may belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
