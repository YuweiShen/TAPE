Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a novel Double Decoder RNN architecture, which involves training a model to predict the location of the split(s) and the constituent words, indicating a focus on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This suggests that the paper could also belong to categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
