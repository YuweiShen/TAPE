The paper also discusses abstract argumentation frameworks (ADFs), which are a popular tool in computational argumentation and natural language processing, falling under the categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents an algorithmic approach to the problem of realizability, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
