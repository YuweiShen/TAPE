The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning for existing large-scale benchmark datasets on traffic sign detection and classification, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of autonomous driving and smart cities also suggests that the paper may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as traffic signs are essential for ensuring road safety and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
