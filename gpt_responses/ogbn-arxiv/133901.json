The use of traversals over an abstract syntax tree suggests a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The application of the normalisation procedure to higher-order model checking suggests a connection to temporal logic (cs.TL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of game semantics to prove correctness suggests a connection to formal methods and verification (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
