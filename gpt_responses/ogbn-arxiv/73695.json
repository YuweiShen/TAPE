The paper proposes a new training scheme called differential training, which is designed to address this problem. Given the focus on neural networks and their training, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, since the paper deals with image classification tasks, it is also likely to be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper proposes a new loss function and discusses the security implications of adversarial examples, which could lead to classification under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, since the paper proposes a new training scheme, it could also be classified under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
