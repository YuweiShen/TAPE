Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses deep neural network models, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG and cs.AI). The paper also deals with semantic connections between words and labels, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR).
