The use of a spacetime graph representation and spectral clustering also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The mention of motion and appearance features suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the use of optical flow chains suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
