The paper also mentions the use of this language in domains such as space exploration (cs.RO) and manufacturing (cs.SY), which further supports the likelihood of these sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the modelling power of the language, which could be of interest to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
