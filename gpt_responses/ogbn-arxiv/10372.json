This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of polynomial approximations and tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time suggest a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and algorithms (cs.DS). The attribute-efficiency properties and smooth tradeoffs also suggest a connection to optimization and search algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
