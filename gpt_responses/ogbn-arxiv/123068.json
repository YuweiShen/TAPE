The use of the formation width function and its relation to the maximum length of a sequence that avoids a pattern suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT). The study of subsequences and pairwise distinct letters also points to a possible connection to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
