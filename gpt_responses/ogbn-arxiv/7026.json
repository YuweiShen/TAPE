It also discusses evasion and poisoning attacks, which are related to security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper uses theoretical analysis and draws connections to probability theory, which suggests the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses image classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV), and perturbations of data, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
