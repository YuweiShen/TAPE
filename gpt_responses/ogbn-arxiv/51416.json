The paper also discusses the languages that can be recognized by PEGs, which is related to formal languages (cs.FL). Additionally, the paper introduces a new computational model, the scaffolding automaton, which could be considered a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of PEGs in terms of their computational power, which could be considered a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
