The use of neural networks in object detection also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the generation of adversarial perturbations, which is a common topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of the MS COCO dataset suggests that it could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
