This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes the use of neural networks to classify different outage events directly from sensor data. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of neural networks to classify different outage events directly from sensor data. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes the use of neural networks to classify different outage events directly from sensor data. This falls under the domain of neural computing. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Although not the main focus of the paper, the real-time deployment of the classifier requires just a few matrix-vector products and simple vector operations, which can be considered as software engineering aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
