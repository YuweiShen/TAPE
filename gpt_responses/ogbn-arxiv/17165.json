The paper also discusses modifications to previous models for interaction systems, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The extension of the model to deal with uncertain environments is also relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of artificial motion data suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
