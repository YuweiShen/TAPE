The framework involves privacy considerations, which suggests a potential fit for the subcategories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of Gaussian differentials also suggests a potential fit for the subcategory of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the experiments involve evaluating the framework in two diverse domains, which suggests a potential fit for the subcategory of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
