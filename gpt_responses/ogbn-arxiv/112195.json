The paper also discusses the complexity of the decoding algorithms, which falls under the Network Information Theory (cs.NI) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) categories. Finally, the paper includes simulations and comparisons with other codes, which could fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
