The use of a hierarchy of Macbeath regions for efficient decomposition of a convex body suggests that it may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also mentions achieving near-optimal preprocessing time for approximate nearest neighbor searching, directional width queries, and polytope membership queries, which suggests that it may belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories.
