Additionally, it may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it specifically focuses on feedforward neural networks. The paper's heuristic approach may also fall under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves optimizing the performance of a learning algorithm. Furthermore, the use of neural networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
