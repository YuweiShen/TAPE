The paper specifically focuses on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse parsing, which is a type of discourse parsing that aims to identify the relationships between different parts of a text. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is the sub-category that covers NLP research. \n\nThe paper also mentions that it uses machine learning algorithms and feature sets to improve accuracy, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency and practicality of the system, which could make it relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper mentions that the system can process short documents such as news articles or essays in less than a second, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category, which covers research on efficient search and retrieval of information. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to the cs.CY (Computers and Society) sub-category, as it discusses the practical applications of the system and its potential impact on society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
