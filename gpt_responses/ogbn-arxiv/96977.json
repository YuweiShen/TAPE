Information theory is closely related to the capacity analysis of communication systems, and the paper focuses on maximizing the sum-capacity of the network. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless transmission strategies and proposes a low-cost channel estimator for the proposed IA-SSR framework. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the optimal power allocation policy for the proposed cooperative transmission scheme, which is a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless transmission strategies that can improve the capacity of multi-cell massive MIMO networks. This can be related to multimedia applications that require high data rates and reliable communication. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal with social or ethical issues related to computing, but it can indirectly impact society by improving the efficiency of wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
