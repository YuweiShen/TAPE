It may also belong to the augmented reality (cs.AR) sub-category as object detection is a key component of many AR applications. The paper also discusses the use of FPGA platforms for acceleration, which suggests it may belong to the embedded systems (cs.ET) or digital circuits (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the use of pipelined parallelism and dataflow-driven acceleration suggests it may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
