Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The use of various types of input features and the high performance achieved suggest that the model involves some level of machine learning, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of a neural network also suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on detecting irony in social media could also fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
