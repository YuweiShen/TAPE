The technique involves rendering polylines based on their slope, which could also be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper mentions linear time computation, which suggests a possible connection to Data Structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
