Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with autonomous driving, which falls under the category of robotics, hence cs.RO (Robotics) is the second most likely sub-category. The paper uses deep convolutional networks for training, which is a machine learning technique, hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the third most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with complex scene understanding, which is a problem in artificial intelligence, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the fourth most likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with automatically labeling a large-scale dataset, which involves natural language processing techniques, hence cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the fifth most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
