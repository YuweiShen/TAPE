This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper presents a data structure and query algorithm, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the computation of perimeter and area, which involves numerical methods and scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the paper deals with the computation of convex hulls, which is a topic in graph theory and combinatorics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
