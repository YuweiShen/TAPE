The paper uses supervised learning to train the policy to mimic a \"teacher\" algorithm and provides convergence guarantees. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
