The use of relays and interference alignment also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the network and communication sub-categories (cs.NI, cs.SY). Finally, the numerical examples and comparison with existing techniques may also indicate a potential fit for the multimedia sub-category (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
