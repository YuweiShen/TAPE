This topic is closely related to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), data mining (cs.DM), and software engineering (cs.SE). Given the focus on machine learning and GP models, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. However, the use of pruning techniques and the emphasis on improving generalization ability suggest that cs.DM and cs.NE are also relevant. Finally, the mention of computational burden and the need for efficient strategies may indicate a connection to cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
