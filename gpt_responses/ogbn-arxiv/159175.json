The paper also discusses the security of the proposed protocol, making it highly likely to belong to this category.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with secure multi-party computation (MPC), which involves distributed computing. The use of OT in MPC also makes it likely to belong to this category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper involves the use of information theory concepts such as entropy and mutual information in the analysis of the proposed protocol.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the communication and computation complexity of OT and OT extension protocols, making it likely to belong to this category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new OT extension protocol, which involves the design and analysis of algorithms for efficient computation of OTs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
