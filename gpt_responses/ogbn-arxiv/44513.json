The proposed method involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel combination strategy for fusing low-level features, which involves making decisions based on consensus, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
