The network architecture involves a fully convolutional regression network with a global pooling layer, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning for image analysis (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of localization maps, which is a technique used in object detection and localization (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on MRI images, which is a common application of computer vision in medical imaging (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of their method with other approaches, which is a common practice in multimedia analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
