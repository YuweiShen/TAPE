The paper focuses on optimistic strategies, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning. The paper proposes a new algorithm, KL-UCRL, which is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This algorithm is compared to the UCRL2 algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm in the field. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
