The paper introduces a new operational semantics for CHR and a formal meta-language for reasoning about abstract states and derivations. These topics are closely related to programming languages (cs.PL), logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), software engineering (cs.SE), and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
