Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also involves optimization techniques, which makes cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible category. The paper also involves image processing techniques, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) another possible category.
