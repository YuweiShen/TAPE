The paper also discusses the use of state-of-the-art algorithms and feature analysis, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The development of a Struck-scale method for handling objects of varying shape and scale is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of infrared imaging for bird tracking is related to image processing (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
