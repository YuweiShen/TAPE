The problem involves interval graphs, which are a type of geometric graphs, so it may also belong to the sub-category of \"Computational Geometry\" (cs.CG). The paper also involves kernelization, which is a technique used in parameterized complexity, so it may belong to the sub-category of \"Discrete Mathematics\" (cs.DM).
