The paper focuses on developing new monitoring and operational planning tools for stability and sustainability in distribution grids, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The proposed approach also involves data mining and physical understanding, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), which may require optimization and control techniques (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of traditional regression methods, which may involve computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
