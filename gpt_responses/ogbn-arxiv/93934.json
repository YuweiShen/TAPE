The paper also introduces a new RL framework, which involves optimizing policies while following defined constraints, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the challenges of accurate sensing and actuation, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results using vision-based sensing, which could fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
