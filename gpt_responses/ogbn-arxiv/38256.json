The problem is addressed using a combination of low-level controllers and planners into discrete action trajectories, which can be represented using a linear contextual bandit setting. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper deals with visual and physical environments, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category. Finally, the paper deals with a robot-assisted feeding system, which suggests that it may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
