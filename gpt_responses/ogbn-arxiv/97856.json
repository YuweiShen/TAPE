Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of large Transformer-based models, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML). Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper proposes a new self-supervised objective for pre-training the models, which involves generating an extractive summary from the input document. This involves understanding the relevance and importance of different sentences in the document, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. The paper also involves evaluation of the model's performance on different datasets, which falls under the category of information retrieval (IR). Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves training the model using a large corpus of text, which involves optimization and training of neural networks, falling under the category of neural networks (NE). Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
