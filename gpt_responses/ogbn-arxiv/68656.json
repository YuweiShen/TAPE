However, the concept of entropy power can be applied to network analysis, making this sub-category a possibility. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures, which is not directly related to the paper. However, the paper involves mathematical analysis, which is a common theme in this sub-category. \n5. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper involves mathematical analysis and the derivation of expressions, which may involve the use of mathematical software.
