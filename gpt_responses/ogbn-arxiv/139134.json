This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The approach also involves maximizing the influence of geo-distinctive visual elements, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The use of large-scale datasets and machine learning techniques for location estimation also suggests a possible connection to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the approach involves the use of specific representations for query images, which suggests a possible connection to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
