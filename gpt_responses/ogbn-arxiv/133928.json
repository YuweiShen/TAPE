The paper presents a result that holds for random measurements sampled from any subgaussian distribution, without any small-ball conditions. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
