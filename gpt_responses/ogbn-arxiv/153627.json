The paper also discusses the use of differential evolution, which is a type of optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of a publicly available benchmark dataset for evaluation purposes, which falls under the category of software engineering. Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is also a likely category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of load signatures and feature spaces, which falls under the category of signal processing. Therefore, cs.SD (Signal Processing) is also a likely category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of load signatures for energy disaggregation, which falls under the category of energy and power systems.
