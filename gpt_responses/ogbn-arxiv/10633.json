The problem also involves designing efficient data structures, which suggests cs.DS as another likely category. The problem generalizes several well-studied computational problems, including Nearest Neighbor Search, which suggests cs.CG as a possible category. Finally, the paper includes theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, which suggests cs.LG as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
