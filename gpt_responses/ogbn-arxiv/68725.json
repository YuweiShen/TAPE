This is a networking problem and falls under the scope of cs.NI. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the trade-off between the throughput achievable by secondary users and the interference generated by their activity to primary users. This is an information-theoretic problem and falls under the scope of cs.IT. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions millimeter wave networks, which are used for high-speed multimedia applications. The proposed approach takes into account the irregular structure of interference patterns arising from path loss, shadowing, and blockages, which are especially relevant in millimeter wave networks. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a hierarchical scheme for spectrum sensing, which involves the aggregation of local state estimates to obtain aggregate state information at multiple scales. This is a control problem and falls under the scope of cs.SY. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not explicitly discuss security or cryptography, but these topics are relevant in cognitive wireless networks, where secondary users need to ensure that their activity does not interfere with primary users. Therefore, cs.CR is a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
