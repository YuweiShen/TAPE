This falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the system uses RGB-D images to extract features from the scene, which is a computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of deep learning models for prediction also falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the accuracy and performance of the model, which is a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
