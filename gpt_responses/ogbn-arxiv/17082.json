It also involves coding theory, as the files are encoded using MDS codes (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new protocol for PIR, which involves communication between servers, making it relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions repair bandwidth, which is a topic in network coding (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses implementation over the binary field, which is a topic in computer systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
