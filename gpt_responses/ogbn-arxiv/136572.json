This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a time-switching co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system consisting of multiple multi-antenna access points which serve multiple single antenna users. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework to design jointly the Pareto optimal beamforming vector and the TS ratio for each receiver. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the trade-off between harvested energy and information data rate objectives and shows the effect of optimizing the precoding strategy and TS ratio on this trade-off. This falls under the scope of multimedia. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a system consisting of multiple multi-antenna access points which serve multiple single antenna users. This falls under the scope of multi-agent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
