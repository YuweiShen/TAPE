The technique involves using spectral methods to learn a model, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of entropy to measure the accuracy of the learned model, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
