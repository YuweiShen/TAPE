The paper also discusses the use of these sketches for organizing a knowledge graph, which is related to information retrieval and semantic web (cs.IR, cs.SW). However, the focus of the paper is on deep learning, so the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
