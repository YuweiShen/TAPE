Therefore, cs.IR and cs.SI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves developing new algorithms for efficient computation and sampling, which are related to data structures (DS) and databases (DB). Additionally, the paper deals with large-scale networks, which are often studied in the field of social computing (SOC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
