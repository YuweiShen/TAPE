Additionally, the use of search engines and web resources suggests a connection to web science (cs.WS) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The paper also involves analyzing and comparing data, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze web pages could place this paper in the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
