This involves the use of neural networks and distance fields, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of singular value decomposition, which is a common technique in linear algebra and geometry (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper involves unsupervised learning, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
