This indicates the use of machine learning techniques. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the classification of hyperspectral images, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach for hyperspectral image classification, which can be seen as an application of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with hyperspectral images, which can be seen as a form of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
