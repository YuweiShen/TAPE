The use of cloud technologies and algorithms for processing data volumes suggests a connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and cloud computing (cs.CC). The implementation of mathematical models for accurate processing of data volumes suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the proposed system architecture allows developers and engineers not specialized in robotic implementation environments to utilize generic robotic algorithms and services off-the-shelf, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
