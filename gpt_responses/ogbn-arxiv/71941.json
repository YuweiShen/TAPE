The paper proposes a general framework for ensuring good angular coverage and applies it to a variety of problems, including sensor placement on the plane and in the presence of additional distance or visibility constraints. This suggests that the paper could be classified under several sub-categories, including computational geometry (cs.CG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), robotics (cs.RO), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
