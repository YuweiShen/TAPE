The use of deep learning models for object detection also suggests that the paper could fall under the subcategories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach also involves incremental learning, which could fall under the subcategory of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses leveraging class imbalances, which could also fall under the subcategory of natural language processing (cs.CL) if the imbalances are related to text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
