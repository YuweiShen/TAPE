The system also uses computer vision techniques such as image processing and object detection (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques to build a persistent map of the environment (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the system is designed to work in real-world scenarios, which involves control systems and sensors (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
