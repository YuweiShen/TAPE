This involves the use of sensors to collect mobile accelerometer and gyroscope data during movements, which is then annotated and used to train the automated classifier. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by human-computer interaction (cs.HC), machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
