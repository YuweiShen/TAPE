The paper also involves machine learning techniques for disambiguation, which falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of heuristics and language-independent clues suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.LG (Learning) sub-category. The visualisation aspect of the paper may also make it relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category, as neural networks are often used for data visualisation tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
