The proposed method utilizes optical flow, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) fields. The paper also mentions a dual judgment mechanism, which involves making decisions based on adaptive intervals and thresholds, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
