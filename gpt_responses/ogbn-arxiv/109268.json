The paper also discusses the use of reward models, which can be seen as a form of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with language-like instructions. The use of spatial relations and underspecified abstract arrangements suggests that the paper may also fall under robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
