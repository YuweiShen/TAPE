This methodology involves considering the whole evaluated solutions of a neutral network and escaping from plateaus based on the evolvability of solutions. These concepts are closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the exploration-exploitation trade-off, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which involve implementing the proposed methodology, analyzing the impact of different parameters, and comparing the results to other methods. This experimental approach is typical of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
