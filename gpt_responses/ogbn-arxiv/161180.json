This topic falls under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of adaptive algorithms to adjust bid prices based on prior performance, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and potentially artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the distribution of budget over time, which could fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
