This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the IEEE 802.11ay amendment for Wireless LANs, which is a networking standard. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with beamforming training in mmWave communications, which is often used for multimedia applications such as high-definition video streaming. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for channel selection and beamforming training, which can be seen as a control problem. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): While not directly related to natural language processing, the paper does involve the use of sparse channel information, which could be seen as a form of data compression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
