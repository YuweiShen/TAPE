It proposes a vision system that integrates different vision modules, a knowledge base and a query engine to perform joint video and query parsing. The paper also provides a benchmark dataset and a toolkit for ontology guided story-line query generation. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
