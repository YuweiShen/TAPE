The paper presents new algorithms for the ordinal Matroid Secretary Problem (MSP), which is a well-studied problem in the area of online algorithms and decision theory. The paper also introduces new techniques for designing algorithms with strong probability-competitive ratios, which are relevant to several other problems in computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
