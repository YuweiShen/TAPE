The use of geometric measure theory and discrete exterior calculus suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the use of Whitney forms and multilabeling approaches suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
