Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) for feature selection and engineering, which falls under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of home videos for screening suggests the involvement of computer vision techniques, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves human-computer interaction (HCI) as it aims to create a low-cost, quick, and easy to apply autism screening tool, which falls under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Overall, the paper involves multiple sub-categories, but the most likely ones are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.HC, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
