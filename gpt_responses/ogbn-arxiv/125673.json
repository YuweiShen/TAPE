The algorithm uses convex relaxations based on the sum-of-squares method, which is a common technique in optimization and theoretical computer science. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the breakdown of natural tensor-unfolding-based spectral relaxations and proposes a new algorithm that exploits additional problem structure. This suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SD (Systems and Control) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper analyzes the performance of the algorithm and shows that improving the guarantees would require new techniques or might even be intractable, which is a common theme in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
