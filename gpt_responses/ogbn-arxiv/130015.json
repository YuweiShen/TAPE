Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses neural networks for training the semantic parser, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another likely category. The paper also discusses the types of representations useful for semantic parsing, which could fall under cs.LG (Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions using annotated logical forms or their denotations for training, which could involve computer vision techniques and thus suggest cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
