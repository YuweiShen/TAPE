The focus on cognitive modeling and understanding human decision-making suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the mention of a dataset and data-driven approach suggests a connection to cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
