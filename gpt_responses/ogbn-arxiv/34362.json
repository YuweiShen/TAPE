The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) also suggests that it may fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the modeling of image and distortion maps using statistical distributions, which could fall under graphics (cs.GR) or information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of support vector regression (SVR) for quality score estimation suggests that it may also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
