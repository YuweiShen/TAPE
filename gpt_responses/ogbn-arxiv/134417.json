The paper discusses the behavior of networks with different architectures and activation functions, and their stability under perturbations. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and data structures (cs.DS) as the paper deals with the mathematical and computational aspects of training deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
