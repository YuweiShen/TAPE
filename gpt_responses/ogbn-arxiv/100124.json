Additionally, the paper proposes profit-sharing schemes and analyzes the properties of resulting states, which are common approaches in game theory. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with the behavior of agents in a multiagent system, which is a common topic in AI research. \n\nThe Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category is also likely as the paper specifically studies the dynamics of coalition formation in multiagent systems. \n\nThe Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DS) sub-category may be relevant as the paper analyzes the properties of states resulting from the myopic behavior of agents, which can be seen as a distributed computing problem. \n\nFinally, the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category may be relevant as the paper studies the behavior of agents in a networked environment where they form coalitions and share profits."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
