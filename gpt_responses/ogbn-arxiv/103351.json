This topic is closely related to several subfields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and augmented reality (cs.AR). However, given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.AR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
