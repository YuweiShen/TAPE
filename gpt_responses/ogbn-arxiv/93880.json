It also discusses the trade-off between stability and expressibility in recurrent models, which is a common topic in machine learning research. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with recurrent neural networks and proposes a new method for training them. \n\nThe paper's focus on stability analysis of non-linear systems suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nThe use of recurrent neural networks in various applications, such as natural language processing and image captioning, suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
