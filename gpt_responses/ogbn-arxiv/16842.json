This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computer Science focused on Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of microcontroller devices, which are commonly used in Embedded Systems (cs.EM). The paper also discusses the implementation of the control software, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of a tool to implement the algorithm, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper mentions safety and liveness requirements for the closed loop system, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
