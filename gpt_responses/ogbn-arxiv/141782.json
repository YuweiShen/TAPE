Therefore, cs.DB and cs.LO are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces notions of ordinal containment and equivalence of ranked relations, which are related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, hence cs.AI is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the relationship to monotone query evaluation and alternative rank-aware approaches, which are related to data structures and algorithms, hence cs.DS and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
