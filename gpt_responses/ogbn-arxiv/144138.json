The paper proposes a new method called Quantization-aware Knowledge Distillation (QKD) that combines quantization and knowledge distillation to achieve this goal. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves training deep neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
