The paper specifically focuses on the use of Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Gaussian fitting to approximate the posterior distribution over neural network weights. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
