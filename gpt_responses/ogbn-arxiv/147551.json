The use of deep reinforcement learning to train action policies is a popular approach in robotics, and hence, the paper is likely to belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The paper also deals with the challenges of reward sparsity, temporal complexities, and high-dimensionality of sensorimotor spaces, which are common in reinforcement learning problems. Therefore, the paper is also likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper proposes a policy that maps height-map image observations to motor commands, which involves the use of computer vision techniques. Hence, the paper is also likely to belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. The paper also deals with the problem of domain randomization to improve the versatility of training samples, which is a common technique in control systems. Therefore, the paper is also likely to belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to acquire multifaceted navigation skills by learning and exploiting a number of manageable navigation behaviors, which involves the use of machine learning techniques. Hence, the paper is also likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
