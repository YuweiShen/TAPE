It also mentions the central limit theorem and the fact that the distribution of noise in numerous engineering systems is well captured by the Gaussian distribution. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SI), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
