This involves learning policies for scheduling learning rates during optimization, with the goal of minimizing training time while achieving a certain performance goal. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also experiments on a standard benchmark dataset in computer vision (MNIST), suggesting cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as another likely sub-category. Finally, the use of reinforcement learning to optimize a DNN can also be seen as a control problem, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
