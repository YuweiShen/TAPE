The use of different transmission energies for the codeword bits is a technique that can be applied in communication networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of Monte Carlo simulations, which is a common method in computer science (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
