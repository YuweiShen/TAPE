It also involves the design of a new scheme for transmitting information in wireless networks, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and control engineering (cs.SY). The use of quantization and mapping techniques suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
