This involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of CNNs and feature extraction is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
