Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for synthesis, which is a popular topic in machine learning (ML), making cs.SD (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The workflow presented in the paper involves modern build automation and cloud-hosted infrastructure, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper promotes the use of open data, which could also make cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
