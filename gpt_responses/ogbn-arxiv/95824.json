This topic falls under the category of computer networks (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT), as well as systems and control (cs.SY) due to the scheduling aspect of TWT. The paper also mentions the potential benefits of TWT for multiuser transmissions and spatial reuse, which could relate to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) in terms of ensuring efficient and secure data transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
