The use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the focus on the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the system model suggest that the paper may also be relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of different estimation theoretic problems indicates that the paper may also be of interest to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
