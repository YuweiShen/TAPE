Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Signal Processing) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the system-level aspects of radar imaging, such as the number of transmit and receive antennas, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of convex optimization techniques, which is a common tool in the field of cs.SP (Statistical Signal Processing). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in image processing, which falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
