This suggests a focus on programming languages and compilers.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): WebAssembly is a low-level virtual machine architecture, and the paper deals with optimizing its bytecode. This suggests a possible fit with the cs.AR sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses challenges faced in superoptimization of WebAssembly, which could be seen as a software engineering problem.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): While not a primary focus of the paper, the use of superoptimization could potentially have implications for security and cryptography in WebAssembly.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimizing low-level bytecode, which could be seen as a systems and control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
