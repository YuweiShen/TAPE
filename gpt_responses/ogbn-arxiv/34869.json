Therefore, cs.AI and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories. The use of state-of-the-art industrial networks also suggests a focus on computer vision (CV) applications, which makes cs.CV a likely sub-category as well. The mention of hardware platforms and system optimization suggests a focus on embedded systems and control (cs.SY), while the mention of industrial software stack suggests a focus on augmented reality (AR) applications, making cs.AR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
