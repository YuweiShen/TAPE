Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm, which involves training the network on real rainy images without their clean counterparts. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.GR (Graphics). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on synthetic and real data, indicating that it may also belong to the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
