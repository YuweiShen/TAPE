This involves information theory (cs.IT) as well as networking (cs.NI) concepts. The paper also discusses security against computational brute-force attacks (cs.CR) and considers two different scenarios for recovering missing packets - centralized and decentralized (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for decentralized retransmission using network coding, which involves system and control theory (cs.SY) concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
