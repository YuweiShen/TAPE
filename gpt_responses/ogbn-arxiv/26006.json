The use of semantic priors indicates a focus on incorporating prior knowledge into the detection process, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence research. The evaluation of the proposed framework on two datasets suggests a focus on machine learning and multimedia applications. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
