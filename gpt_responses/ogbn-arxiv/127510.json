Additionally, the paper discusses the classification of network attacks, which is related to network infrastructure (cs.NI). The proposed taxonomy also involves the use of machine learning techniques for accurate intrusion detection, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of targeted datasets for intrusion detection, which is related to the field of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper proposes a consistent way of classifying network attacks, which is related to the field of information systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
