This makes it likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories. The paper also discusses performance gains on x86_64 CPUs, which suggests it could belong to the cs.SC (Scientific Computing) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-categories. Finally, the implementation is done in the M4RI library, which is a library for fast linear algebra over GF(2), making it likely to belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
