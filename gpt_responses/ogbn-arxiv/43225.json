The paper proposes modifications to existing algorithms for random sampling and iterative refinement of the approximation, which are relevant to the subfield of numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime, which are relevant to the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG), data science (cs.DS), and scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the paper uses real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, which is relevant to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
