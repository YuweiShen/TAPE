The paper deals with question classification using machine learning techniques, which falls under the domain of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifiers also suggests the involvement of deep learning and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
