The proposed method is applied to classification of real-world data-sets and semantic segmentation of biomedical images, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the generalization bounds of the proposed approach, which is a topic that falls under the category of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses empirical measures in the feature space, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
