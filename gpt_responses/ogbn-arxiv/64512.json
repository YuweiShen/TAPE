The paper also discusses the use of RF beamforming vectors taken from a quantized codebook, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SY) and millimeter wave technology (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity algorithm for the design of the hybrid precoders, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
