This involves introducing novel perturbation-injection modules and an alternating back-propagation training algorithm. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with adversarial attacks and defense, it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
