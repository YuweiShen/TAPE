The paper also focuses on the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted models, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification, which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the limitations of learning-based strategies, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the practicality of model extraction attacks against production-grade systems, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
