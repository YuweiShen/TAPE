It may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves 3D reconstruction. The use of energy minimization and graph cuts suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the inclusion of visibility reasoning suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
