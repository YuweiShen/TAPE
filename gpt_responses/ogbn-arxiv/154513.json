Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of loss recovery on QoS, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The proposed algorithms involve monitoring and tuning TCP sending buffer growth mechanism, which could fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the improvement in bandwidth efficiency, which could fall under the category of performance (cs.PF). Finally, the paper proposes a novel opportunistic retransmission algorithm, which could fall under the category of robotics and automation (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
