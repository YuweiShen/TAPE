The authors evaluate the optimizers on standard datasets and architectures, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of hyperparameter tuning, which is a common theme in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) since the authors mention using automatic hyperparameter search."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
