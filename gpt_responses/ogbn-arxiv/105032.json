The algorithm incorporates the Rao-Blackwell theorem and Control Variates to reduce the variance of the policy gradient estimators. The paper also utilizes the second-order advantage information and a wide & deep architecture to capture the quadratic information explicitly and efficiently. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also deals with control tasks, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper utilizes a deep architecture, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
