This problem falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR), which is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.AI) and the design of features based on a measurement study (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with network infrastructures (cs.NI) and evaluates the efficiency of the proposed models (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
