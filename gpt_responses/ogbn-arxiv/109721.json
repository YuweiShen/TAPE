The main focus of the paper is on developing a new method for policy search, which falls under the category of reinforcement learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of numerical values of rewards to condition policies, which is related to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. Finally, the paper's approach can be applied to control systems (cs.SY). \n\nOverall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.CV, and cs.SY, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
