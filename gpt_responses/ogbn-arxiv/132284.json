Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves linear algebra and statistical theories, indicating a possible connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions state-of-the-art Neural Network models, suggesting a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Transformer-big models, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks, indicating a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
