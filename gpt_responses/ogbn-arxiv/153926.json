This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper formulates the problem of pricing and determining the fraction of infrastructure to be sold as a Cournot oligopoly market. This involves game theory and falls under the domain of computer science and game theory.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper analyzes the trade-off between increasing the transmit power of a BS and the intensity of BSs owned by the buyer MNO required to achieve a given quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of the SINR coverage probability. This involves information theory and falls under the domain of cs.IT.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with multiple seller MNOs and a single buyer MNO, which can be modeled as a social network. The analysis of the market and the optimization of the seller MNO's BS intensity can also be seen as a social network problem.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper formulates a market for infrastructure sharing"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
