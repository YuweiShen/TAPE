The paper also discusses the challenges of sharing patient data across institutions, which relates to data privacy and security (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper proposes heuristics for transferring weights between models, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed heuristics on three different image collections, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
