It also involves the use of deep neural networks to map high-dimensional state spaces to abstract tabular environments. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the development of an agent that can learn to maximize reward in complex tasks. \n\nThe use of visual inputs in the state space suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). \n\nThe tasks of 3D navigation and adapting to sudden changes in rewards or transition probabilities suggest that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
