The paper uses techniques such as graph-mining, multi-dimensional scaling, spreading activation, neural networks, and emotion categorization model to construct the sentiment lexicon. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper deals with sentiment analysis, which is a sub-field of information retrieval (IR), so it could also belong to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of affective common-sense knowledge, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which deals with the analysis of social networks and their impact on information dissemination and sentiment analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
