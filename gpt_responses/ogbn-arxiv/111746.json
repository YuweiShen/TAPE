Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the training of neural networks, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The proposed method involves explicit training of RNNs, which can be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with text recognition, which falls under the category of cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper discusses the use of memory maps, which can be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
