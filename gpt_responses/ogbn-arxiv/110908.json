The paper also mentions Linear Logic and proof-nets, which are topics in logic and theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses graph theory and partial permutations, which are topics in discrete mathematics, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions gluing and reduction, which are topics in topology and category theory, making cs.TL (Topology) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses confluence, which is a topic in formal verification, making cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
