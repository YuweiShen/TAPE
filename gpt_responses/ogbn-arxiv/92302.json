The proposed model is a face-focused cross-stream network that uses both face and body cues for deception detection. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with analyzing human-centric videos and proposes a multimodal learning approach that fuses face and body cues. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for deception detection and addresses the problem of limited training data by using meta learning and adversarial learning. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with analyzing human behavior in videos and proposes a model that can detect deception. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a model that can recognize emotions from user-generated videos, which is a form of information retrieval from multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
