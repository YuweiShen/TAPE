The paper describes a hybrid system that uses two different unsupervised approaches for WSD. The first approach involves selecting senses based on mutual information proximity, which is a common technique used in NLP and information retrieval (IR). The second approach involves analyzing examples of use in the glosses of the senses to infer simple syntactic patterns, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper uses unsupervised approaches, it may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
