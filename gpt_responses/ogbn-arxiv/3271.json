This involves modeling session sequences as graph-structured data and using GNNs to capture complex transitions of items. This approach falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves predicting user actions based on anonymous sessions. It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with textual data. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI) as it deals with recommendation systems and modeling complex transitions of items in sessions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
