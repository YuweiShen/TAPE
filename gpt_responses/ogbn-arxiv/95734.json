This falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses formalizing a notion of behavioral approximation, which relates to logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper addresses challenges unique to untyped, dynamic programming, which relates to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses soundness of the approach, which relates to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
