Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of multi-scale schemes and geometric invariance, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of deep learning models for feature extraction and representation is also relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
