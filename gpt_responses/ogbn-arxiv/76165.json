The focus is on the challenges of translating from polysynthetic to fusional languages, which falls under the category of cross-lingual NLP. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the limited amount of parallel text available, which is a common problem in low-resource NLP, and thus, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the identification of morpheme types that are commonly hard to align or ignored in the translation process, which could be addressed using neural networks or other optimization techniques, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves a qualitative analysis of the translation process, which could be considered a form of data science, making cs.SD (Sound) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
