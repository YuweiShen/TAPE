The specific focus on Wi-Fi steganography suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of detection systems and algorithms, which could relate to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the state of the art in hiding techniques, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) methods for analyzing images and videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
