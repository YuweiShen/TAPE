The proposed method involves using a high-level table to guide a planner, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions simulations and experiments, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the proposed method involves improving running time and trajectory quality, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
