It also involves the use of antennas and channel state information, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper proposes a practical approach using reconfigurable antennas, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
