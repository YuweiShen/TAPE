This methodology has been widely studied in the artificial intelligence community and has recently been connected to nonlocal correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics. The paper focuses on ruling out latent homophily as a manifestation of prior shared interest leading to the observed patternedness in the coauthor network. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.SD (Systems and Control), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
