This falls under the domain of social and economic implications of computing, making cs.CY a likely category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes bank card payments and ATM cash withdrawals to map and quantify the impact of natural disasters on communities. This involves studying social and economic networks and their behavior during and after disasters, making cs.SI a possible category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper may involve issues related to data privacy and security, as it deals with sensitive financial transaction data. This makes cs.CR a possible category.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper may involve developing software tools and algorithms to process and analyze big economic transaction data. This makes cs.SD a possible category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with big economic transaction data and involves developing methods to store, process, and analyze such data. This makes cs.DB a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
