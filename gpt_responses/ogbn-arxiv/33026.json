The proposed method involves using unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses issues of fairness and bias in face recognition, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cryptography and security (cs.CR).
