The paper also discusses the role of human annotators in creating training data for the classification models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also uses machine learning techniques to construct the classification models, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). \n\nThe paper discusses the quality and size of training data, which is a common topic in the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also mentions the need to monitor the self- and inter-annotator agreements, which is related to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nFinally, the paper analyzes the perception of sentiment classes by humans, which is related to the sub-category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
