Given that the paper focuses on image classification and convolutional neural networks, it is most likely to belong to cs.CV, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of low-rankness and sparsity for network approximation also suggests a possible fit with cs.NE, while the experiments with large datasets and model compression may relate to cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
