The proposed method involves using a semantic segmentation branch and a location-agnostic module, which are both related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The self-supervised learning aspect of the location-agnostic module also relates to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of a deep detector and inference speed may also relate to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
