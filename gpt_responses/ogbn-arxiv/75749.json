The paper also discusses optimization methods for minimizing the error between the measured samples and the signal estimate, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's approach is applicable to various finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals, including continuous phase modulation transmissions, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper's focus on noise robustness is a topic in systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
