The paper also introduces a new data encoding format and computation dataflow, which could potentially fall under the categories of information theory (cs.IT) or signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper presents results on the efficiency of the proposed methods, which could also fall under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
