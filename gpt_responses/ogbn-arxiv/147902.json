The paper also mentions natural distributional problems, which could be related to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The discussion of hardness amplification results could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
