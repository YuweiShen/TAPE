It could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as BO is a popular technique in AI research. The paper's focus on optimization makes it relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. The use of simulators in optimization suggests that it could also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of optimization techniques makes it relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
