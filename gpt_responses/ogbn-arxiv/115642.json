It is also likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new neural architecture that enhances vanilla neural network models with auxiliary neural coherence features. Additionally, it may belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) as it uses deep learning techniques to improve the performance of ATS tasks. Finally, it may also belong to the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with the task of scoring essays, which is a common task in information retrieval systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
