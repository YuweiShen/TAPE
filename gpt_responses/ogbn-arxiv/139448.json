This work involves a combination of device-level and application-level studies, using simulation and experimental characterization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AR (Architecture), which deals with the design and analysis of computer systems. Other relevant sub-categories include cs.ET (Embedded Systems), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering), as the research involves understanding and addressing challenges in memory and storage scaling, which are relevant to these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
