This problem is closely related to the field of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), where low-rank matrix completion is a common task. The paper also involves combinatorial properties of the sampling pattern, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper provides upper bounds on the rank, which can be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction, a topic in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper includes numerical experiments on single-view matrix completion, which is a common task in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
