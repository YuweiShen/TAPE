Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). However, the paper also discusses the potential of mmWave communications and the need for further development, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper evaluates the existing opportunities and shortcomings, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
