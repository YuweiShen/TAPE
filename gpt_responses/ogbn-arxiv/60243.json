The paper focuses on the development of a novel training procedure for the ANN, which enables its use in distribution grids with a high amount of distributed generation and a very limited amount of measurements. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with the monitoring of power grids, which is a control systems (cs.SY) problem. The paper also mentions state estimation (cs.SE) and includes the estimation of line current magnitudes, which is a topic in the Neural Networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
