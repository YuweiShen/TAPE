Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel data augmentation method, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep convolutional neural networks for the task of sketch recognition suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also discusses the practical application of the proposed method to sketch-based image retrieval, which falls under the domain of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
