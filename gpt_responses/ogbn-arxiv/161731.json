The paper proposes a new regularized principal graph learning framework that captures the local information of the underlying graph structure based on reversed graph embedding. This framework has applications in machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
