Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces a novel dataset and proposes a model that combines spatio-temporal human detection and multimodal retrieval, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.MM and cs.IR. Finally, the paper conducts comprehensive experiments and presents a strong baseline, which involves machine learning (ML) techniques and falls under the sub-category of cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
