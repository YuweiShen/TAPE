The paper also involves learning ordinal filters and features, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep feature representations, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
