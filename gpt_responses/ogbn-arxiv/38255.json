The paper proposes a new evaluation metric, AUCCC, to quantitatively evaluate the performance of UQ models. The paper also proposes a new method, UDist, to boost the UQ performance. The paper's focus on machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and medical decision making suggests that it is most likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
