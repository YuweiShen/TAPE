The study of matching problems also falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the problem of blocking edges, which is related to graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents results on the size of matchings in Gabriel graphs, which can be considered as a problem in optimization and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
