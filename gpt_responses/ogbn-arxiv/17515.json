It also involves the study of random matrices, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The use of left-singular vectors and Haar distribution suggests that the paper may also be relevant to matrix multiplication (cs.MM). Finally, the study of capacity scaling in MIMO systems is relevant to control and systems theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
