The proposed solution involves using deep learning models, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the limitations of traditional hash functions, which could be considered under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The proposed solution involves optimizing load distribution, which could be considered under the category of Control Systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of deep learning models for load balancing could also be considered under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
