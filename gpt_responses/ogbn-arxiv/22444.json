The paper discusses the limitations of the existing metric, Age of Information (AoI), and how UoI overcomes those limitations by incorporating time-varying context information and dynamic status evolution. The paper also proposes an update-index-based adaptive scheme to minimize the average UoI for a status update terminal with an updating frequency constraint. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Networked Systems (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Information Theory (cs.IT), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
