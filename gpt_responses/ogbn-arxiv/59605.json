This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for feature extraction and clustering suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE). Finally, the problem of identifying unknown contextual changes in streaming data can also be seen as a problem in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
