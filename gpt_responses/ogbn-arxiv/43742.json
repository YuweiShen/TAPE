The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and matching further supports this categorization.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper focuses on matching line drawings, which is a subfield of computer graphics. The use of non-photorealistic rendering algorithms to generate synthetic sketches also supports this categorization.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a triplet loss function to train the CNN, which is a common technique in machine learning. The use of deep learning for feature extraction and matching also supports this categorization.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with finding correspondences between images, which is a task that falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. The use of deep learning and non-photorealistic rendering algorithms further supports this categorization.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with matching line drawings, which is a type of multimedia content. The use of deep learning for feature extraction and matching also supports this categorization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
