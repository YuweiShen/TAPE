This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE), Embedded Systems (cs.EM), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The tool generates executable code from system models expressed as pCharts, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the specification of properties in an intuitive way without needing to be familiar with temporal logic, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
