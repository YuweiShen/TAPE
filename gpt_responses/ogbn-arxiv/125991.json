The paper proposes differentially private algorithms for online linear optimization in both the full-information and bandit settings. This makes it likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms that can learn from data. The paper proposes algorithms for online learning, which falls under this category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. The paper deals with the problem of differential privacy, which is closely related to information theory. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. The paper proposes algorithms for online learning, which falls under this category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of intelligent agents. The paper proposes algorithms for online learning, which can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of secure systems. The paper deals with the problem of differential privacy, which is closely related to cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
