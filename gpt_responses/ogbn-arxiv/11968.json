The paper also involves the study of submodules of a certain $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$-module, which is related to algebraic structures and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper presents a new algorithm for computing generator polynomials, which falls under the category of algorithm design and analysis (cs.SD). The paper also involves the study of cyclic shifts and invariance properties, which are related to symmetry and group theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the construction of codes, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
