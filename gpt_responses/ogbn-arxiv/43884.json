The model is also applied to show a recursive assembly of an archetypal self-similar aperiodic tiling, which indicates that it could be relevant to Computational Geometry (cs.CG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
