The paper focuses on the use of different methods to replace the singular value decomposition (SVD) method, which is known to have low-convergence when applied to large datasets. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
