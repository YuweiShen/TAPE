The focus is on shallow neural networks, which are a simpler and more interpretable class of models. The paper also studies the over-parameterized regime, which is a current area of interest in deep learning research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses optimization algorithms and convergence rates, which are relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
