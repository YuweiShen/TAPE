Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial and discrete mathematics, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as likely sub-categories. The paper also involves graph theory, which suggests cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as a possible sub-category.
