The proposed framework aims to provide a secure and decentralized approach to access control management, which falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts to implement the proposed framework. This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a novel framework for access control management in decentralized applications, which involves software engineering principles such as decoupling of business logic and access control policies, and efficient smart contract upgrades.\n- cs.DL (Digital Libraries): This category is less likely, but the paper does mention the use of any Turing complete smart contract programming language to implement the framework, which could be relevant to digital libraries.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the integration of the proposed framework with traditional and state of the art identity management solutions, which could involve databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
