This methodology has been applied in different domains, including anomaly detection, risk management, and diagnosis diseases, indicating its relevance to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the accuracy of the proposed method using validity and comparison indexes, which are commonly used in data mining and machine learning (cs.DM). The proposed methodology also involves analysing the objects' movements from their own cluster to another, which is relevant to network analysis and social influence modelling (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of considering the proposed methodology in learning methods to track the behaviour of data objects, which is relevant to neural networks and reinforcement learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
