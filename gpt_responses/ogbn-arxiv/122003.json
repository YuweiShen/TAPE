The first case study involves energy harvesting, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM). The second case study involves processing a large amount of data in real-time, which could be categorized as computer architecture (cs.AR) or control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also discusses video processing, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
