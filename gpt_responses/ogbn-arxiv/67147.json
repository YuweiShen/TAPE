This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of compact space and efficient algorithms also suggests the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper also mentions sequence analysis tasks, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
