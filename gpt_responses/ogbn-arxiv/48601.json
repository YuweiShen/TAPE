It also involves the use of gradient-based saliency maps, which are commonly used in deep learning. Additionally, cs.CV (Computer Vision) is a likely sub-category as the experiments are conducted on ImageNet samples. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a possible sub-category as deep learning is a subfield of AI. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is another possible sub-category as the paper addresses the vulnerability of interpretation methods to adversarial attacks. Finally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
