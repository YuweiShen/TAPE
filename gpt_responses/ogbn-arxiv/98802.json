This is a fundamental idea in information theory and has applications beyond the molecular graphs considered in this work. Therefore, the paper could fit into several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, given the focus on GNNs and the use of molecular graphs as a case study, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
