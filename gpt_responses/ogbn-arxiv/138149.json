This involves combining sequential learning and dilated residual learning to address the challenges of cancelling healthy tissue signal, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited image quality in AF patients. The proposed method is based on computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, which are commonly associated with the arXiv CS sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
