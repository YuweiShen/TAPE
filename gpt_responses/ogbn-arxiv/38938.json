The use of neural network models and regularization techniques suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study of how the models learn to compose meaning of sentences also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
