It also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) as the testing is done from different sites in the U.S., China, and Iran. The paper may also fall under the category of cryptography (cs.CY) as it deals with obfuscated Tor bridges. Additionally, the paper involves data structures (cs.DS) as it measures the delay between the discovery and blocking of proxies.
