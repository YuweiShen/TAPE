The use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the exploration of more robust and precise models also suggest the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on skin lesion analysis and melanoma detection indicates the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, while the use of dilation convolution and conditional random field methods suggests the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
