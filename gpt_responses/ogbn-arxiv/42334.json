The paper also discusses reformulating the learning problem as one-class multiple-instance learning, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses estimating theoretical generalization risk, which is a concept that is relevant to many areas of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
