The paper proposes a new method called Risk Extrapolation (REx) that enables extrapolation beyond the observed training distributions. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
