The paper proposes a decentralized approach to interference management, where each transmitter-receiver pair autonomously tunes its own transmit-receive configurations seeking an $\\eta$-optimal individual transmission rate. This problem falls under the category of decentralized control and optimization, which is a subfield of control theory and optimization. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.IT (Information Theory). \n\nThe paper also deals with the problem of feedback in the interference channel, which is a subfield of networked control systems and communication networks. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nThe paper uses mathematical optimization techniques to approximate the $\\eta$-Nash equilibrium region of the interference channel, which is a subfield of mathematical optimization and game theory. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.MM (Mathematical Optimization) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
