This involves the use of deep convolutional networks and deep features, which are commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.CV). The framework also involves the use of neural networks for clinical decision support, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of radiomics for automatic cancer detection, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of medical imaging data, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
