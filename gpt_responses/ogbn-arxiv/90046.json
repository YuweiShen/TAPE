This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on improving the training of DNNs, which is a core topic in machine learning, we consider cs.LG to be the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
