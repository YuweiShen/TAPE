This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed approach incorporates prior information that is not naturally considered by standard GCN. This is a common theme in artificial intelligence research. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions experiments on semi-supervised classification, which is a common task in computer vision. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with graph convolutional networks, which are commonly used in social and information networks. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a new approach to spectral graph convolutional networks, which can be considered as a type of neural network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
