Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions using stacked BiLSTMs with residual connections, which could be relevant to computer vision tasks, indicating that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
