This method is evaluated by extensive experiments on the WIDER FACE dataset, which is a computer vision task. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the proposed method uses machine learning techniques to achieve comparable performance to deep heavy detectors, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Moreover, the paper involves model architectures and floating point operations, which could also place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
