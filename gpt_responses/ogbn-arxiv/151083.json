The approach involves transforming EEG activities into multi-spectral images and training a deep network to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it aims to improve the classification accuracy of cognitive load from EEG data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
