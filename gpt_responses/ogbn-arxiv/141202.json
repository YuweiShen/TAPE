The paper also extensively uses computer vision techniques such as correlation filters and appearance models, which makes cs.CV a likely sub-category as well. The learning-based tracker also suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with image sequences and their analysis, which could also make multimedia (cs.MM) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
