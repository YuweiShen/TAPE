This involves optimization of objective functions such as mean runtime, percent of instances solved, or score in a competition. The paper also discusses the integration of local search solvers as candidate solvers, predicting performance score instead of runtime, and using hierarchical hardness models that take into account different types of SAT instances. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), software engineering (cs.SE), and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
