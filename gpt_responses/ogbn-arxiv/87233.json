The approach involves learning a mapping of input biometric traits onto a target distribution in a well-behaved space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with security metrics such as Equal Error Rate (EER), False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR), which suggests that it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also mentions experiments conducted on publicly available datasets of face and fingerprint, indicating that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep neural networks suggests that the paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
