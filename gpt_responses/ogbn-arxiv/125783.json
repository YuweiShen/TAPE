Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). Additionally, the paper discusses memory usage and running time, which are related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). The implementation of multi-threading also involves operating system (cs.OS) considerations. Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which are related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
