The dataset used in the paper was collected during natural everyday laptop use, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also presents a method for in-the-wild gaze estimation, which involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks and multimodal learning, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of several state-of-the-art image-based gaze estimation algorithms, which involves comparing and analyzing different approaches, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
