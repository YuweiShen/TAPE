This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the category of \"Category Theory and Logic\" (cs.CT) and \"Discrete Mathematics\" (cs.DM). The mention of groupoids and their use in dealing with symmetries suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of \"Group Theory\" (cs.GR). The mention of quantum field theory suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of \"Quantum Algebra\" (cs.QA). Finally, the mention of \"homotopical species\" and \"locally cartesian closed \\infty-categories\" suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of \"Logic in Computer Science\" (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
