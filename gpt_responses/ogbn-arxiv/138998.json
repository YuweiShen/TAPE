The focus on human expertise and behavioral experiments suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and neuroscience (cs.NE). The investigation of Occam's razor in function learning also suggests a connection to statistical learning theory (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
