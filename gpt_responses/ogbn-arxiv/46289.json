The paper proposes a new elastic distributed training framework that addresses algorithmic bottlenecks. This category is the most likely fit for the paper.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the challenges of micro-tasks in machine learning applications and proposes a new framework to address them. The paper also evaluates the proposed framework on deep neural networks and generalized linear models. This category is also a likely fit for the paper.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses algorithmic bottlenecks in distributed machine learning and proposes a new framework to address them. This category is a possible fit for the paper.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses machine learning algorithms and proposes a new framework to address algorithmic bottlenecks. This category is a possible fit for the paper.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new elastic distributed training framework that enables dynamic load balancing.
