The paper also involves constructing and analyzing the properties of polycubes, which could fall under discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS). The problem of edge-unfolding can also be viewed as a graph theory problem, which could fall under graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
