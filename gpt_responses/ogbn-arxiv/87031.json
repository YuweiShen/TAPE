This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed STCM schemes can be applied to wireless communication systems, which are a part of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes novel STCM schemes that provide trade-offs between decoding complexity, error performance, and data rate. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed STCM schemes can be used for transmitting multimedia data over wireless channels, which falls under the domain of multimedia. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly mention any cryptographic or security-related aspects, but the proposed STCM schemes can potentially be used for secure communication over wireless channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
