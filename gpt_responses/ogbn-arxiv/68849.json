The paper proposes a data augmentation technique using deep learning models (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to handle sudden illumination changes in consecutive frames. The paper also involves image processing techniques (cs.MM) such as Euclidean distance transform and binary masks. Finally, the paper uses experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which involves training deep learning models (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
