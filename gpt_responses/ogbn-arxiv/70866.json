The use of Kalman filters and the estimation of object shape parameters suggest that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.RO (Robotics). The problem of extended object tracking also involves control systems and estimation theory, which are covered by cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the use of closed-form expressions and simulations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
