This involves implementing splitability annotations (SAs) and a small API to split data values in the library. The paper focuses on the implementation of SAs in a system called Mozart and evaluates its performance on workloads using NumPy and Pandas in Python and Intel MKL in C. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages) as the paper proposes a new abstraction for optimizing data movement in parallel applications. Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
