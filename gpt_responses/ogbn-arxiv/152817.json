This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as it involves improving the performance of deep learning models. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel framework called GaterNet, which involves a global gater network for selectively activating filters in the backbone network based on each input. This idea of selectively activating filters is related to the concept of attention mechanisms, which is a popular topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves experiments on image datasets, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
