Theoretical analysis is used to derive key performance metrics of V2V broadcast communications via a stochastic geometry approach. This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Network and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Information Theory (cs.IT), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Performance (cs.PF), and Machine Learning (cs.MA). However, since the focus is on V2V communications, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
