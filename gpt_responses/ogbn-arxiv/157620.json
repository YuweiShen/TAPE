The paper also discusses the use of vector-linear strategies, which is a technique used in signal processing (cs.SI). The extension of the result to the multi-antenna setting involves the use of multiple antennas, which is a topic related to communication engineering (cs.CE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
