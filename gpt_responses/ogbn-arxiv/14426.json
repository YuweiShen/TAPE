The most relevant arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to natural language processing. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which are covered in sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of knowledge graphs suggests a connection to sub-category cs.DB (Databases), while the focus on sentence-level linking suggests a connection to sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
