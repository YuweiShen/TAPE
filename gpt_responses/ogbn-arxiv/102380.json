This involves natural language generation tasks, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper also deals with attention-based mechanisms, which are commonly used in machine learning for tasks such as image recognition (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE). The paper also proposes a novel aggregation strategy, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to combine information from multiple sources. Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which are commonly reported in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
