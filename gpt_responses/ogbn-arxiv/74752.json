The paper also discusses advanced training skills such as dropout and batch normalization, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel measurement for evaluating neural network capacity, which involves techniques related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
