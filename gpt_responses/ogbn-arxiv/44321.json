The use of a deep multi-layer neural network as the base model and the learning of the confidence score by the meta-model are both related to machine learning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The experiments are conducted using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research. The confidence scoring mechanism can be applied to various computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to improve the performance of neural networks by filtering out samples with low confidence. This is a common problem in artificial intelligence, and the proposed method can be applied to various AI tasks. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a deep multi-layer neural network as the base model and investigates linear classifier probes inserted between the various layers. This is related to neural computing and the study of neural networks. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions a filtering task, which can be seen as a security measure to prevent low-confidence samples from being processed further. However, this is a less likely category compared to the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
