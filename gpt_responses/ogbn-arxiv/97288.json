The use of limited information from the preceding subsystem in the cascade suggests the involvement of machine learning techniques (cs.MA) to optimize the control design process. The paper also discusses the composition of new subsystems into the interconnection, which could involve the use of reinforcement learning (cs.LG) or swarm intelligence (cs.SI) to adapt the existing controllers. Finally, the interconnection of subsystems suggests the possibility of robotics applications (cs.RO) where multiple subsystems need to be controlled in a coordinated manner."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
