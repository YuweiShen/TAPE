The notion of envy-freeness is a well-studied concept in fair division (cs.AI), and the paper proposes a new notion of approval envy. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of computing allocations that satisfy this new notion, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses mixed integer programming, which is a common technique in optimization and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses experimental results, which could fall under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
