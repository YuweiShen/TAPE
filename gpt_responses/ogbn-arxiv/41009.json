The most relevant sub-category is likely to be \"cs.CR\" (Cryptography and Security), as the paper deals with privacy and differential privacy. The paper also involves concepts from machine learning and information theory, which suggest \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) and \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory) as possible sub-categories.
