This problem falls under the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), which is a subfield of machine learning (ML) concerned with learning optimal decision-making policies through trial-and-error interactions with an environment. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which covers topics related to the design, analysis, and implementation of ML algorithms and systems. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of techniques from other subfields of CS, such as information retrieval (IR), data structures (DS), multi-agent systems (MA), and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, the paper deals with the problem of bidding for ad impressions in a large-scale real-world auction volume and campaign budget, which requires efficient data structures and algorithms for handling the scalability problem. Moreover, the paper involves the interaction of multiple agents (i.e., advertisers) in a competitive environment, which requires the use of techniques from multi-agent systems. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of learning optimal decision-making policies in a complex and dynamic environment, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.
