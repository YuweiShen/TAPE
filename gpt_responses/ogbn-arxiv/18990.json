This involves considerations of error-correction and avoiding primer-dimer byproducts, which are information-theoretic problems. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents constructions for WMU codes using Dyck paths, which are a type of data structure. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the concept of WMU sequences could have potential applications in cryptography and security, such as in the design of uncorrelated random number generators. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper involves combinatorial and graph-theoretic arguments to derive bounds on the size of WMU codes. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not directly involve computational complexity, but the design of efficient algorithms for constructing WMU codes could be a topic of interest in this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
