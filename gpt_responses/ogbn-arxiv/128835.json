Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves graphics and visualization techniques, which makes cs.GR (Graphics) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the need for flexible and personalized assessment criteria, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.LG (Machine Learning).
