Additionally, the paper deals with privacy concerns, which could also place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. The use of multi-party collaboration and feature selection could also suggest a potential fit for the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories.
