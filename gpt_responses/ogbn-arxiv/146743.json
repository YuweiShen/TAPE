The paper also introduces a novel statistical framework for design and assessment of URLLC systems, which involves learning the channel model using training data, and selecting the transmission rate to satisfy the required reliability. This framework involves statistical learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY) techniques. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of adequate model selection and learning for designing consistent physical layer that asymptotically behaves as if the channel was known perfectly, which is a problem that can be addressed using machine learning (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
