This falls under the domain of machine learning and specifically clustering. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions using multi-view datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision applications. Additionally, the proposed technique could potentially be applied to image or video data. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new technique for clustering, which is a common task in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions using local graph structures, which are commonly used in network analysis. Additionally, the proposed technique could potentially be applied to social network data. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions using multi-view datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia applications. Additionally, the proposed technique could potentially be applied to audio or text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
