The method involves training the robot in reverse, gradually learning to reach the goal from a set of start states increasingly far from the goal. This approach is applicable to a wide range of tasks, including navigation and manipulation, which suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\nThe most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper proposes a novel method for reinforcement learning. The second most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), as the paper focuses on training a robot to achieve goal-oriented tasks. The third likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper proposes a method for learning tasks without requiring prior knowledge. The fourth likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision), as the paper mentions fine-grained manipulation problems that may involve visual perception. The fifth likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper involves controlling a robot to achieve a desired state."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
