The paper discusses the use of memory to reduce the effects of vanishing gradients and create shortcut connections. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of heuristics to simplify the learning problem, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper's focus on long-term dependency tasks and the use of memory to store previous hidden states suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper's use of memory to revisit previous states and its evaluation on different tasks suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. Finally, the paper's potential applications in computer vision suggest that it may also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
