The use of axis-parallel boxes suggests a connection to computational geometry as well. The uniform bound on the volume of non-intersecting boxes may involve techniques from numerical analysis (cs.NA) and discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the fact that the result was obtained independently by another researcher suggests that it may be of interest to the machine learning community (cs.ML)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
