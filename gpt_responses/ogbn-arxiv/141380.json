Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a fair representation learning approach to address the confounding effects of age, which involves neural network classifiers and optimization techniques, indicating a focus on deep learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG and cs.AI).
