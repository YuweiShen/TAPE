Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also proposes a new approach called Code Clone matching (CC matching), which involves token-based clone detection and meta-patterns enhanced with meta-tokens. This suggests that the paper could also fit into cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SD (Software Development)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
