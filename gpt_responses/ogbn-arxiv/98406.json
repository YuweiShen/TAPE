This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new framework for stream processing systems, which involves designing and implementing new software components. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the implementation of elastic executors, which involves load balancing and scaling, which falls under the scope of programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
