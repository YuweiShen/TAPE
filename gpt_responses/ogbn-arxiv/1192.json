The focus on accuracy and size reduction also aligns with the interests of this sub-category.\n- cs.CR: The paper discusses a verification tool, which is related to the field of computer security. The potential significance of the simplification process for improving the security of DNNs could also make this sub-category relevant.\n- cs.SE: The paper discusses a workflow for simplifying neural networks, which could be seen as a software engineering problem. The focus on maintaining accuracy while reducing size also aligns with the interests of this sub-category.\n- cs.SY: The paper discusses the use of a verification tool for analyzing and modifying a complex system (i.e. a DNN).
