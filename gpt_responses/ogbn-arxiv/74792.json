This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. Additionally, the paper also addresses the issue of mutual interference suppression, which is a common problem in wireless networks and falls under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of statistical CSI to avoid pilot-based channel estimation also suggests that the paper may belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The fact that the paper deals with massive MIMO systems, which involve a large number of antennas, suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data. Finally, the paper also involves the design of downlink transmission modes, which is a topic that falls under the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
