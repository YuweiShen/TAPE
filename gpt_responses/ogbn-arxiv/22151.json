This is a core area of research in distributed computing, making cs.DC the most likely category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes an optimization problem for minimizing latency in erasure-coded storage systems, which involves designing efficient algorithms for data placement and retrieval. This makes cs.DS a likely category as well.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with optimizing the performance of a complex system (erasure-coded storage) by controlling various parameters such as data placement and server selection. This makes cs.SY a possible category.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper derives upper bounds on tail latency for arbitrary service time distributions, which involves analyzing the information content of the system. This makes cs.IT a possible category as well.\n5. cs.PF (Performance) - The paper focuses on optimizing the performance of erasure-coded storage systems by reducing tail latency, which is a key performance metric. This makes cs.PF a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
