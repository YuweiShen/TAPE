The use of machine learning techniques such as Gaussian processes (GP) and model predictive control (MPC) suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on safety and adaptation in changing operating conditions suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV), as vision is used for localization in the experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
