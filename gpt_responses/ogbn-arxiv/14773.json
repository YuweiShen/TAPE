The tool is based on the Eiffel programming language, which is a programming language (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the need for improvement in the tool itself and in the Eiffel IDE, which could fall under the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. The Tokeneer problem, which is used as a benchmark, involves security and access control, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the verification of a real piece of software, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
