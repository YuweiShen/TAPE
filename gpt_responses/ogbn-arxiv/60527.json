This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of symmetry and geometry constraints, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper uses neural networks for training, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
