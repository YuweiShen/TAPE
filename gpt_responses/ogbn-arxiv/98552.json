This involves data augmentation using extra unlabeled data and a weighted label smoothing regularization (WLSR) method. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of CNNs and regularization techniques suggest that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as data augmentation and regularization, which may also make it relevant to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
