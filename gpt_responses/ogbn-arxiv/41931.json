The use of hidden Markov models and decision trees also suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The use of speech waveforms and automatic feature extraction suggests a focus on signal processing, which falls under cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) and cs.SI (Signal Processing). Finally, the evaluation metrics used in the study suggest a focus on statistical analysis and modeling, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
