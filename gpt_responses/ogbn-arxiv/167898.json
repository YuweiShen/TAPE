The use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is a popular technique in the field of deep learning, and the paper applies this technique to the problem of learning with few clean and many noisy labels. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as well. Finally, the paper discusses the problem of adversarial attacks, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
