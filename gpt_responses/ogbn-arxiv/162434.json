The use of finite transition systems and temporal logic-based high level plans suggests a focus on control theory and systems (cs.SY), while the need for collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance implies a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of local information and limited sensing capabilities suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
