This involves solving an optimal transport problem using the Wasserstein metric for Gaussian distributions. The proposed distance is tested on tasks of retrieval and classification of time series. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, since the paper deals with statistical models and probability distributions, it could also be relevant to cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
