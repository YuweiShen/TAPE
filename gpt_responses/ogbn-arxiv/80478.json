This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also presents a new model for this task, which involves extracting decision rules from procedural text and reasoning about which rules are entailed by the conversational history. This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques to gather relevant information from the procedural text. Finally, the paper presents a new state-of-the-art model for this task, which involves neural networks and deep learning techniques (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
