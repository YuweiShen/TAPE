The paper also discusses moment invariants, which are a common tool in machine learning and pattern recognition, making the paper relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents a framework for deriving invariants for data in any dimension with any number of channels, which could be of interest to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
