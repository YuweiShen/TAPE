Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which covers deep learning and sequence modeling. The paper also involves biomedical signal processing and physiological modeling, which could fall into cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper utilizes bidirectional structure and residual connections, which are common techniques in natural language processing and computer vision, indicating a possible connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
