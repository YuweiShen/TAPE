Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses model compression, which is a common topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), suggesting cs.AI as the second likely sub-category. The use of multi-teacher knowledge distillation and downstream tasks suggests cs.LG (Learning) as the third likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) as it deals with web question answering, making cs.IR a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper may also involve computer vision (CV) as it discusses the use of complex models, which is a common topic in CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
