The algorithm involves MA cancellation and spectral analysis, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The application of the algorithm is in the field of healthcare (cs.BIO) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of PPG signals for heart rate tracking is also relevant to the field of neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
