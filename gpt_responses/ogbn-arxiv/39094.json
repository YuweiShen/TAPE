This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper utilizes layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to maintain interpretability of the neuroimaging data, which suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of neuroimaging data, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
