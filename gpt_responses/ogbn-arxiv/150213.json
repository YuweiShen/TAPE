The paper involves learning from data and using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with human trust as a latent variable. The paper also involves human subject experiments on a table-clearing task in simulation and with a real robot. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
