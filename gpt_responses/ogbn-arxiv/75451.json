Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new network architecture, which involves training and inference techniques, indicating that it could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses high-resolution feature pyramids, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
