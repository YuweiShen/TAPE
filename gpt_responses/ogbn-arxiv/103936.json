It also involves distributed computing (cs.DC) and network infrastructure (cs.NI) as the security of the blockchain relies on the distributed protocol and the participation of miners. Game theory (cs.GT) is also relevant as the paper analyzes the incentives of miners and the potential for collusion. Finally, the proposed modification to the protocol involves system implementation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
