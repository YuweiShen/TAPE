The paper also discusses the use of multi-scale mechanism and deep learning-based face descriptors, which are relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the proposed descriptor under the image retrieval framework, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses several face databases to test the performance of the proposed descriptor, which is relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
