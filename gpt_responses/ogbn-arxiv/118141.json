This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the trade-off between beamwidth design and coverage/area spectral efficiency, which is related to information theory. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The use of millimetre-wave signals is often associated with multimedia applications, such as high-speed data transfer and video streaming. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper involves the design and optimization of a network system, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) - The deployment of multiple access points and the evaluation of their performance can be seen as a multi-agent system, where each access point acts as an agent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
