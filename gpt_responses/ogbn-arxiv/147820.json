The paper focuses on generating counterexamples for Markov Chains and Markov Decision Processes, which are commonly used in the field of computer science. The paper also discusses the properties that witnesses should satisfy in order to be useful as debugging aid. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
