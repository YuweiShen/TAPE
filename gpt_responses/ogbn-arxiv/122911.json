The computing approach focuses on creating a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace that ensures the integrity of trade agreements. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the economic aspects of the marketplace, including maximizing the participant's utility to improve the sustainability and usability of the marketplace. It also considers the impact of the marketplace on the privacy and security of personal data. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the use of smart contracts to guarantee that the participants automatically conform to the terms of the agreements without involving a mediator. It also considers the impact of the marketplace on the privacy and security of personal data. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the trading of real-time IoT data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices. It also considers the impact of the buyer's demand on the battery drainage of the IoT devices under different scenarios. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a blockchain framework underpinned by an Energy-Aware Demand Selection and Allocation (EDSA) mechanism that optimizes the revenue for the seller and fulfills the buyer's demands. It also uses a normalized revenue-based greedy algorithm for solving the EDSA problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
