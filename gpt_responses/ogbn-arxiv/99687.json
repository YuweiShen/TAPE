This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme is relevant to wireless networks, where feedback is often limited. The paper discusses the impact of feedback on scheduling decisions and the sum rate of the system.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a heuristic method for achieving the maximum expected weighted rate in the general asymmetric M-user case. This involves designing a control algorithm for scheduling decisions.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the impact of feedback on the sum rate of the system, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a heuristic method for achieving the maximum expected weighted rate in the general asymmetric M-user case, which involves optimizing a non-convex objective function.
