Additionally, the paper mentions deep learning and neuromorphic hardware, which are both related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The discussion of materials science and the end of Moore's Law suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) sub-category.
