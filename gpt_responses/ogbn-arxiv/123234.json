The paper proposes a novel approach called Hierarchical Auto-Zoom Net (HAZN) that adapts to the local scales of objects and parts. This approach involves the use of fully convolutional networks and is focused on improving the accuracy of parsing. Given the focus on computer vision and deep learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in multimedia processing, leading to the possibility of cs.MM (Multimedia) being a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of natural language processing techniques to describe the approach, which could make cs.CL (Computation and Language) a relevant sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
