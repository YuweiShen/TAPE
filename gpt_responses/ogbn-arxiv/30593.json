These are core topics in computer vision.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper presents a tracking system for live fish using a trawl-based underwater camera system. This involves robotics and automation.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with processing and analyzing low-contrast and low-frame-rate stereo videos of live fish. This is a multimedia-related problem.\n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses a block-matching approach for stereo matching that enables an automatic fish-body tail compensation. This involves graphics and image processing.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses a modified Viterbi data association algorithm for multiple-target tracking. This algorithm is also used in information retrieval and natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
