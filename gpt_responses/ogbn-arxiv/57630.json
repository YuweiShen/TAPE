The presence of an active adversary who can maliciously flip bits suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computer security (cs.CR). The use of a shared key for reliable covert communication suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CC). The paper may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) since the results may have applications in secure communication of multimedia data. Finally, the paper may belong to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) since the results may have implications for the design of secure communication protocols over networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
