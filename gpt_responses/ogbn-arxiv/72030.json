The use of rich patterns and description language also suggests a focus on machine learning and statistical modeling, which are covered by the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper mentions discovering meaningful semantics, which could involve natural language processing and text analysis, covered by the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL).
