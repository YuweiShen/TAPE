Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces an undirected graph to describe the topological structure of FRI signals, which suggests that it may be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, the paper proposes a stable algorithm with linear complexity, which may be of interest to researchers in cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
