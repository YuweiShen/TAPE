The paper's dataset and evaluation are relevant to the robotics community.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions using machine learning techniques for visual-inertial odometry, and the comparison with recent methods published in academic forums suggests a machine learning component.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to cs.LG, the paper's use of machine learning techniques and comparison with recent methods suggests an AI component.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper mentions using a Google Tango device, which is a platform for augmented reality (AR) applications. AR involves graphics and computer vision, so cs.GR is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
