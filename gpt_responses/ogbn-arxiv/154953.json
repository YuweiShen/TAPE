The paper also discusses encoding and decoding algorithms, which fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of generating matrices and linear codes suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the application of rateless codes to communication networks implies a connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
