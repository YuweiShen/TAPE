The paper focuses on biological learning factors and their computational counterparts for modeling the progressive acquisition of increasingly complex knowledge and skills in a continual fashion. Given this focus, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
