Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also proposes new techniques for efficient reordering, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of parameter settings and pre-processing step to improve translation quality can be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) respectively. Finally, the paper also deals with improving the quality of translation, which can be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
