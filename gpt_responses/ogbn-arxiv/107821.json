These applications are closely related to computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the general frameworks to make these operations reversible, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.MM and cs.CV, followed by cs.CR, cs.IT, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
