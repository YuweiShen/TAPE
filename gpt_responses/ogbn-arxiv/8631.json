The paper also introduces a data-driven approach for learning the topology of X-CNNs, which involves optimization and learning procedures, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the implementation of the methodology in the Xsertion library, which suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
