The use of buffer to store the quantized analogue source before transmission is a common technique in multimedia systems (cs.MM). The investigation of the tradeoff between distortion and delay is a problem in control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
