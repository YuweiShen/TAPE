The paper discusses the distributed and heterogeneous nature of these networks and proposes a distributed SDN control plane called DISCO. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the resilience and security of the proposed control plane, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
