The paper also involves game theory (cs.GT) as the users and the jammer are participating in a non-cooperative zero-sum game. The paper also discusses power allocation strategies, which is a topic in networked control systems (cs.NI) and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves optimization (cs.MM) as the objective function is to maximize the mutual information in the channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
