The use of feedback in the channel also suggests a possible connection to control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of power-splitting and interference cancellation techniques, which are commonly used in wireless communication networks (cs.NI). The quantification of energy transmission enhancement may also relate to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
