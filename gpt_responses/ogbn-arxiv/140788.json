RBAC is a security mechanism and falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a work-in-progress on combining graphical and formal modelling to specify and verify dynamic access control. This falls under the scope of software engineering as it deals with the design and development of software systems.\n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the modelling of state-dependent access rights which involves the use of programming languages to define the dependencies between the system states and permissions to access and modify certain data.\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses Event B, a formal method based on set theory and predicate logic, to model and verify dynamic access control. This falls under the scope of logic in computer science.\n5. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses access control mechanisms used to manage data-access constraints in a wide range of systems. This falls under the scope of databases as access control is an important aspect of database management."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
