This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the impact of imperfect channel state information (cs.SI) and proposes a new transmission scheme to improve the degrees of freedom (cs.MM). Finally, the paper considers the optimality of the proposed scheme (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
