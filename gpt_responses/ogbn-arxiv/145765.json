The paper also discusses the mean squared error (MSE) performance of the sensing matrices, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of convex optimization techniques and numerical investigations suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
