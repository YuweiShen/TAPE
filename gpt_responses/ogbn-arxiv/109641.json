The use of kernel tests and selective inference suggests a focus on topics related to statistical learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve synthetic and real-world data, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and statistics (cs.ST). Finally, the use of multiscale bootstrap suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
