It also deals with the general problem of learning from data (cs.LG) and the sample complexity of learning algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the statistical query (SQ) model, which is a framework for learning algorithms (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses local (or randomized response) algorithms, which are a type of distributed algorithm used for privacy-preserving data analysis (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
