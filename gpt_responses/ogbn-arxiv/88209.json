The use of clausal representation of knowledge and recursion in logic programs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper deals with the decidability of implication between clauses, which falls under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
