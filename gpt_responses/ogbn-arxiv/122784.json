The use of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of Medical Segmentation Decathlon Spleen dataset suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
