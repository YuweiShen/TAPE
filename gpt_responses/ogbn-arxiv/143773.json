The use of multiple antennas also involves multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the division of antennas between the sender and intended receiver, which could be related to networked systems (cs.NI) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
