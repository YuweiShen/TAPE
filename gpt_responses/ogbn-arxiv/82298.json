The paper also discusses physical layer sensing techniques and medium access control layer sensing algorithms, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The analysis of performance metrics such as throughput and collision probability involves system modeling and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions buffering of incoming SU traffic, which is related to multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
