The use of metamorphic testing, which involves testing the system using transformations of inputs rather than relying on a test oracle, is a technique that can be applied to a variety of systems and programming languages, making it relevant to the software infrastructure (cs.SI) and programming languages (cs.PL) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the automation of testing, which can involve distributed computing and parallel processing, making it relevant to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
