The use of coalgebras and regular expression calculi suggests a connection to logic and automata theory, hence the categories cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) are likely. The paper also introduces a new notion, proper functors, which may be of interest to researchers in programming languages (cs.PL) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the use of weighted automata suggests a connection to formal languages (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
