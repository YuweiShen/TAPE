Specifically, it focuses on understanding the trade-off in robustness to different types of perturbations and training models that are simultaneously robust to multiple perturbation types. This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), cryptography and security (cs.CR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
