This approach involves extending thermodynamic foundations into complex, non-equilibrium, self-organizing systems and applying them holistically to future computing systems. This interdisciplinary approach involves concepts from electrical engineering, computer science, physics, and materials science, making it likely to be categorized under cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), cs.AR (Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.EM (Electromagnetism), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
