The authors propose a new concept of contextual visual similarity, which involves learning feature weights over all the feature dimensions of each image to encode the contextualized visual similarity specified by the user. This involves machine learning techniques such as feature weighting and distance metrics, which are also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the usefulness of their approach for different tasks, such as answering visual analogy questions and unsupervised attribute discovery, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
