The evaluation criteria and benchmarking of different kinodynamic planners involve analyzing the performance of the planners in different scenarios, which requires system-level analysis and control (cs.SY). The use of different planners and the comparison of their performance suggest the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The analysis of the quality of the solution in terms of dynamical parameters may involve machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.LG). Finally, the scenarios used for benchmarking may involve computer vision techniques for object recognition and manipulation (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
