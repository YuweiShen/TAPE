Additionally, the paper mentions tf-idf, a common technique used in information retrieval, which falls under the purview of cs.IR (Information Retrieval).\n\nThe paper's focus on supervised learning and its comparison to baseline weighting schemes suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
