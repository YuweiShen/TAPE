The paper also discusses the use of various algebraic structures such as Clifford Unitary Weight Designs (CUWDs), Coordinate Interleaved Orthogonal Designs (CIODs), Cyclic Division Algebras (CDAs), and Crossed-Product Algebras (CPAs), which are topics in algebra and number theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the reduction of decoding complexity, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also deals with the optimization of decoding algorithms, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with the application of STBCs in wireless communication systems, which is a topic in control systems and robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
