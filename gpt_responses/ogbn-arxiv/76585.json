This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including multimedia (cs.MM), information theory (cs.IT), computer vision (cs.CV), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and game theory (cs.GT). However, given the focus on video encoding and transmission, as well as the use of rate-distortion models and optimization algorithms, cs.MM and cs.IT are the most likely sub-categories. The use of computer vision techniques and client navigation models also suggests cs.CV and cs.NI as possible sub-categories. The use of optimization techniques and game theory concepts further suggests cs.GT as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
