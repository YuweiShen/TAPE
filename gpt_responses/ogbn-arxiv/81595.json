This problem is closely related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR), as the goal is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the stored messages. The paper also involves the study of codes and their efficiency, which falls under the categories of information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). The use of group theory in the paper suggests a possible connection to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS), while the applications of the proposed codes to secret sharing and wiretap channels suggest a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
