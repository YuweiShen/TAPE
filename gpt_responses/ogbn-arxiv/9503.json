This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with cooperative networks and proposes a power allocation strategy to enhance the efficiency of OFDM index modulation. This is relevant to the networking and internet architecture domain. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates an optimization problem based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to allocate power to active subcarriers. This involves control and optimization techniques, which are relevant to the systems and control domain. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of adaptive OFDM index modulation for cell-edge communications, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and reliable connectivity. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the design and deployment of communication systems that affect society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
