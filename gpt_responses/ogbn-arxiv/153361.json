The paper focuses on improving the performance of algorithms for a wider range of problems by using references as search targets. This paper combines new strategies such as reference adaptation and adaptive local mating to solve different types of problems. The proposed algorithm is compared with state of the arts on a wide range of problems with diverse characteristics. The paper's content is related to neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
