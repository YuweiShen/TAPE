This involves modeling techniques for efficient detection and recognition of text in images, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the understanding of textual information in image content is important for search and recommendation applications, which relates to natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the system architecture and evaluation of the presented technologies, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
