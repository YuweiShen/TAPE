The focus on quantile estimation also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.ST). The use of frugal algorithms, which are designed to work with small amounts of memory, is a topic that falls under the umbrella of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
