The use of optical camera communication (OCC) for vehicular communication also falls under this category. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses capacity maximization in vehicular OCC through power allocation and adaptive modulation schemes. This involves the use of information theory concepts such as channel capacity and modulation schemes. \n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper uses OCC, which is a technology that involves the use of cameras, to enable vehicular communication. This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the use of OCC for autonomous vehicles, which is a key area of research in robotics. \n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of OCC for vehicular communication, which involves the transmission of multimedia data such as video and images. This falls under the domain of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
