The system involves coordination of UAVs in a specific formation to collect data of the inspecting objects. The communication platform for data transmission is based on the Internet of things (IoT). The paper proposes an online image-processing technique based on histograms to detect potential damage or defects. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper involves the coordination of multiple UAVs for surface inspection, which falls under the domain of robotics. \n\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes an online image-processing technique based on histograms to detect potential damage or defects, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n\n3. cs.IOT (Internet of Things): The communication platform for data transmission is based on the Internet of things (IoT), which falls under the domain of IoT. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a real-time control system for surface inspection using multiple UAVs, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n\n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural or evolutionary computing techniques, these techniques could potentially be used for image processing or control of the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
