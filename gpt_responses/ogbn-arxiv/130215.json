This involves a joint effort between medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of RNNs, which are a type of machine learning algorithm used for sequential data analysis. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with the development and analysis of algorithms that improve their performance with experience. \n\nThe paper also involves the analysis of EMRs, which are a type of structured data. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CY (Computers and Society), which deals with the social and ethical implications of computing technologies. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract medical codes from EMRs. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the study of computational aspects of natural language and the design of algorithms for NLP tasks. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the design of an interpretable and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX.
