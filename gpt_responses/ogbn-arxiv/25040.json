The proposed method involves training an embedding network with self-supervised learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of pre-trained methods and the need for a more generalized approach, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two datasets and discusses the results, which involves natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) and multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
