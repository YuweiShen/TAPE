The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques to process real-world camera streams (cs.CV). The proposed scheme involves generating visual attentions and an evolving knowledge graph, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also involves natural language processing techniques to work with the ontology system (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
