The paper focuses on the joint design of the 3D aerial trajectory and wireless resource allocation for maximizing the system sum throughput. This involves taking into account the aerodynamic power consumption, solar energy harvesting, a finite energy storage capacity, and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. The paper also considers both offline and online resource allocation designs. Given these considerations, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
