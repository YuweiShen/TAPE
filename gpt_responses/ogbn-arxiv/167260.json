This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with control and optimization (cs.RO) and system dynamics (cs.SY) as it focuses on learning policies that are robust to model uncertainty. Finally, the paper involves multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as it presents experimental results on solving multiple tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
