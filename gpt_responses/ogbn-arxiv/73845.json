This is a topic that falls under programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also applies refinement types to relational algebra and safe database access, which suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB). The use of combinators for branching and looping suggests a connection to program verification and logic (cs.LO), while the implementation of a refined IO monad suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of Floyd-Hoare logic suggests a connection to formal methods and program verification (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
