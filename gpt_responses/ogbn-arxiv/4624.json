The paper also presents an algorithmic approach to decide the equivalence of polyadic decompositions, which involves computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The study of equivalence classes of decompositions also involves the use of combinatorial techniques (cs.CC) and linear algebra (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
