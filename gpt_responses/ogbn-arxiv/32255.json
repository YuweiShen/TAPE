The paper also proposes robust estimators and convex relaxations, which are techniques commonly used in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Control Systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with optimization problems, which is a topic that falls under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
