The proposed model and method are applicable to a wide range of objects and situations, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions trajectory optimization in visual tracking, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
