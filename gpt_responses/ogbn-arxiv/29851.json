This is a core topic in robotics, and the paper is likely to be classified under this sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses visual sensors (cameras) to estimate the state of the robot. Computer vision is a key component of the proposed method, and the paper is likely to be classified under this sub-category as well. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the estimation of the state of a system (the aerial robot) using sensor data. This is a core topic in systems and control, and the paper may be classified under this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may use machine learning techniques to process the sensor data and estimate the state of the robot. This is a possibility, and the paper may be classified under this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper may use AI techniques to process the sensor data and estimate the state of the robot. This is a possibility, and the paper may be classified under this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
