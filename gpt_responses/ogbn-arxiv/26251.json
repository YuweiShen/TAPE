The method involves calibrating predictive uncertainties using Renyi entropy regularization and variational Bayes learning. These techniques are commonly used in the sub-fields of machine learning such as deep learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
