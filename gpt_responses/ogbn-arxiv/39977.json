This involves extracting and using different classes of lower bounds. The paper is likely to be categorized under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with planning and decision-making. It may also be categorized under Programming Languages (cs.PL) as it deals with PPDDL language. Additionally, it may be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it involves probabilistic reasoning. It may also be categorized under Robotics (cs.RO) as it involves decision-making in uncertain environments. Finally, it may be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY) as it involves control of probabilistic systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
