The paper proposes a new SR network architecture that enhances edges in the output image, which involves using edge detection networks (cs.MM) and feature merge networks (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the trade-off between peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and perceptual quality, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
