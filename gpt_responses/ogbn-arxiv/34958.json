The concept of state space abstraction is relevant to systems and control theory (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the application of these methods in different domains, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
