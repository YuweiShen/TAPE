The paper also discusses optimization techniques for efficient training, which falls under the category of optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since boosting is commonly used in these fields. The paper also discusses optimization techniques, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
