This involves the integration of cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the radio access network to provide real-time, high-bandwidth, low-latency access to radio network resources. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
