Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses word embedding, which is a common technique in the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of predictive queries, which is a common topic in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
