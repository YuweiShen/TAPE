The paper also focuses on the nearest neighbor search problem, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the structural properties of the learned graphs, which is related to graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a probabilistic model for the similarity graph, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
