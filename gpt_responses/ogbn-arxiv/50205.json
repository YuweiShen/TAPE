The paper also discusses the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the secrecy outage probability, which is a common consideration in wireless networking (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes a simple expression for the secrecy outage probability, which could be relevant to communication systems optimization (cs.SI) and network modeling (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
