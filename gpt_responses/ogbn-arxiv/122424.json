The technique is also applicable to distributed storage (cs.DC) and information dispersal schemes (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the potential use of the technique in computational secret sharing, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
