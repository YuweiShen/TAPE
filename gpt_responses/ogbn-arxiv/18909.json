The proposed method involves learning optimal fusing weights for different convolutional layers, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The use of a multi-scale ADPM model also involves learning complementary information from different scales of images, which is another machine learning task (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of spatial pyramid pooling (SPP-net) as the basic deep network, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
