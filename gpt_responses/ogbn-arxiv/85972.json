The paper also discusses the issue of overfitting and the need for feature selection, which is relevant to the field of neural networks (cs.NE) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper includes experiments on real datasets, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) if the datasets are image-based."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
