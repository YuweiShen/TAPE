This could fall under several sub-categories, but the most likely is cs.IT (Information Theory), as phase retrieval is a problem in signal processing and information theory. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of empirical datasets, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of optimization methods, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper mentions the use of publicly available datasets, which suggests a connection to scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
