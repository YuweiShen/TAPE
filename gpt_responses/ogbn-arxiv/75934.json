The paper also discusses log-loss distortion, which is a commonly used utility metric in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a new algorithm for solving a non-convex optimization problem, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses privacy constraints and leakage metrics, which are typically studied in the field of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of interaction in specific source classes, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
