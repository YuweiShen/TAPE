The use of binary decision diagrams and mixed-integer linear programming suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Operations Research (cs.OR), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on optimization and decomposition also suggests the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) as likely candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
