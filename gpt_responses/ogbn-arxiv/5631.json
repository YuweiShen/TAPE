The proposed method involves regression models and optimization algorithms, which are also common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions multimodal face recognition, which involves multiple types of data such as images and videos, and could fall under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the handling of complex noises, which could be related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
