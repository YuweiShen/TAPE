The focus is on reducing the size of propositional deductions, which is a topic that falls under the category of logic and computation (cs.LO). The paper specifically deals with implicational logic, which is a subfield of logic and proof theory (cs.PL). The use of graphs to represent deductions also has connections to data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the normalization procedure used in the paper has implications for computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
