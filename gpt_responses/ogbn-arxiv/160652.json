This involves analyzing aviation information and eyeball movement data to improve terrain display and detect risky operations. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as it involves designing a system that interacts with human pilots. The paper also involves computer graphics and image processing techniques to render terrain data, which falls under cs.GR (Computer Graphics) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) respectively. The system also involves analyzing data to detect risky operations, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
