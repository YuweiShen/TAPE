The paper also discusses the construction of a new classifier that is robust to adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The examples presented in the paper involve image classification, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also uses techniques like random partitions and doubling dimension, which are commonly used in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of bounds, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
