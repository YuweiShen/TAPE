This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of thresholds and erasures, which are common techniques in network information theory (cs.NI). The use of algebraic techniques for decoding suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses an approach from Zyablov, who is a well-known researcher in coding theory (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
