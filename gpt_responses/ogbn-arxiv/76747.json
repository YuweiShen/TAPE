Computer vision techniques such as dimensionality reduction and search algorithms are used in the proposed architecture. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes the use of nonlinear geometric dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and the fastest known Euclidean search algorithm for time series (MASS) to find radar analogs in constant time. These are machine learning techniques used for efficient search and retrieval of analogs. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses the problem of searching for similar spatiotemporal precipitation patterns in a large archive of historical records. This is a problem of information retrieval and the proposed architecture aims to solve this problem efficiently. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes the use of the fastest known Euclidean search algorithm for time series (MASS) for efficient search and retrieval of analogs. This is a data structure and algorithmic problem that the paper addresses. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper discusses the use of dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP and PCA for efficient search and retrieval of analogs. These are mathematical techniques used for data analysis and retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
