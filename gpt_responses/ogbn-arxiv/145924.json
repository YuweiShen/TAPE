The use of Bayesian optimization to learn curricula is a machine learning technique that falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is also a likely category for this paper. Additionally, the paper involves optimizing performance on downstream tasks, which is a common theme in the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of a linear ranking function and engineered feature vector suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
