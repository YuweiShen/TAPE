The MacWilliams-type identity is a well-known concept in coding theory (cs.CC), which is closely related to information theory. The study of linear isometries is also relevant to coding theory and discrete mathematics. The paper also mentions coverings, which are often studied in the context of graph theory and topology, which fall under the categories of cs.DS and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
