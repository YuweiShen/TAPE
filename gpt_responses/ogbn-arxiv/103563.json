It may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a novel transition system and dynamic oracle for parsing, which involves machine learning and AI techniques. Additionally, it may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it discusses the Covington algorithm and its variants.
