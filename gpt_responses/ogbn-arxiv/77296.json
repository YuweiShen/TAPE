The use of CAD models as priors is a common approach in this field, and the paper proposes a novel pipeline for handling dynamic clutter and occlusions. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a novel object detection method, which could fall under cs.CV or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of linear complexity for creating a pose graph could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
