The paper also discusses the representation of effects, which is a topic of interest in programming language research.\n\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the use of monad transformers to accumulate observations about the course of execution as an effect. This could be seen as a form of logical reasoning about the behavior of the program.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of monad transformers to reveal the internals of a computation, which could be useful in debugging and testing software.\n\n4. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the use of monad transformers to add functionality to existing monads, which could be seen as a form of language extension.\n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of monad transformers to work with non-terminating computations, which could be seen as a form of algorithm design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
