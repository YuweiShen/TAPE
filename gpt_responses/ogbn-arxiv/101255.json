The paper also presents a novel fuzzing framework, which involves symbolic execution and program analysis, making it relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The use of symbolic execution also makes it relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category.
