The paper also develops an algorithm for finding fair and efficient allocations, which involves designing data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and analyzing their complexity. The paper further discusses the concept of Nash social welfare, which is a central notion in computational economics (cs.EC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
