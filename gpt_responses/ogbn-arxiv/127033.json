The paper also proposes a new approach to identity provisioning that emphasizes trust and decentralization, which are important topics in the field of cryptography and security.\n\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the social implications of digital identity and the potential impacts of distributed identity provisioning in the Information Society. This makes it a likely candidate for the Computers and Society sub-category.\n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the role of social trust in identity provisioning and the potential for decentralized identity systems to leverage social networks. This makes it a possible candidate for the Social and Information Networks sub-category.\n\n4. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new approach to identity provisioning that involves the development of user-centric distributed identity systems. This makes it a possible candidate for the Software Engineering sub-category.\n\n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the user experience of digital identity and the potential for user-centric identity systems to improve privacy and control for users. This makes it a possible candidate for the Human-Computer Interaction sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
