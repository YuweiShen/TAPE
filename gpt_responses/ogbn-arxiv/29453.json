The paper specifically focuses on opinion evolution in time-varying social influence networks with prejudiced agents. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science). Additionally, the paper involves mathematical modeling and analysis, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of an existing opinion formation model, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
