The approach involves a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the \\textit{Construe} abductive framework, followed by feature extraction and machine learning classification. This work involves several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational engineering (cs.CE), databases (cs.DB), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
