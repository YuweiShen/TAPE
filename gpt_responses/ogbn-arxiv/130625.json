Specifically, it focuses on learning spatial features via a convolutional neural network (CNN) and then mapping their temporal relationship with the aid of Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a deep fusion framework that combines both spatial and temporal features, which involves training multiple models and fusing their outputs. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Furthermore, the paper deals with video sequences, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses deep learning approaches, which suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
