The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks (cs.CV) using popular network architectures (LeNet-5 and ResNet-20) and datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10), which are common in computer vision research. The approach involves learning activation functions for neurons, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
