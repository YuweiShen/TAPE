The algorithm is of the gradient type and can be used with function approximators such as neural networks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
