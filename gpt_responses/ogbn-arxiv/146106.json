The paper proposes a transfer learning approach for AAMs, which involves selecting a subspace from a source dataset that best describes the target dataset. This involves using a metric to compute the directional similarity between the source eigenvectors and the target subspace, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of principal directions and variance in the target data, which are common concepts in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve publicly available datasets, which are often used in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
