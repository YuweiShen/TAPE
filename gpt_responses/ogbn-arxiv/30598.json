The use of linear zero-forcing beamforming and joint transmission also suggests the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The large system analysis and random matrix theory used in the paper are also relevant to the categories of matrix analysis (cs.MM) and theoretical computer science (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
