Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely categories. The paper also involves optimization and algorithm design, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses practical implementation and performance, which could be relevant to cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
