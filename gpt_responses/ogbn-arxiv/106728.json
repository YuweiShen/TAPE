The authors use a bijection between factors of Sturmian words and subintervals of the unitary segment, which involves some concepts from information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses classical results of elementary Number Theory, which falls under the category of formal languages (cs.FL). The study of Sturmian words and their properties is closely related to combinatorics on words (cs.CC). Finally, the paper involves some analysis of the properties of Sturmian words, which could be considered as a topic in scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
