Hence, it could be categorized under cs.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with developing an end-to-end model for speech recognition, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Hence, it could be categorized under cs.AI.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although this category may not seem directly relevant, the paper deals with improving the performance of speech recognition models, which could have implications in improving the accessibility of information for individuals with hearing impairments. Hence, it could be categorized under cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
