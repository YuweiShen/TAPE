The paper also discusses the maximum-likelihood union bound, which is a common technique in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper's focus on tie-breaking and its comparison to previous results suggest that it may also fall under the sub-categories of statistical learning (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
