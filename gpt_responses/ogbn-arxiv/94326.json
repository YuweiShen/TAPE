The paper also addresses hardware constraints, which could fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of massive MIMO also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper's focus on performance analysis and optimization could also place it under the sub-category of computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
