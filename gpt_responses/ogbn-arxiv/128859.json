The paper discusses the mathematical significance of the proposed function and compares its performance with other activation functions on benchmark datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). However, since the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed function on image classification tasks, cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. Additionally, since the paper compares the performance of the proposed function with other activation functions, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, since the paper deals with the optimization of DNNs, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
