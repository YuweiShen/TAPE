This technique can be analyzed from an information theory perspective, making cs.IT the most likely category. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on improving the beamforming training process in mmWave communication systems, which is a key aspect of wireless networking. Therefore, cs.NI is a likely category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new technique for beamforming training that involves controlling the beam angles and their coding. Therefore, cs.SY is a possible category. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses a technique for improving the communication range and reducing power consumption in mmWave communication systems, which are important aspects of multimedia applications. Therefore, cs.MM is a possible category. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): Although this category is less likely, the paper does involve coding and signal processing techniques, which are relevant to natural language processing and speech recognition applications. Therefore, cs.CL is a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
