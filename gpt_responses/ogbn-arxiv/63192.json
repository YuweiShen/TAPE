The use of minimax regret as a decision criterion and optimization criterion for the designer also suggests a focus on learning and optimization (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the study of automated optimization of mechanisms suggests a possible connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
