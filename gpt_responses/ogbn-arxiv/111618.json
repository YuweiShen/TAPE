The paper also proposes a VLSI design for the equalizer, which falls under computer architecture (cs.AR) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper discusses the resilience of the equalizer to hardware impairments, which falls under embedded systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper proposes a parallel VLSI architecture, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) as parallel computing is often used in machine learning applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
