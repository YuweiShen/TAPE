The paper discusses scheduling objectives and efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper specifically argues for the superiority of proportional fairness (cs.PF) over dominant resource fairness (DRF), and provides analysis and simulation results to support this claim, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
