This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel framework for processing these images, which involves training a recurrent multiresolution convolutional network in an end-to-end manner. This involves optimizing the network for the classification task at hand, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with the challenges of regularizing noisy classification maps, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses satellite images for its experiments, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
