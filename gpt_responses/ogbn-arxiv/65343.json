LiDAR data is a type of remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to measure distances and create 3D models of objects. Hyperspectral imagery is a type of remote sensing that captures images in many narrow, contiguous spectral bands. The paper uses graph cut to delineate trees from the full 3D LiDAR point cloud, and also makes use of any optical imagery available (hyperspectral imagery in their case). Graph cut is a popular technique in computer vision and image processing for solving optimization problems. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
