The paper also discusses the syntax and semantics of the language, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper mentions experimental validation, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
