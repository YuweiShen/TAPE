The use of erasure codes is common in distributed storage systems, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of Monte Carlo searches, which is a technique commonly used in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of sector-level erasure coding, which is a topic in computer architecture (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the resilience of the codes to disk and sector errors, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR) and system reliability (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
