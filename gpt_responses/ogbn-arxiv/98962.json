The paper also focuses on image classification tasks, which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel regularization framework that is task-specific, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of auto-encoder architectures, which are commonly studied in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in natural language processing tasks, which falls under the subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
