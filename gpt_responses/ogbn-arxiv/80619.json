It also involves the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) to efficiently find an approximate equivalence structure. The paper also mentions the use of communication (cs.MA) in the MDP, and the presented algorithm can be seen as a form of optimization (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
