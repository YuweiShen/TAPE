The use of extended quantifier elimination and virtual substitution suggests a connection to logic and formal methods (cs.LO). The applications to problems in science and engineering suggest a connection to scientific computing (cs.SC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The post-processing procedure for converting answers to standard real numbers suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
