The paper also discusses multitask and multilingual modelling, which are topics that are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions lexical analysis, which is a technique used in computer vision (cs.CV) to extract information from images.
