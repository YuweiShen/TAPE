The proposed method involves using a quality score to estimate detection accuracy and an EM merging unit to resolve overlap ambiguities, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of annotated data sets for training and testing, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
