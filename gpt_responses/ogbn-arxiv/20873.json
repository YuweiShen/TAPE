The paper also mentions the subjectiveness in pain intensity values, which suggests a human-computer interaction aspect, making it relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed approach involves regularization of deep networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of deep neural networks also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a widely-used dataset, which suggests a multimedia aspect (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
