The proposed framework, DynaLog, is designed to analyze the behavior of Android applications and identify malicious ones. \n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes an automated platform for mass analysis and characterization of Android applications. This platform can be useful for software engineers who are developing Android applications and want to ensure that their apps are not vulnerable to malware attacks. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses machine learning techniques to analyze the behavior of Android applications and identify malicious ones. The DynaLog framework leverages existing open source tools to extract and log high-level behaviors, API calls, and critical events that can be used to explore the characteristics of an application. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for analyzing the behavior of Android applications and identifying malicious ones. The DynaLog framework uses machine learning techniques to analyze the dynamic features of Android applications and classify them as either malicious or benign. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of obfuscation techniques by Android malware to avoid detection. The DynaLog framework provides an extensible dynamic analysis platform for detecting Android malware by analyzing the behavior of applications based on an extensive number of dynamic features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
