This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The proposed method also involves exploiting channel properties to distinguish LOS from non-LOS signal paths, which is related to system and control theory (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions using compressed sensing, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
