The use of binary responses and the focus on estimation accuracy suggest that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. Finally, the sequential nature of the learning process and the consideration of query complexity suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
