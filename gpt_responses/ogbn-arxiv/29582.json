The authors also use trajectory optimizers like Iterative LQR and Differential Dynamic Programming to solve continuous control tasks. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the application of the proposed method to learn agile walking and turning policies for quadruped locomotion, which successfully transfer from simulation to actual hardware. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of trajectory optimizers to solve continuous control tasks and the application of the proposed method to learn agile walking and turning policies for quadruped locomotion. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for optimization and discusses its application to solve continuous control tasks. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the use of trajectory optimizers to solve continuous control tasks and the application of the proposed method to learn agile walking and turning policies for quadruped locomotion."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
