The paper also mentions the use of geometrical representation and path planning, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of constraints and traffic scenarios, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a predictive algorithm, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
