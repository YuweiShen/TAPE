The paper also compares the proposed approach with deep neural networks, which are widely used in computer vision and natural language processing, indicating that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
