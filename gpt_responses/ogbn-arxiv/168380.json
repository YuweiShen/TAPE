The paper proposes a new permutation-based model for crowd labeled data and introduces a new error metric for comparing different estimators. The paper also derives optimal rates of convergence for the proposed model and proposes a computationally-efficient method for estimation. These topics are closely related to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
