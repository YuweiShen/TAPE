The paper proposes a novel approach that uses a Causal And-Or Graph (C-AOG) to represent the causal-effect relations between an object's visibility fluents and its activities, and develops a probabilistic graph model to jointly reason the visibility fluent change and track humans in videos. This approach involves machine learning and probabilistic reasoning, which are common topics in the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of tracking humans in crowded scenes, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer security (cs.CR) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
