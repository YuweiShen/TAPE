Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves training neural networks, which could fall under cs.SD (Sound). Additionally, the paper proposes a practical training scheme, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves information fusion, which could be related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
