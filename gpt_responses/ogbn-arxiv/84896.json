The paper also discusses stochastic geometry analysis, which is a common technique used in information theory (cs.IT). The use of multiple base stations for transmission is a system-level approach to improving network performance, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of small base stations, which are a key component of mobile and wireless communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the probability of successful transmission, which is a key concern in the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
