The use of MRC-SIC receivers and the analysis of the ASINR also suggest the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also discusses optimization and nonconvex problems, which are relevant to the Computation and Language (cs.COMM) sub-category. Finally, the use of geometric programming for solving the optimization problem suggests the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
