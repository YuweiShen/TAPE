This involves using a deep neural network to transform the data and back-propagating through the tree to learn good representations for kNN methods. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). However, given the focus on learning representations and the use of deep neural networks, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.CV and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
