The paper proposes a platform based on phonological speech vocoding for examining relations between phonology and speech processing, which falls under the scope of cs.CL.\n\n2. cs.SD (Sound): The paper focuses on speech signal processing and phonology, which are both related to sound. Therefore, cs.SD is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a platform for speech signal processing based on phonological speech vocoding. Therefore, cs.SI is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.LG (Learning): The paper discusses an experimental phonological parametric text-to-speech (TTS) system that is trained in an unsupervised manner. This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is covered by cs.LG.\n\n5. cs.SD (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a platform for speech signal processing based on phonological speech vocoding, which can be seen as a control system for speech signals. Therefore, cs.SD is another possible sub-category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
