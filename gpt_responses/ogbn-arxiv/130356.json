This involves understanding user workflows and providing multi-granularity visualizations. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also deals with machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning, which are core topics in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the search space and efficiency of AutoML, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
