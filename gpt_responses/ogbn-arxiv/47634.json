The paper also discusses the use of log-softmax in training deterministic neural networks, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper provides a computer vision application example, indicating that it may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the generalization of the informative-theoretic perspective to neural networks with stochasticity, which suggests that it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the information-theoretic view, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
