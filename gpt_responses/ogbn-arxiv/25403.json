The use of sparse channel estimation techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed decoding approach, which could be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
