This suggests a strong connection to game theory, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with spectrum allocation and scheduling in wireless networks, which is a core topic in networking and internet architecture. This makes cs.NI a likely sub-category as well.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions the physical model of interference based on SINR, which is a key concept in information theory. This suggests a possible connection to cs.IT.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper presents algorithms for implementing local spectrum redistribution, which involves distributed decision-making and coordination among secondary users. This suggests a possible connection to cs.DC.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions randomized mechanisms, which are commonly used in machine learning. This suggests a possible connection to cs.LG as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
