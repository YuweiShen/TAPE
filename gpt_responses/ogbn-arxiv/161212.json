The paper also involves the use of error-correcting codes, which is a topic studied in information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs), which is a topic studied in computational complexity theory (cs.CR) and theoretical computer science (cs.DM).
