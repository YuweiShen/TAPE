Specifically, the paper focuses on the application of these concepts to video game environments, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). However, the primary focus is on the development and evaluation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests a stronger connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting further supports the connection to machine learning and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
