The use of illumination models and textures also suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as possible sub-categories. The specific use of Wang tiles and hash functions for tiling also suggests computational geometry (cs.CG) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the simplicity and ease of implementation of the algorithm suggests machine learning (cs.LG) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
