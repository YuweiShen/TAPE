The paper focuses on the parameterization of estimated distributions, which is a common topic in deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm uses neural networks, which are a common tool in deep learning (cs.DL). The experiments are conducted on Atari games, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
