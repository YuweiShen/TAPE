The use of ontologies also relates to database systems (cs.DB). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the matching systems aim to find relevant information across different ontologies. The paper also mentions multilingual issues, which falls under computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the ability to deal with real-world cases involves software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
