The paper focuses on developing a probabilistic, relational planning rule representation that models noisy, nondeterministic action effects. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on developing intelligent agents that can learn and reason about the world. The focus on developing agents that can learn to act in complex worlds suggests that this paper is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on developing algorithms that can learn from data. The learning algorithm developed in this paper suggests that it is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers research on developing robots that can interact with the world. The focus on developing agents that can act in complex worlds suggests that this paper is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers research on developing systems that can be controlled and optimized. The focus on developing agents that can act in complex worlds suggests that this paper is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category covers research on developing programming languages and tools for building software systems. The focus on developing a probabilistic, relational planning rule representation suggests that"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
