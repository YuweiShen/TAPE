This involves formulating an optimization problem, proposing an approach to model memory retention, and discussing the complexity of the problem. The proposed approach is demonstrated on three publicly available datasets and by simulating oracles with various memory strengths. The paper emphasizes the contributions of the work in human-centered mobile health settings and for elderly with cognitive impairments. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
