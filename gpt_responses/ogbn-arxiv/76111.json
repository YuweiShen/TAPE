The paper also proposes a new Active Learning (AL) framework for incorporating unlabeled or partially labeled data into the model learning, which falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also introduces a Self-supervised Sample Mining (SSM) process, which involves discovering and pseudo-labeling reliable region proposals, and this process can be considered as a form of unsupervised learning, which is a topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also evaluates its proposed framework on two public benchmarks, which falls under the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on enhancing the object detector can be considered as a topic in the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
