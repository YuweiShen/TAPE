The use of active learning and hierarchical agglomerative segmentation also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the mention of neural tissue and 3D electron microscopy images suggests a possible connection to neuroscience (cs.NE) and medical imaging (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
