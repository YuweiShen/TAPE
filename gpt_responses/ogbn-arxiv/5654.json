Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses video compression, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper mentions the HEVC standard, which is related to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also deals with noise reduction, which is related to cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing). Finally, the paper uses the ADMM technique, which is related to cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
