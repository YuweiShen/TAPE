This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of capsule networks, which is a relatively new and emerging area of research in deep learning, making it likely to fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
