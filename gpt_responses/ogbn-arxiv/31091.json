This involves leveraging domain-specific constraint information and semi-supervised learning to group user reviews into multiple fine-grained clusters concerning similar users' requests and automatically localizing potential change files to accommodate the users' requests. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques such as clustering and semi-supervised learning, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper also discusses the importance of user feedback in mobile app development, which could make it relevant to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
