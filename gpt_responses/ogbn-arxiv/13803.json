Specifically, the paper proposes a modification to the Adam optimizer, which is a popular adaptive gradient method used for training DNNs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of DNN training. Additionally, the paper mentions theoretical convergence analysis, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which could potentially place it in the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) if the experiments involve novel algorithmic techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
