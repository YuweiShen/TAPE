The proposed algorithm involves learning a coding scheme, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of sparse representation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The empirical studies involve facial databases, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM).
