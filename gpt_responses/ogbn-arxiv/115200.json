The use of deep learning also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of image sequences, which could suggest it belongs to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the automatic extraction of facial action points, which could suggest it belongs to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with facial expression recognition, which is a common topic in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
