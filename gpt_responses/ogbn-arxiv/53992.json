The proposed model is based on discriminative clustering and integrates different types of supervision as constraints on the optimization. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with machine learning and optimization, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments on datasets, which suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing, as it mentions video-level class labels, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
