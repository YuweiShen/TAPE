The paper discusses various security threats and proposes defense mechanisms against them. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a framework that leverages cellular networks and Fog computing for securing CPS. The paper discusses the role of Fog networks in providing computational resources and coordination for securing CPS. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) in various domains such as health, safety, transportation, and education. The paper proposes a framework for securing CPS that leverages cellular networks and Fog computing. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a framework that leverages Fog computing for securing Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). The paper discusses the role of Fog networks in providing computational resources and coordination for securing CPS. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework for securing Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) that leverages cellular networks and Fog computing. The paper discusses the design and implementation of the proposed framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
