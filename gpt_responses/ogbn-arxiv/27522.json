The algorithm presented in the paper involves manipulating binary strings, which is a common theme in formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The use of bubble languages, a specific class of binary languages, is also a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper presents an algorithm for exhaustively listing the prefix normal words, which is a problem in combinatorics (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the generation of combinatorial objects, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
