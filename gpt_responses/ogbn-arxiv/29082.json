The use of evolutionary strategies and gradient estimators suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG), \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI), and \"Robotics\" (cs.RO). The focus on reward functions and exploration of parameter space suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
