The paper proposes a method for modifying the form of the return function to enhance learning towards the optimal policy. This involves using a general mathematical form for the return function and employing meta-learning to learn the optimal return function in an end-to-end manner. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
