The focus of the paper is on optimizing the weights and quantizer of ternary neural networks, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of back-propagation training, which is a common technique in neural networks and falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of model size and computational cost, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
