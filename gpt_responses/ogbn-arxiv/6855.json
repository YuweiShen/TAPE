This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper involves joint optimization of resource allocation and CoMP selection to maximize the capacity for any target UE group of interest. This requires information theory concepts such as channel capacity and rate allocation. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The coordination of distributed RRHs by baseband units (BBUs) in the cloud involves control and optimization of the system. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The proposed algorithm enables network-level performance evaluation for quality of experience, which is related to multimedia applications. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper involves distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) coordinated by baseband units (BBUs) in the cloud, which requires distributed computing concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
