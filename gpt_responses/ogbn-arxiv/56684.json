The paper also discusses the optimization landscape induced by dropout, which is relevant to the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper's findings on the equalization of weight vectors could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Finally, the paper's characterization of the optimization landscape could be relevant to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
