This involves performing spectral-spatial pixel characterization and feature dimensionality reduction iteratively and successively. Given this, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category, as it deals with image classification. Additionally, the paper involves learning representations in a coarse-to-fine manner, which is a common approach in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves regularization, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also involves information retrieval, as it deals with extracting relevant information from hyperspectral images (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves multimedia analysis, as it deals with analyzing hyperspectral images (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
