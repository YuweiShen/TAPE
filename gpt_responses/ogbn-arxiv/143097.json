The use of L0 optimization and orthogonal matching pursuit to obtain sparse packets suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The presence of packet dropouts and the need for stability in the control loop may also make the paper relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
