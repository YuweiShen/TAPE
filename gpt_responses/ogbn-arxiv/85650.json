The paper presents an extension to the CTBN framework that allows for a much richer class of transition duration distributions, known as phase distributions. The paper also presents experimental results on a real data set. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
