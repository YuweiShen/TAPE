The paper also mentions the use of quantization tables, which are commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The proposed method involves the use of a dual-domain correction unit, which is a type of neural network architecture that falls under the category of deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of priors in the discrete cosine transform domain, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and information theory (cs.IT). Overall, the paper covers a range of topics that could potentially fall under these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
