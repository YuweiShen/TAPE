The paper also mentions the use of an interval invariant generator, which is commonly used in program analysis and software engineering. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and cs.ET (Emerging Technologies)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
