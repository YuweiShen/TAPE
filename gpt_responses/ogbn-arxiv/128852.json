This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the application of the proposed method is in the medical field (cs.MED), and the use of attention networks and statistical fusion techniques also suggests a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
