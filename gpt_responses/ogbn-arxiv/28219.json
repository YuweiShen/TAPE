The codes are associated with non-degenerate quadratic forms, which are also studied in computer science, particularly in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves studying subspaces and their dual spaces, which are topics in linear algebra and coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents some interesting results, which could potentially be of interest to the machine learning community (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
