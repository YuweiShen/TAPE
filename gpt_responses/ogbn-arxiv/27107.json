The paper also discusses the use of knowledge distillation, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to pruning that involves a budget-aware objective function, which could potentially fall under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
