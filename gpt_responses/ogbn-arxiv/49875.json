The paper also discusses image compression techniques, which can be related to information theory (cs.IT) and data compression (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes a new compression framework using deep learning, which can be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
