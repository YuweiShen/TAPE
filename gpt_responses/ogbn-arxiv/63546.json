The paper proposes a new training objective for non-autoregressive translation models, which involves calculating the Bag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference sentence. This approach involves optimizing a differentiable objective function, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper may involve neural network architectures and optimization techniques, which could place it under the sub-categories of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
