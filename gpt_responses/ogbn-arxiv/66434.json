Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of nonlinear kinetics, which is relevant to cs.CE (Cellular Automata and Discrete Complex Systems) and cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering). The mention of chemical feasibility suggests relevance to cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) and cs.BM (Biomolecules and Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
