The focus is on the impact of noisy cooperation and feedback on the achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs) of these networks, which falls under the network information theory (NI) subfield. The paper also considers full-duplex transmission, which is a topic in the signal processing (SI) subfield. The use of feedback and cooperation also involves aspects of control engineering (CE) and multimedia (MM) communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
