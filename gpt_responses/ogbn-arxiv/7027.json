It also involves the use of mathematical methods (MM) such as wavelet transforms. Additionally, it employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as GANs and age estimation networks. Finally, it involves graphics (GR) in terms of generating realistic facial images. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.MM, cs.AI, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
