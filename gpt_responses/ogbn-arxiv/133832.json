This is relevant to database systems that use PCM as a storage medium. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system-level solution to improve the performance and energy efficiency of PCM-based memory systems. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the bandwidth overhead of PCM and proposes a solution to reduce it by migrating pages to DRAM. This is relevant to distributed and parallel computing systems that use PCM as a main memory technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
