The proposed method involves the use of Fourier transform and multi-scale fractal dimension, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The potential applications of the proposed method include security systems and physical therapy, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
