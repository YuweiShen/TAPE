Fountain codes are typically studied in the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also analyzes the decoding complexity and overhead, which are topics that fall under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses simulation results, which could fall under the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
