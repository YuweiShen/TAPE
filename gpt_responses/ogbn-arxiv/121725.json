The paper also introduces a new technique called precoder index modulation, which involves the use of precoder matrices, and is related to signal processing and system design, which are studied in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of spatial modulation, which is related to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and is studied in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of antenna indices, which is related to networked and distributed systems, and is studied in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
