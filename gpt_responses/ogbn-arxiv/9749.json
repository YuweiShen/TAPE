Additionally, the paper mentions the use of RNN-based models, which suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of high-level knowledge about the progress of a task, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
