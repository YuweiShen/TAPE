The paper proposes a novel framework for uncertainty-based class imbalance learning that utilizes Bayesian uncertainty estimates to learn more robust features and generalizable classifiers. The paper presents experimental results on six benchmark datasets for face verification, attribute prediction, digit/object classification, and skin lesion detection. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
