The control scheme proposed in the paper involves the use of adaptive gain and sliding mode control, which are common techniques in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of mathematical models and simulations, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper specifically mentions civil applications such as surveying and infrastructure assessment, which falls under the field of civil engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
