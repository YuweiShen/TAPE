The paper also discusses the optimality of these trajectories, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The use of submodularity assumptions for repeated measurements suggests a control systems perspective (cs.SY), and the decay of information over time suggests an information theory perspective (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
