The paper also studies the parameterized complexity of the problem for various choices of parameters. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
