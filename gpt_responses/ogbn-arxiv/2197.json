The paper also mentions the use of heuristic evaluations, which is a common topic in game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper proposes a new technique for using heuristic evaluations in MCTS, which could be considered a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of minimax values, which is a common topic in programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LG, cs.PL, and cs.DS, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
