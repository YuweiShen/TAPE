Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, which are common in the sub-categories of cs.SD (Sound) and cs.SI (Speech Recognition and Synthesis). The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for classification suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the focus on Arabic dialects indicates a potential fit for cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
