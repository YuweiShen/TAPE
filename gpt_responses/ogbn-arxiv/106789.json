The use of Poisson cluster process (PCP) also suggests a statistical approach, which is relevant to cs.ST (statistics) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms). However, since the focus is on wireless communication systems, we prioritize cs.IT, cs.NI, and cs.SI as the most likely categories. The use of mathematical models and numerical simulations also suggests a strong emphasis on theoretical analysis, which is consistent with cs.IT and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
