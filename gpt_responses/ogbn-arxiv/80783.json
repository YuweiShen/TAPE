The paper specifically focuses on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation for this problem, which is a common approach in control theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as these sub-categories also deal with control and decision-making problems. The paper also involves the use of a Kalman-like estimator, which is a common tool in signal processing, suggesting that cs.IT (Information Theory) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes lower complexity strategies, which may involve optimization techniques, suggesting that cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
