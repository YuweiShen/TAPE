This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the optimization of transmission power control function at the base station, which is a control systems problem (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas also involves signal processing and communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the asymptotic performance of the system, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
