The paper discusses a framework for implementing regulatory compliance in requirements engineering, which is a key concern in software development. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Regulatory compliance often involves security and privacy concerns, which are key topics in the field of cryptography and security. The paper discusses the compliance problem, which involves verifying that requirements meet regulatory standards, and this verification process may involve security and privacy considerations. \n\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper discusses testable hypotheses about how compliance of requirements is verified, which may involve the use of artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning or natural language processing. \n\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - As mentioned above, the paper may involve the use of machine learning techniques to verify compliance of requirements. \n\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper presents a requirements engineering framework that implements its principles, which may involve the use of programming languages to specify and verify compliance of requirements."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
