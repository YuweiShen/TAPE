The proposed method, parameterized principal component analysis (PPCA), is a novel approach that models data with linear subspaces that change continuously according to the extra parameter of contextual information. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), statistics (cs.ST), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
