This falls under the area of natural language processing and text classification, which is a subfield of cs.CL.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with mining social media messages (tweets) for health and drug related information. This falls under the area of social network analysis and information retrieval, which is a subfield of cs.SI.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves identifying relevant information (mentions of personal intake of medicine) from a large corpus of text (tweets). This falls under the area of information retrieval, which is a subfield of cs.IR.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper has direct uses in the areas of psychology, health informatics, pharmacovigilance and affective computing for tracking moods, emotions and sentiments of patients expressing intake of medicine in social media. This falls under the area of computers and society, which is a subfield of cs.CY.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves training a stacked ensemble of shallow convolutional neural network models for the prediction task.
