The use of game theory to formulate non-cooperative games for utility maximization suggests that the paper also belongs to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The consideration of multiuser MIMO systems with multiple antennas for each terminal suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The investigation of the use of non-linear interference cancellation at the receiver suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the cross-layer approach to resource allocation suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
