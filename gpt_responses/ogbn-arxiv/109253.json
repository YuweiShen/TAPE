The focus on safety constraints and risk management also suggests a connection to robotics and control theory (cs.RO, cs.SY). Finally, the two simulated applications mentioned in the abstract - spoken dialogue and autonomous driving - suggest a potential connection to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
