The focus is on improving the receiver performance with diversity support, which involves equalization and interference suppression, making it relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the design of a low-complexity channel shortening filter, which can be optimized using mutual information lower bound (MILB), making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
