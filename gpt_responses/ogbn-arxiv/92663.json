The use of deep learning techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of multi-stage local layers suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of the back-propagation algorithm with the dropout strategy suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
