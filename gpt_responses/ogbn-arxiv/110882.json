The paper specifically explores the properties of sentence vectors in the context of automatic summarization, which falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of artificial neural networks also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of vector semantics to identify and correct gaps in the document, which could be relevant to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper identifies specific dimensions of sentence embeddings that are linked to effective summaries, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
