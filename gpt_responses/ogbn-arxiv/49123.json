Additionally, the paper discusses the use of evolutionary algorithms for this optimization, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments are conducted on image datasets, specifically CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the potential for these optimized activation functions to improve performance on various tasks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
