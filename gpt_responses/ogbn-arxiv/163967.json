This falls under the domain of natural language processing and speech recognition, which is a subfield of cs.CL.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new comprehensive, automatic, real-time multimodal pronunciation training system that benefits from powerful artificial intelligence techniques. This involves the use of deep learning algorithms, which is a subfield of cs.LG.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the use of ultrasound-enhanced multimodal method for visualizing tongue movements of a language learner overlaid on the face-side of the speaker's head. This involves the use of computer vision techniques, which is a subfield of cs.CV.\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper focuses on pronunciation teaching and learning, which is related to sound processing. This falls under the domain of cs.SD.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed system for several language courses via a blended learning paradigm at the university level. This involves the interaction between humans and computers, which is a subfield of cs.HC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
