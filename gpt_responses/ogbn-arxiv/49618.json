This falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses developing algorithms for identifying similar programs, aligning correct and incorrect programs, and repairing incorrect programs, which are related to programming languages (cs.PL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of student submissions and the goal of automating feedback generation also suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the context of large or MOOC-scale introductory programming courses, indicating a potential connection to computer science education (cs.EDU)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
