The study also involves a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art networks (cs.LG) and the interpretation of the learned representations in relation to art history concepts (cs.HC). Finally, the paper deals with a large dataset of images (cs.MM) and discusses the quantitative confirmation of art historian observations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
