The paper also discusses model compression techniques, which are often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The use of smaller DNN architectures may also be relevant to research on neural engineering (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
