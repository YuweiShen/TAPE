This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) (since the paper also discusses adversarial settings). Among these, cs.CL and cs.CV are the most likely categories, as the paper focuses on biases in textual and visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
