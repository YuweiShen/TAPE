This topic falls under the scope of digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the size and characterization of the documents to be included in the library, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a model for a network of institutions to physically archive the digital documents, which could be relevant to cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
