It also involves the study of temporal evolution and cultural dimensions of the articles (cs.SI), as well as the comparison of article snapshots (cs.IR). The use of a web-based user interface suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and the visualization of data (cs.DL). Finally, the study of interlingual article similarity may also involve computational linguistics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
