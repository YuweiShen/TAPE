The paper proposes an interference-aware RZF precoding scheme and analyzes its rate performance. This involves the use of channel state information and large-scale random matrix theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
