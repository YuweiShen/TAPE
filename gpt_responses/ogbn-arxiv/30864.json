The use of double hashing and second moment methods suggests a focus on algorithms and complexity, which are studied in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) and Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. The mention of thresholds and quasi-random models suggests a connection to graph theory, which is studied in the Graph Theory (cs.GT) sub-category.
