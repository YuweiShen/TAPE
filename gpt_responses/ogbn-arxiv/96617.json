The use of clause groups and the implementation details suggest that the paper may also belong to programming languages (PL) and data structures (DS) categories. Finally, the integration of DepQBF in other tools and the reporting of experiments suggest that the paper may also belong to software engineering (SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
