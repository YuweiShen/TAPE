This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also proposes techniques to avoid cache hit and prolong overall latency, which could be considered as system optimization (cs.SI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the testing on BIND servers involves software engineering (cs.SE) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
