Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.MM (Multimedia) are all possible sub-categories that this paper could belong to. However, given that the paper focuses on the development of a novel convex relaxation method for the problem, cs.IT and cs.SP are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also provides an ADMM implementation and numerical experiments, which could make cs.MM a possible sub-category as well. Finally, the use of Rademacher complexity estimates suggests that cs.LG could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
