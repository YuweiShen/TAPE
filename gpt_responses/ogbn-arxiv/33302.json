Additionally, the paper explores the use of these architectures in partially observable environments, which is a problem commonly studied in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
