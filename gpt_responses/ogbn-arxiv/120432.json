Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) are likely sub-categories. The paper also uses techniques from additive set theory, which suggests that cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) may be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper involves linear maps and norm bounds, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
