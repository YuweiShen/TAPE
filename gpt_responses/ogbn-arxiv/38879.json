The paper also discusses the potential deployment of deep learning applications on mobile devices, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a modeling tool to estimate the resource requirements of CNNs on mobile devices, which could fall under computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
