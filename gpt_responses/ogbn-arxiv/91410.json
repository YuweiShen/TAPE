The problem is also related to logic and computability theory (cs.LO) since it involves proving undecidability. The paper uses techniques from discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.CC) to prove its results. Finally, the paper also touches upon the topic of geometric topology (cs.GT) since it deals with tiling in the hyperbolic plane."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
