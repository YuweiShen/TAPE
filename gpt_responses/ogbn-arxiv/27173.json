The use of Turing degrees and the study of growth rates suggest a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), and logic (cs.LO). The focus on subshifts and their properties suggests a connection to dynamical systems (cs.DS) and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
