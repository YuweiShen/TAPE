The paper specifically focuses on active learning for regression, which is a subfield of ML. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing affective data, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions using computer vision techniques for affect estimation, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper mentions the VAM corpus, which is a dataset of audio-visual affective data, indicating that the paper could also fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
