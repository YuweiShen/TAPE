The paper specifically focuses on the hardware implementation of these accelerators, which could fall under the categories of Computer Architecture (cs.AR) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The use of systolic arrays for matrix multiplication is a common technique in digital signal processing, which could also place this paper in the category of Embedded Systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper deals with the impact of permanent faults on the accelerator, which could fall under the category of Dependable and Secure Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
