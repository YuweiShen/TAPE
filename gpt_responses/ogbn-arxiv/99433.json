The paper proposes a new algorithm for this problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm is based on optimization techniques, which suggests that it may also be relevant to researchers in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also includes experiments on face recognition and music source separation, which suggests that it may be relevant to researchers in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
