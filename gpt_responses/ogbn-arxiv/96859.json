It may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category as it deals with network bandwidth and optimization. Information Theory (cs.IT) is another possible category as the paper formulates bitrate adaptation as a utility maximization problem. Control Systems (cs.SY) is also a possible category as the paper devises an online control algorithm. Finally, Physics and Society (cs.PF) is a less likely category as it deals with the impact of the work on real-world video players and the evolving DASH standard."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
