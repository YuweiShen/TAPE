The approach involves continual learning of a sequence of tasks represented as graphs, with intra- and inter-task correlations preserved via message-passing and history transition. The use of Bayesian Graph Neural Networks and Bayes by Backprop strategy further enhances the model's performance. Given these factors, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
