The paper focuses on the performance assessment of the proposed finger replacement schemes operating over independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) faded paths. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking). Additionally, the paper also discusses diversity channels, joint PDF, order statistics, and i.n.d fading channels, which are related to the sub-categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
