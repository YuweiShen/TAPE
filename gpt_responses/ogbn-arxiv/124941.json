However, the paper also involves image processing (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) techniques for registration accuracy. Additionally, the paper discusses the influence of tuning parameters on the performance of outlier filters, which relates to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
