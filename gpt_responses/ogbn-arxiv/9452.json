The use of autocorrelation analysis suggests that the paper may be related to image processing and computer vision, which are covered by cs.CV. The use of expansion coefficients and covariance matrices suggests that the paper may also be related to machine learning and statistics, which are covered by cs.LG and cs.NE.
