The paper discusses the design of the robots and their potential applications in various scenarios. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses how the shape-changing swarm robots can act as tangible controllers and provide physical affordances. The paper also discusses the potential of this type of interface for the future of ubiquitous and distributed shape-changing interfaces. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of the shape-changing swarm robots and their ability to change their shape using small linear actuators. The paper also discusses the potential applications of the robots in various scenarios. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses how the shape-changing swarm robots can visualize data and actuate objects. \n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper discusses the swarm of self-transformable robots and their ability to change their configuration collectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
