The method involves using entropy to evaluate the Pareto-frontier in the output space, which could also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and data mining (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper includes numerical experiments on real-world datasets, which suggests a potential application in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
