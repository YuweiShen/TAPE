This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a CNN for learning the structure of the cracks from raw images suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with the problem of imbalanced data, which suggests that it may belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of a strategy for modifying the ratio of positive to negative samples suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
