This involves considering multiple protected variables together, which makes the problem more challenging. The method uses a well-cited discrimination metric and adapts it to allow the specification of explanatory variables. The paper also models the post-processing of predictions problem as a nonlinear optimization problem. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
