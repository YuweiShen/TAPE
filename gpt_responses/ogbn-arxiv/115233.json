This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Symbolic Computation (cs.SC). Additionally, the paper involves the computation of determinants of matrices, which falls under the sub-category of Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Matrix Analysis (cs.MS). The paper also discusses the impact of software errors on mathematical research, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
