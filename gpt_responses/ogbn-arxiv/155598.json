The proposed approach involves adding an unsupervised loss term to filter out noisy labels while still learning from the corresponding samples. This approach is evaluated on common classification tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
