Therefore, it is highly likely that this paper belongs to the computer vision sub-category.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves recognizing sign language, which is a form of language. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the computation and language sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves training a special-purpose signing hand detector and exploring different sequence models for decoding the fingerspelled letter sequence. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the machine learning sub-category.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with recognizing sign language, which is a form of communication between humans. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the human-computer interaction sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves analyzing videos to recognize American Sign Language fingerspelling. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
