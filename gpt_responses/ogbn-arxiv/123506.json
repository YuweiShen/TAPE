This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of technology (such as detectors) to detect deception, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories.
