This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of neural networks for automated obstruction level detection also falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves training a neural network for a specific task, which falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves gathering a database of videos and adapting them to generate useful frames for the model, which could be considered as an information retrieval task, making cs.IR a possible sub-category. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves the use of neural networks, making cs.NE a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
