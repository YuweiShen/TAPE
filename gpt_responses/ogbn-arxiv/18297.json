Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also makes use of spectral techniques, which suggests cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves optimization and approximation algorithms, which could fall under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
