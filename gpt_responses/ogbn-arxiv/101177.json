The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach that uses perception-related basic knowledge and driving knowledge stepwise to train the model. This approach involves using segmentation maps and depth maps to tackle easier driving-related perception problems before generating final control commands for difficult driving tasks. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses segmentation maps and depth maps to improve the perception ability of the driving model. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new deep learning approach to improve the generalization and accident explanation ability of self-driving cars. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on developing a driving model for self-driving cars. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach to train the driving model. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper aims to improve the performance and safety of self-driving cars."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
