The use of HOG based detector and covariance matrices for modeling similarity among patches of persons extracted from video frames suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach that exploits game theoretic notions to solve the problem of multi-target tracking. This suggests that the paper belongs to the artificial intelligence sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a graph transduction approach that involves learning from labeled and unlabeled data to estimate the target association in a sequence of frames. This suggests that the paper belongs to the machine learning sub-category. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography or security, but the problem of multi-target tracking in video surveillance datasets has implications for security and surveillance applications. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The use of game theoretic notions to model the problem of multi-target tracking suggests that the paper may belong to the social and information networks sub-category. However, the focus of the paper is more on computer vision and machine learning aspects, so this sub-category is less likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
