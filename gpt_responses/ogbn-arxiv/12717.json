The paper proposes a new method for sampling users of online social networks by exploiting the graphs induced by different relations between users. This involves designing a computationally efficient way to perform multigraph sampling. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science). Other possible sub-categories include cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
