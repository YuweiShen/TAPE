This involves processing video recordings of the user's face and extracting feature vectors, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.SD (Sound): Although the proposed system is primarily based on visual speech recognition, it may also involve processing audio signals to some extent. Therefore, the paper could potentially fall under the sub-category of sound (cs.SD). \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper aims to increase security by proposing a new authentication method based on visual passwords. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed system involves processing video recordings of the user's face, which is a form of multimedia data. Therefore, the paper could potentially fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves processing speech signals to extract feature vectors, which could potentially fall under the domain of computation and language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
