The use of regularization strategies and the optimization of hyperparameters are typical of machine learning and statistical inference, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with optimization techniques, which could place it in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The fact that the paper deals with multivariable systems and coupling between input-output channels suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper deals with the estimation of impulse responses, which is a topic related to information theory, suggesting that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
