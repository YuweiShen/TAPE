The paper discusses the challenges of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. The proposed method relaxes the metricity assumption inherent in previous work and models multiple localized notions of 'relatedness,' so as to uncover ways in which related items should be systematically similar, and systematically different. The paper also demonstrates that richer notions of compatibility can be learned that go beyond similarity, and that the model can make effective recommendations of heterogeneous content. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
