The paper specifically focuses on the computation of homotopy classes of maps between two spaces, which is a problem in computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also uses techniques from discrete Morse theory, which is a subfield of combinatorial geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper deals with homology, which is a fundamental concept in algebraic topology and is closely related to the study of simplicial complexes (cs.DM). The paper also mentions Postnikov systems, which are a tool for studying homotopy groups and are related to the field of geometric topology (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses algorithms for computing homotopy groups, which is a problem in computational topology (cs.SD, cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
