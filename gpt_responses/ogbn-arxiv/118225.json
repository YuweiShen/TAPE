The paper proposes a new training regime for improving the performance of DCNN based models, which involves loss functions and modeling of fixations, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). The paper also mentions experiments on discriminative regions, which suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
