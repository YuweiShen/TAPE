Therefore, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for deferring message content binding, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely sub-category. The use of HTML code snippets and external images also implies a possible connection to database (DB) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which could place the paper in cs.DB and cs.CL (Computation and Language), respectively. Finally, the paper mentions the use of multimedia (MM) content in emails, which could make cs.MM (Multimedia) a relevant sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
