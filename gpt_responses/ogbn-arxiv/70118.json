Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new framework for multivariate scoring functions using deep neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of textual features in the evaluation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of image features in the evaluation, which could relate to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of deep neural networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
