This aligns with the focus of cs.SE on improving software development practices and tools. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper specifically mentions the use of the Python programming language, which falls under the scope of cs.PL. \n- cs.CY (Computational Geometry): Although not directly related to computational geometry, the paper does involve the use of mathematical calculations and testing of spreadsheet calculations, which could potentially fall under the scope of cs.CY. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): While not directly related to cryptography and security, the paper does address the issue of mitigating risk in spreadsheet models, which could be relevant to the concerns of cs.CR. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the development of audit tools to test and audit spreadsheet calculations, which could potentially involve the use of databases to store and manage the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
