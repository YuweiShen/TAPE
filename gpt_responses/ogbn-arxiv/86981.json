The paper discusses different counting schemes for assigning weights to links in these networks, and proposes a new scheme for fractional counting. The paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), social and information networks (cs.SI), information retrieval (cs.IR), software engineering (cs.SD), and cryptography and security (cs.CY). However, given the focus on bibliometric networks, cs.DL and cs.SI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
