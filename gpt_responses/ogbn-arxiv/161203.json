The use of structured output optimization and metric learning also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the use of geometric verification and the evaluation of the proposed method on video datasets suggest that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
