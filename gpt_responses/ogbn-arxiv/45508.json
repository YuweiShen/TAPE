This is a key area of research in social and information networks. \n2. cs.SOC (Computational Social Science) - The paper analyzes the control mechanism of influential agents in shaping the beliefs of non-influential agents, which is a topic of interest in computational social science. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper develops mechanisms by which influential agents can lead receiving agents to adopt certain beliefs, which is a key area of research in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the control of beliefs of non-influential agents by influential agents, which can be seen as a form of machine learning. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper develops design procedures for influential agents to drive other agents to endorse particular beliefs, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
