The paper also discusses the use of limited feedback schemes for practical deployment, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of directional beams and user region geometries also suggests a focus on millimeter wave (cs.MM) and possibly artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for optimizing the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
