This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also proposes a multi-modal policy that utilizes both ground and aerial views, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper further discusses the transfer learning paradigm, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SD). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.LG, followed by cs.RO and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
