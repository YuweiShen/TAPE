The use of neural models and TensorFlow suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The incorporation of prior knowledge and information extraction from text suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL) and databases (cs.DB). The use of GPUs for large knowledge bases suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
