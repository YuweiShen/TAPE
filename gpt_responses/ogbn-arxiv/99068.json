The paper also proposes a new optimization procedure, which involves minimizing the loss over a worst-case mixture of topics, which is related to robust optimization (cs.LG). The approach also involves training a model that performs well over a wide range of potential test distributions, which is related to machine learning (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new metric, called topic conditional value at risk (topic CVaR), which is related to risk management and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
