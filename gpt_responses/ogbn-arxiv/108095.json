The use of submodular functions is common in machine learning and optimization, which suggests that cs.LG and cs.AI are likely categories. The paper also discusses the use of specialized exchange capacity subroutines, which is a topic that is relevant to algorithms and data structures, suggesting that cs.DS is another likely category. The paper also mentions the use of an auxiliary graph, which is a common technique in information theory and network optimization, suggesting that cs.IT and cs.SI are also possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
