The paper also proposes and evaluates generic behaviour similarity measures, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The use of sensors and effectors to characterize group-level behaviour suggests a focus on control systems and cybernetics (cs.SY). The evaluation of the proposed measures in tasks such as aggregation and resource sharing suggests a focus on multi-agent systems and distributed algorithms (cs.MA). Finally, the comparison of the proposed measures to task-specific measures involves statistical analysis and machine learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
