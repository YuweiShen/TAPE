Therefore, cs.NI is a possible sub-category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of sparsity as a prior for signal reconstruction, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Spectrum sensing is an important aspect of multimedia communication, and the paper's focus on wideband spectrum sensing could potentially fall under cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
