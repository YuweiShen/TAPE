The use of few bends and crossings suggests that the paper may also be related to graph drawing (cs.GT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The algorithms and techniques used to achieve the results may involve data structures (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
