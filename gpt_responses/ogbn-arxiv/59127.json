Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also discusses techniques for data preprocessing and substring filtering, which are commonly used in database systems, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper mentions the representation of documents with binary codes, which is a common practice in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) for semantic representation learning. Finally, the paper discusses the speed-ups achieved by the proposed approach, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
