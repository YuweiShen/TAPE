It may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories as these fields are closely related to computer vision. Additionally, the paper proposes a new network architecture, which may fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which is commonly used in Multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
