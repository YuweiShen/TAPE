The use of Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ClassRBM) and the proposed Dropping method are both related to the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of image analysis techniques (cs.CV) to identify relevant inputs (symptoms) in illness reappearance. The use of probabilistic frameworks (cs.AI) and the experimentation with real-life datasets (cs.CC) also suggest these categories as likely candidates. Finally, the use of neural networks (cs.NE) in the proposed methods further supports the inclusion of this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
