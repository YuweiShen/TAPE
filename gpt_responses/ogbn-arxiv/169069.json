The use of quasiseparable matrices also has applications in computational geometry (cs.CG) and scientific computing (cs.SC), as mentioned in the abstract. The paper also introduces new structured representations, which could potentially fall under the subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of quasiseparable matrices in algebraic computing, which could fall under the subfield of control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
