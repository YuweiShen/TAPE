The use of configuration structures and their connection to propositional theories suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and formal language theory (cs.LT). Finally, the study of structural properties of Petri nets suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
