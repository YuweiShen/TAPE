The use of perceptual metrics in color space also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the application of the work to a distributed load-balancing visualization problem suggests a connection to scientific computing and simulation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
