The paper uses information-theoretic and combinatorial methods to derive lower bounds on the number of tests required for accurate reconstruction, and focuses on the linear sparsity regime. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in several areas of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
