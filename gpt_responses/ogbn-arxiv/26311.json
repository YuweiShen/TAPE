Additionally, the paper discusses the use of momentum in gradient descent, which is a common optimization technique used in deep learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with distributed systems and communication efficiency, which could place it in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The use of momentum in the local update step of the FL system could also suggest that it belongs to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
