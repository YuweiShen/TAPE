The focus on user interface and visualisation primitives suggests a potential fit for the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of the framework for physics experiments and detector design may also make it relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the integration with control panels and command line interfaces may suggest a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
