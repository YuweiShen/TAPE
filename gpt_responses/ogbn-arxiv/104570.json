The paper also discusses difference-of-convex functions (DC) programming problems, which is a topic in optimization and control theory (cs.SI). The use of semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation and generalized eigenvectors method suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on optimization and control theory may also make it relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
