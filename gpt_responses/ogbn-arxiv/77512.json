It also discusses the use of frames, which are widely used in signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions compressed sensing (cs.MM) and code-division multiple access (cs.SI) as applications of frame theory. Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely to be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
