The paper proposes a new framework for deep reinforcement learning that uses asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses visual input, which suggests it could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper involves neural networks, which could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
