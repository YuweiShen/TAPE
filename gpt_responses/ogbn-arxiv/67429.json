The paper also discusses the possible structures of these designs, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) or information theory and signal processing (cs.ITP). The construction of new codes with specific parameters could also be relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) or machine learning (cs.LG) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
