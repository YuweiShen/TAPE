This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) or Information Retrieval (cs.IR). \n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach using graph attention networks to extract structural information from long documents, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nFinally, the paper also discusses the limitations of existing deep models for short-long text matching, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) that deals with network analysis and modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
