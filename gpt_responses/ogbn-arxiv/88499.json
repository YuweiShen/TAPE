The paper uses deep reinforcement learning techniques to train a Seq2Seq model to generate well-formed questions from ill-formed ones. The paper also uses contextual word embeddings such as BERT to better encode the semantics of the questions. These techniques are commonly used in sub-categories such as computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
