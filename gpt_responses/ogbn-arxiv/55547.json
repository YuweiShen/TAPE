It also involves communication complexity, which is a subfield of computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The use of information spectrum methods is a technique commonly used in data science and machine learning (cs.DS). The paper also discusses tail bounds, which are a statistical concept often used in cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the implications for the function computation problem suggest a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
