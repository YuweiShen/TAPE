The paper focuses on the implementation of SPROBES, a primitive that enables introspection of operating system instructions. This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and software engineering (cs.SE), as it involves designing and implementing a security mechanism for software systems. The paper also discusses operating systems (cs.OS), computer architecture (cs.AR), and system-level issues (cs.SY) related to the implementation of SPROBES on ARM TrustZone hardware."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
