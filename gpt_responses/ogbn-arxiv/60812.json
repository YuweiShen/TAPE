The use of gaze behavior also suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper involves training networks to mimic human behavior, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of the networks to autonomous driving suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
