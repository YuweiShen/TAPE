The paper proposes a method for measuring the performance of TI systems, which involves capturing fine-grained performance in terms of delay and precision. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also discusses the need for a significant redesign of conventional networking techniques to realize TI applications, which could also place it in the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also mentions teleoperation, which involves the manipulation and control of remote environments, suggesting that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of evaluating TI advancements using meaningful performance metrics, which could place it in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper also mentions the potential of the proposed metrics to precisely characterize TI interactions, which could place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
