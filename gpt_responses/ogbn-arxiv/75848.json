The paper also evaluates the proposed method on public jigsaw datasets, which further supports its relevance to computer vision. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new formulation for solving jigsaw puzzles, which can be seen as a problem in artificial intelligence. The use of linear programming and the focus on global optimization also aligns with the AI sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a weighted L1 penalty, which is a common technique in machine learning, to increase the robustness of the proposed method. The use of LP assembly strategy can also be seen as a machine learning approach. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): Jigsaw puzzles are a common form of visual graphics, and the paper proposes a new method for solving them. The paper also includes visual results of the proposed method, which further supports its relevance to graphics. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new formulation for solving jigsaw puzzles, which can be seen as a problem in algorithms. The use of linear programming and the focus on global optimization also aligns with the DS sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
