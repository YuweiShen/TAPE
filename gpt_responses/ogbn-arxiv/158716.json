The paper presents fine-grained hardness results for CVP in various settings, including the approximate version and the version with preprocessing. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several subfields of computer science, such as data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), computational geometry (cs.CG), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
