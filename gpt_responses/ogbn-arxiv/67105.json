The paper also includes experiments on a robotic manipulator, indicating a focus on robotics (RO) and systems (SY). The use of curriculum learning suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and the paper proposes a new method for learning abstract skills, which could be relevant to programming languages (PL). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.PL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
