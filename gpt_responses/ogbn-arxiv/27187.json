This involves the use of polymer light-emitting diodes emitting at ~639 nm. The paper compares the new technique with conventional techniques like multi-CAP and OOK. The paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category as it deals with the transmission of information over a communication channel. It could also belong to the Network and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it deals with visible light communication systems. Other possible sub-categories include Operating Systems (cs.OH) as it involves the use of filters, Programming Languages (cs.PL) as it involves the use of modulation techniques, and Multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the use of light-emitting diodes for communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
