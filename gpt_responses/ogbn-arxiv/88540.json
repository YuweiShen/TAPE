This involves training an energy estimator using off-policy data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for regularizing model-based planning using an energy estimator, which involves training a neural network. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy of model-based planning, which is a key component of many AI systems. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in challenging continuous control tasks, which are often encountered in robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy of model-based planning, which is a key component of many control systems. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the proposed method involves learning a dynamics model from visual inputs, which is a common task in computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
