This falls under the scope of formal languages and automata theory.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the space complexity of machines and how even small amounts of space can be useful with the help of advice. This falls under the scope of computational complexity.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of inkdots as a form of advice to machines, which can be seen as a data structure. Additionally, the paper examines the effects of different forms of advice on the succinctness of the advised machines, which falls under the scope of algorithms.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of inkdots as advice to probabilistic finite automata and demonstrates the superiority of this model over its deterministic version. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) - The paper establishes the relations between the model of inkdots as advice and previously studied models of advised finite automata. This falls under the scope of logic in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
