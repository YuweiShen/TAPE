This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses convolutional encoder-decoder networks, which are a type of deep learning architecture, indicating a possible fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of a dataset gathered from the web suggests a possible fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
