The paper also discusses the challenges of learning from few samples and the need for generalisation, which are topics commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the importance of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) in facial expression recognition. Finally, the paper involves experiments and analysis of results, which could be considered as multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
