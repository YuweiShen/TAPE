It also involves network security and cryptography, which fall under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper specifically discusses covert communication in network links, which suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The techniques used in the paper involve probability mass functions and conditional probability, which are concepts in probability theory and statistics, and may suggest a focus on data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with covert communication techniques, which may fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
