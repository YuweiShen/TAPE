The paper also discusses reducing the decoding latency, which involves optimizing the algorithm's computational complexity and parallelism, making it relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and system and network optimization (cs.SI). The paper proposes a list decoding algorithm, which is a common technique in error-correcting codes (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is relevant to computer science theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
