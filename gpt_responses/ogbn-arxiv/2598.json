The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques for processing and analyzing the RF signals, which makes it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper addresses several challenges in passive RF sensing, which involves system design and control (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
