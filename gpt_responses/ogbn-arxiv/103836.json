The paper discusses the use of MIMO beamforming and full-duplex communication, which are common techniques in communication theory and networking. The problem of maximizing throughput rate under uncertainty constraints involves control theory. The use of multiple antennas at different stages of the system also involves multimedia and computer communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
