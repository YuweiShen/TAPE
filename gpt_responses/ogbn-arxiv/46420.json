The paper also discusses limitations of existing synthetic datasets for authorship attribution, which could fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of machine learning models for authorship attribution could also fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper specifically mentions code in C++, Python, and Java, which could suggest that it belongs to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a data collection approach that better reflects aspects important for potential practical use in software engineering, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
