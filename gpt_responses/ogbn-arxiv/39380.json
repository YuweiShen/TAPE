The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and pose estimation, which are commonly used in computer vision. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): Ego-motion estimation is an important task in robotics, as it enables robots to navigate and localize themselves in their environment. The paper proposes a method for visual ego-motion estimation, which is relevant to robotics. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method is based on an end-to-end learning approach using recurrent convolutional neural networks. The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation to improve the performance of the model. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method uses deep learning techniques for visual ego-motion estimation, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a method based on recurrent convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
