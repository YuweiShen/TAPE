Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a graph matching scheme and a dynamic graph matching method, which involves learning a better feature space, indicating that machine learning (cs.LG) is also a likely sub-category. Moreover, the paper deals with video data, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the robustness of the proposed method to noisy initial training data, which is related to cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
