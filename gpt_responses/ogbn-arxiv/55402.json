Given that the paper focuses on DNN training, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LG and cs.CV, which are the two most relevant sub-categories. However, since the paper also discusses optimization and energy estimation, it could also be classified under cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
