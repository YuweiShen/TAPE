Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their performance, making cs.IT a likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a transmission scheme for mmWave-NOMA networks, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. Additionally, the use of stochastic geometry to characterize the performance of the proposed scheme is also relevant to this category.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper investigates the coexistence of two key enabling technologies for 5G mobile networks, which are both related to communication and networking. The proposed transmission scheme and the use of random beamforming are also relevant to this category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes two random beamforming approaches to reduce system overhead in the addressed mmWave-NOMA communication scenario. This topic is related to systems and control, making cs.SY a possible category for this paper.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper investigates the performance of a transmission scheme that uses mmWave communications, which are often used for high-bandwidth multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
