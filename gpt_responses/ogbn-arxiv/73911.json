The use of entrenchment relations for the study of belief revision and expectation inference suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the mention of expectation ordering suggests a possible connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
