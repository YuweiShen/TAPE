The problem of discovering polarized communities in signed networks involves graph partitioning and spectral clustering, which are common techniques in data mining and graph theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
