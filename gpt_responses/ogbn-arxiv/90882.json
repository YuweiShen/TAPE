The algorithm is based on nearest marked ancestor queries on the suffix tree, which is a common technique in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses constructing position heaps, which is a problem in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents a worst-case linear-time algorithm, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
