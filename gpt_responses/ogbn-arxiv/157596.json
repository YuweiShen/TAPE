This involves computer vision techniques for analyzing body movements (cs.CV), as well as human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and robotics (cs.RO) for developing games to test the system. The use of machine learning (cs.LG) for classification is also mentioned. Finally, the paper involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the recognition of emotions conveyed through body gestures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
