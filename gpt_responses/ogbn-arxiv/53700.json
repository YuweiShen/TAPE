The proposed method also involves the use of dynamic loss weights and residual fusion block, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the evaluation of the method is based on the PSV dataset, which is a type of panoramic surround view (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
