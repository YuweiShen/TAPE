This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a new networking policy, which involves restructuring the way content is forwarded in the P2P network, which could fall under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides a practical implementation of the proposed policy, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
