The use of error-correcting codes and network coding also suggests categories such as distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new coding scheme based on Staircase codes, which is a type of erasure code used in network coding (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
