The use of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.DS), while the focus on minimum message size and sub-packetization factor suggests a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the use of novel code constructions and a matching converse suggests a connection to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
