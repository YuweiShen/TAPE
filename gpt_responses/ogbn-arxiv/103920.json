The paper also mentions the use of sound recognition algorithms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.AI) and potentially cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for future improvements to the system, which could involve information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
