This approach is applied to pedestrian and face detection, which are both subfields of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of modern deep models, which suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of convolution, which is a common technique in neural networks and signal processing, indicating a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
