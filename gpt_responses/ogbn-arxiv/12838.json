Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also introduces a new family of building blocks for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, which involves learning parameters from the data. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several video recognition datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
