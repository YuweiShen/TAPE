The focus is on safety and security, which are both subfields of computer security (cs.CR). The proposed approach involves simulation of system dynamics, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses an application example in power grids, which is related to cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
