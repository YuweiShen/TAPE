The paper also discusses lower bounds on the public discussion rate required to achieve a given secret key rate, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR). The paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) as it deals with the transmission of information over a noisy channel. The use of hypergraphical sources suggests that the paper may also be relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) as it deals with the processing of information transmitted over a noisy channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
