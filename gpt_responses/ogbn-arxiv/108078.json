This falls under the scope of computational complexity theory, making cs.CC the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may involve the use of data structures and algorithms to analyze the communication complexity of the two classes. This makes cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve the use of information theory to analyze the communication complexity of the two classes. This makes cs.IT a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may involve the use of machine learning techniques to analyze the communication complexity of the two classes. This makes cs.LG a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper may involve the use of discrete mathematics to analyze the communication complexity of the two classes.
