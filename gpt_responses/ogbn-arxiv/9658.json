The use of automated vehicles also suggests a potential application in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The methodology proposed in the paper involves the use of sensors and data analysis, which could fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the precision metrics and error analysis presented in the paper suggest a potential application in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
