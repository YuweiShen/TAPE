The paper also introduces a new control chart, which is a statistical tool used for monitoring and detecting changes in a process (cs.ST). The proposed chart is designed to handle high frequency data, which is often encountered in control systems and process monitoring applications (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of using the traditional control charts and proposes a new approach that can be used to track both process variation and central tendency, which is relevant to the field of neural networks and control systems (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
