It could also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it involves monitoring resource allocations and throughput of active subscribers in a public mobile radio cell. Information Theory (cs.IT) is another possible sub-category as the paper discusses the accuracy of data obtained from monitoring control channels. Systems and Control (cs.SY) is also a possible sub-category as the paper presents a new open-source instrument for monitoring mobile networks. Finally, Multimedia (cs.MM) is a possible sub-category as the paper discusses the development of methods to increase service quality in mobile networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
