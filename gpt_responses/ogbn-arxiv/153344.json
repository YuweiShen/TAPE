The paper also mentions the need for new approaches to meet the demands of beyond 5G networks, which could involve system-level design and control (cs.SY). The three new multiple antenna related research directions presented in the paper, namely cell-free massive MIMO, beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces, are all related to signal processing and communication systems, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
