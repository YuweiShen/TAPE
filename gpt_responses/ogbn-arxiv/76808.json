This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also focuses on continuous control tasks, which suggests that it may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions ablations that provide insights into design choices, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
