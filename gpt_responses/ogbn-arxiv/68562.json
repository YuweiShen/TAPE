The paper also discusses the use of Slepian functions, which are commonly used in signal processing (cs.SP) and the paper provides estimates for the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is a common metric in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of compressive acquisition methods for multi-band signals, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper provides analytic proofs and convergence rates, which are topics in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
