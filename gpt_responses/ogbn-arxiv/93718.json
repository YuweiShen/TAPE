The proposed pipeline involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks, which are also commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper introduces a new technique for training the network, which involves a reflective loss, which could potentially fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
