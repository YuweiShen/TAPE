The paper proposes a new approach called Meta Reward Learning (MeRL) to construct an auxiliary reward function that provides more refined feedback for learning. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
