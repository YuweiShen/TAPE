Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The problem is also related to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) since it involves manipulating and optimizing graphs. The paper mentions applications in phylogenetics and software engineering, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
