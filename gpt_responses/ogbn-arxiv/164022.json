The paper also mentions a subroutine for a problem called the Rubik table problem, which is related to multi-robot motion planning, indicating a connection to robotics (cs.RO). The use of algorithms to solve the rearrangement problem suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of geometric techniques, which suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a subroutine for a problem that is of independent interest, which suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
