The approach uses meta-learning to train a dynamics model prior that can be rapidly adapted to the local context. The experiments involve continuous control tasks on both simulated and real-world agents, including a legged millirobot. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the experiments involve visual perception and image processing, which suggest the possibility of cs.CV (Computer Vision) being a relevant sub-category. Finally, the experiments also involve control systems and feedback loops, which suggest the possibility of cs.SY (Systems and Control) being a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
