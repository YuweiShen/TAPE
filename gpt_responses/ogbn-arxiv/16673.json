The paper also mentions hypergraphs, which are a common topic in discrete mathematics and combinatorics, hence cs.DM is a likely sub-category. The use of a parameterized relaxation of the problem and the limitation on space suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper establishes lower bounds, which is a common theme in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT), making these sub-categories likely as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
