The use of stochastic geometry and analytical tools also suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). The application of transmission capacity to scheduling, power control, and multiple antennas also involves signal processing and multimedia (cs.MM) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
