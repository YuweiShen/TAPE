The use of dilated convolutions is a technique that has been gaining popularity in recent years for improving the spatial resolution of feature maps, which is relevant to both computer vision and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the impact of dilated convolutions on downstream applications such as object localization and semantic segmentation, which are subfields of computer vision and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of residual networks is a specific architecture choice that is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE), and the paper also discusses the issue of gridding artifacts, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
