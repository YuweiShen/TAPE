This falls under the sub-category of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL. Additionally, the paper uses probing tasks to reveal the information stored in each representation layer, which is a common technique in machine learning research and falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also includes visualizations of hidden states, which could potentially fall under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
