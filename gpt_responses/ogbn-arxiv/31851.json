The paper also mentions that the models have practical and technological applications, which suggests that it may also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The models are designed to process visual stimuli and make predictions that can be compared to human or animal responses, which involves neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE and cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the models, which may involve human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
