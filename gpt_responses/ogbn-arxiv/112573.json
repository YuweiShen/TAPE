Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the practical application of the beamforming vectors in MIMO radar systems, which could fall under cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper presents a method for selecting the best beamforming vectors, which could be related to machine learning and optimization, and thus could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
