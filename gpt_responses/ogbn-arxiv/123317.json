The method involves leveraging a large number of training examples generated using a physical simulator, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The system also involves predicting the dynamics model parameters online, which is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the system on a variety of tasks, including block-throwing of a manipulator, which suggests the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
