The proposed framework involves the use of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications. Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on three benchmark datasets, which suggests a potential focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and evaluation methodologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
