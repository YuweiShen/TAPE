The paper proposes a dictionary-based approach for solving this problem, which involves modeling the hyperspectral image as a superposition of a low-rank component and a dictionary sparse component. This approach involves techniques from computer vision (e.g., image processing, target detection) and machine learning (e.g., dictionary learning, sparse coding), which are typically covered in the cs.CV and cs.LG sub-categories. The paper also presents recovery guarantees based on recent theoretical results, which involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents experimental evaluations on real hyperspectral datasets, which involves techniques from data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
