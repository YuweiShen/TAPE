The use of divide-and-conquer and SDP formulations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and game theory and economics (cs.GT). Finally, the applications of the algorithms to computing homology groups and persistent homology suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
