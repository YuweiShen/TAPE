This involves developing a fully autonomous system for monitoring wildfires in remote areas using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed system utilizes drones with different sensing and imaging capabilities to collect imagery information from the impacted areas. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a distributed leader-follower coalition formation model to cluster a set of drones into multiple coalitions that collectively cover the designated monitoring field. This involves developing a fully autonomous system for monitoring wildfires in remote areas using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed system utilizes autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide on-demand monitoring service faster than the current approaches of using satellite images, manned aircraft and remotely controlled drones. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly mention any cryptography or security-related aspects, but it is possible that such aspects may be relevant in the context of developing a secure and reliable system for monitoring wildfires in remote areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
