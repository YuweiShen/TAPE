This falls under the scope of information theory, which deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies a wireless network scenario where users communicate with a base station using NOMA. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture, which deals with the design, implementation, and management of computer networks. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper considers a secure NOMA system where the legitimate users' messages are protected from eavesdroppers. This falls under the scope of cryptography and security, which deals with the protection of information from unauthorized access. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a cooperative NOMA scheme where the strong user acts as a relay to forward the messages of the weak user. This falls under the scope of systems and control, which deals with the analysis and design of complex systems. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but it considers the joint distribution of the distance between two random users, which can be used to model the spatial distribution of multimedia content in a wireless network. Therefore, it can be loosely associated with the multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
