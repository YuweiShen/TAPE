The focus is on classifying images of faces, which falls under the subfield of facial recognition (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of low-level features such as color and texture, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
