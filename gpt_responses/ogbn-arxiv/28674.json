The paper proposes a new method for negative sampling in KG embedding, which is a common problem in this field. The paper uses a cache to keep track of important negative triplets, which is a novel approach. This paper involves machine learning, natural language processing, and database systems, which are all covered by the above-mentioned sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.DB, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
