The paper also discusses ways to leverage weakly labeled data for training, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper's focus on video segmentation suggests it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
