The use of multi-layer messages is a key aspect of the proposed scheme, which suggests that the paper could also be classified under multimedia (cs.MM). The fact that the users are ordered in increasing channel quality and that different quality representations of the underlying content are considered suggests that the paper could also be classified under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of scalable coded video segments suggests that the paper could also be classified under computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
