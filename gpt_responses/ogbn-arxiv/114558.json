The paper also discusses the use of multi-task learning and self-supervised learning, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a lightweight backbone network for real-time processing, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on the WIDER FACE dataset, which is a common benchmark for object detection (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
