The use of coresets is a common technique in computational geometry (cs.CG) and the paper specifically mentions the use of geometric properties of the point set. The problem of maintaining a clustering of a stream of points is also a topic in data mining (cs.DM) and streaming algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
