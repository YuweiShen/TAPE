The approach presented in the paper involves pre-computing bridges in narrow or tight regions of the workspace, which requires the use of kinodynamic RRT algorithms, a common technique in robotics motion planning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of local multi-agent navigation algorithms, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of 2D and 3D workspaces, which could involve computer vision techniques for perception and mapping (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
