The scheme also involves the use of chaotic sequences, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper specifically deals with image encryption, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
