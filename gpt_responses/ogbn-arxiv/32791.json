This problem is closely related to coding theory and information theory, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with distributed computing systems, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance limits of coded distributed computing systems, which could place it in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The use of codes over erasure channels suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes code designs using polar and Reed-Muller codes, which could place it in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
