The use of planning graphs and heuristics suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The scalability of the approach suggests that it may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the optimization of plan quality metrics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
