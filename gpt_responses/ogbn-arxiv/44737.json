It focuses on reasoning about aspects of object languages that have been formally presented through recursive rules based on syntactic structure. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses lambda tree syntax approach to treating binding in object languages, which is a topic that falls under Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the development of proofs of properties about specifications, which is a topic that falls under Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of Abella to prove normalizability properties of the lambda calculus, which is a topic that falls under Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the style of theorem proving that Abella supports, which is a topic that falls under Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
