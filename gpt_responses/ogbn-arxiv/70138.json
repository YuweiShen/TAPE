The paper also proposes a novel mechanism for addressing the imbalance between foregrounds and backgrounds in object detection, which involves end-to-end optimization and multiple cascaded objectness-related modules with residual connections. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper involves optimization and refinement procedures, which are common in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the COCO dataset, which is commonly used in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
