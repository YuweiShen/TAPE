The proposed method also seems to have implications for natural language processing and knowledge representation, which are important subfields of AI.\n\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper argues that natural language can be used as a guide to discovering the structure of commonsense knowledge. This suggests a strong connection between the two fields, and the paper may be of interest to researchers working on natural language processing and computational linguistics.\n\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a systematic method to the discovery of the structure of commonsense knowledge, which may involve machine learning techniques. The paper may be of interest to researchers working on knowledge representation and reasoning, which are important topics in machine learning.\n\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) - The paper discusses the formulation of a meaning algebra, which is a topic that falls under the scope of logic in computer science. The paper may be of interest to researchers working on formal methods and logic-based approaches to knowledge representation and reasoning.\n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - This sub-category is less likely, but the paper may be of interest to researchers working on secure knowledge representation and reasoning, which is an important topic in cryptography and security.
