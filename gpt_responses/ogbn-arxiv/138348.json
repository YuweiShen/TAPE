The use of bots also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. The study conducted to validate the effectiveness of the bot involves analyzing data, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category. Finally, the paper aims to make the extraction of useful information easier for developers, which could fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
