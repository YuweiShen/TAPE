This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). However, given the focus on wireless communication and network slicing, cs.NI is the most likely category. The paper also discusses waveform-level scheduling and coordination, which could be relevant to cs.IT and cs.AR. The discussion of inter-level operations and the proposed framework for holistic slicing could be relevant to cs.SY. Finally, the mention of experimental results suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
