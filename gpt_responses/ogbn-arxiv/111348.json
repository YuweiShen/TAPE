The paper also mentions Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities and pooling operators, which are related to optimization and neural network theory (cs.NE). The use of different types of transforms, such as wavelets and curvelets, suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the theory to image captioning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
