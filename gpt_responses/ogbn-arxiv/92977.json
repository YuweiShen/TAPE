The use of images and key press data suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The ultimate goal of replicating human driving behavior for safety purposes suggests the involvement of robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
