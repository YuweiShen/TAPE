The authors propose a new dataset and benchmark for salient object detection, which involves machine learning and data analysis (cs.AI, cs.LG). The dataset also includes attributes that reflect common challenges in real-world scenes, which could be relevant to multimedia analysis (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
