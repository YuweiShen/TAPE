The specific motivation for the technique is value-based reinforcement learning, which suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are likely categories. The paper also mentions prior work on learning to play Atari games, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) may be relevant. Additionally, the technique could be applied to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
