It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it specifically focuses on the training of neural networks. Additionally, since the paper mentions the use of neural network architectures, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the paper discusses the distribution of stochastic gradient noise, it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
