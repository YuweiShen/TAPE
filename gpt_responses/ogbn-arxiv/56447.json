The paper may discuss security issues related to the proposed strategy.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) is a less likely category, but still possible as the paper may involve computational methods to analyze the performance of LPWANs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
