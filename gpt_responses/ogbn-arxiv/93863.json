The use of random walks over dynamic graphs also suggests a focus on graph-based machine learning, which is often studied in the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also deals with recommender systems, which are commonly studied in the cs.IR sub-category. The focus on user trust and privacy suggests a potential overlap with the cs.SI sub-category, which deals with social and information networks. Finally, the use of a crowdsourced user-study suggests a potential overlap with the cs.HC sub-category, which deals with human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
