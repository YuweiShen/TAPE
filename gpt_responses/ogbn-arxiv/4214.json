The paper also involves mathematical modeling and probability theory to analyze the performance of Wi-Fi in the presence of LTE-U, which suggests the involvement of information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM) subcategories. The paper also deals with fairness and air time sharing, which can be related to system and control (cs.SY) subcategory.
