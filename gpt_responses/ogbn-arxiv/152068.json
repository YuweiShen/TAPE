This topic falls under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also discusses parallel SMR, which involves executing independent transactions in parallel while ensuring consistency among replicas. This topic falls under the Operating Systems (cs.OS) and Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The paper proposes an index-based scheduler for efficient dependency detection and concurrent execution of transactions, which falls under the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability and robustness of the proposed scheduler, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
