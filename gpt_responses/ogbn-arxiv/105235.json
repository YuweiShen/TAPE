This involves addressing data variability and improving accuracy of image retrieval. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also deals with multi-modality and view-point changes, which suggests it could also belong to multimedia (cs.MM). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category, as the paper discusses the need for tools to capture information from endoscopy videos for clinical reporting. Machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper proposes the use of autoencoders and Siamese networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
