The approach is based on control flow graphs, which are a common tool in programming language theory (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the issue of copyright violations, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The use of fingerprints to efficiently store and retrieve code fragments suggests a machine learning or data mining approach (cs.LG), and the similarity search aspect of the technique suggests information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
