The paper also mentions higher-order extensions of model checking, which could indicate that it belongs to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The use of type-based characterization suggests that it could also belong to the Language Theory (cs.LT) sub-category. The paper proposes a practical algorithm for HFL model checking, which could indicate that it belongs to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category.
