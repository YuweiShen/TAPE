Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also focuses on IoT and its sensing capabilities, which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as another likely category. The proposed scheme involves computation and communication overheads, indicating cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible category. The paper also mentions the resource-constrained IoT terminals, which suggests cs.SE (Software Engineering) as another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the authentication of big data, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
