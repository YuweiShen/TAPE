The approach proposed in the paper involves examining code comments, which could also fall under programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of technical debt on software maintenance, which could be relevant to software development (cs.SD) sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed approach involves using open-source projects, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
