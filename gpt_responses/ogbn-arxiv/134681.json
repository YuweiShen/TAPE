It also involves the transmission of a source over a channel, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). The use of side information at the decoders suggests a connection to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). The derivation of bounds on achievable distortion regions involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could fall under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the use of Gaussian and binary sources suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
