The use of regularization techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) or information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The numerical scheme used for computation could also place it in the optimization and control (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of state-of-the-art methods and experimental results suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
