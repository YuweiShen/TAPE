It also involves complexity theory, specifically the complexity class $\\Pi_2^p$, which falls under computational complexity (cs.CC). The study of tournaments and reachability problems also falls under graph theory (cs.DS). The paper may also be relevant to the study of game theory (cs.GT) as kings in tournaments are related to the concept of dominance in games. Finally, the construction and analysis of succinctly specified families of tournaments may involve computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
