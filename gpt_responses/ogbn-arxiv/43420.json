This involves the use of preference annotations and alternative stable-models, which are techniques commonly used in the areas of database systems (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which is a topic of interest in the areas of logic and optimization (cs.LO), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
