The algorithm also relies on successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI) and system theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for generalization to multiple transmitting antennas and multidimensional constellation sets, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
