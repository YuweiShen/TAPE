The paper also mentions the use of SDN hardware, which is a topic in the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper proposes a new approach to traffic engineering, which involves dynamically adapting sending rates as conditions change, which falls under the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the built-in protection against unexpected bursts of traffic and failures, which is a topic in the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of simulations to evaluate the proposed approach, which is a topic in the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
