The method involves coordination between multiple agents, which suggests the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also mentions the use of a network to estimate joint action-values, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the evaluation of the method is done on a set of micromanagement tasks, which could suggest the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
