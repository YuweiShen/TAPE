The use of optimisation techniques and integer programming is also a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning and optimisation (cs.LG). The paper also deals with discrete data, which is a common topic in data mining (cs.DM). The use of cutting planes to enforce acyclicity constraints is a technique commonly used in combinatorial optimisation (cs.SI), and the paper also mentions the use of information theory (cs.IT) in the context of Bayesian networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
