Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the time complexity of encoding and decoding, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of pruned variants and generalization to prime $q$-ary-input channels could also place it in cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
