The focus on structured data and query languages suggests a strong connection to database systems (cs.DB). Additionally, the use of Open, Big, and Linked Data and the mention of AI and DL in the abstract suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.DL). The mention of specific data management solutions and the need for efficient consumption and management of data suggest a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the mention of cyber data management solutions and the need for benchmarking suggests a connection to cybersecurity (cs.CYBER)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
