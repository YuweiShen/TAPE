The paper also proposes a new metric for evaluating generative models of video, which involves measuring the distance between the feature representations of real and generated videos, which could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper introduces a new benchmark dataset for generative models of video based on StarCraft 2 game play, which could be categorized under graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
