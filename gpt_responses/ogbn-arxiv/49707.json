This involves using retrospective imitation learning to improve the policy by learning from its own retrospective solutions. The paper also highlights the ability of the approach to iteratively scale up or transfer to larger problem sizes than the initial expert demonstrations. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.RO (Robotics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
