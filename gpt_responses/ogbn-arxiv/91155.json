It also involves clustering-based algorithms and deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Additionally, Multimedia (cs.MM) is another likely category as the paper deals with generating videos for promotional purposes. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possible category as the paper proposes an algorithmic approach to generate persuasive sequences of visual materials. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) are also possible categories as the paper involves learning from data and clustering-based algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
