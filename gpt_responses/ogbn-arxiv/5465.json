It proposes a novel approach for estimating Truck Factors and executes it against a corpus of popular projects in GitHub. The paper also surveys developers to assess the reliability of the results. This work is primarily focused on software engineering (cs.SE) and cybersecurity (cs.CY) as it deals with identifying concentration of knowledge and turnover of developers. It also involves programming languages (cs.PL) and software systems (cs.SI) as it analyzes popular projects in GitHub and proposes a novel approach for estimating Truck Factors. There is also a possibility of it being categorized under cryptography (cs.CR) as it deals with identifying vulnerabilities in software development environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
