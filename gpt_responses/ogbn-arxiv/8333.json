This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a soft activation mapping (SAM) method, which involves the use of neural networks to extract radiomics features, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with medical imaging and diagnosis, which falls under the medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a high-level feature enhancement scheme, which involves the use of neural networks, and hence falls under the neural networks (cs.NEURON) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
