The paper also discusses the use of regularization techniques, which is a common topic in both machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve real-world datasets, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of sparse regularization, which is a common topic in natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
