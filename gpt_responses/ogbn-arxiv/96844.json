The algorithms presented involve numerical computations, which suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of encryption schemes and mathematical properties also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the algorithms suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
