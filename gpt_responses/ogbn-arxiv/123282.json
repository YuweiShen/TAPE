This topic falls under the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) which is the most likely category. The paper also presents results from different stochastic and deterministic reduced precision training methods applied to RNNs, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper tests the RNNs on several datasets, which falls under the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for specialized hardware for deep networks, which falls under the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
