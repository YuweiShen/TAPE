Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also proposes a new method for feature aggregation, which involves learning to select the appropriate mode locally, indicating a focus on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. Additionally, the paper involves spatio-temporal aggregation, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses constraints on the feature interaction, which could be considered a form of regularization, indicating a focus on cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
