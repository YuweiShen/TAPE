It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as steganography is a technique used in multimedia to hide information. Additionally, it may belong to Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as steganography is a security technique. The paper also proposes a novel normalization technique, which may make it relevant to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
