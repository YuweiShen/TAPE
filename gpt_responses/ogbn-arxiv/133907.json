The problem involves multiple terminals, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category of multiterminal information theory (cs.MM). The encoding scheme used in the paper is called mismatched multiterminal encoding (MME), which could be of interest to researchers working on information theory for systems with imperfect channel state information (cs.SI). The paper also involves optimization and evaluation of performance metrics, which could place it in the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
