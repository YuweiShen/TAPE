This approach is inspired by decision trees and is used to predict outcomes and analyze behavior. This is a typical machine learning problem, and the paper uses several machine learning techniques and algorithms. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the importance of creating interpretable models that not only accurately predict outcomes but also identify important factors associated with a given behavior. This is important for informing strategies aimed at changing behavior, designing social systems, and minimizing algorithmic bias. The paper also applies the proposed approach to large-scale data collected from diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and Digg, which are all related to social systems and human behavior. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper applies the proposed approach to large-scale data collected from diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and Digg, which are all related to social systems and human behavior.
