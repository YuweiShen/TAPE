The approach involves using asynchronous actor-critic agents, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO). The navigation is based on visual input, which is processed using computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The approach involves training a neural network, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the approach in creating intelligent agents that can adapt to a wide range of environments, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
