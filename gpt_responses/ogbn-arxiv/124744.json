Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The proposed method involves decomposition of regions in the maps, which suggests that it may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The method does not rely on assumptions such as same scale or initial guess, indicating that it may be applicable to a wide range of scenarios, which could fall under the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
