Computer vision techniques may be used to overcome this challenge. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a binary medium classifier trained using joint torque measurements and a closed-loop control law that relies on an error signal compactly encoded in the decision boundary of the classifier. This involves the use of machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel control strategy that involves the use of a binary medium classifier and closed-loop control law, which can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a closed-loop control law to address the precision cutting of soft tissue problem, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
