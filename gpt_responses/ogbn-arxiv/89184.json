The potential applications mentioned in the abstract, such as measuring a concept's complexity degree and importance degree, suggest a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The use of semantic networks and concept maps also suggests a connection to natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and cybersecurity (cs.CY) due to the emphasis on understanding and organizing complex information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
