The focus is on spatial redundancy of input samples, which suggests a computer vision (cs.CV) application. The proposed network architecture involves adaptive inference, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of lightweight sub-networks, which suggests a potential application in neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the proposed network architecture is evaluated on image classification tasks, which suggests a potential application in natural language processing (cs.CL) for tasks such as image captioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
