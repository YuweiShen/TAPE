The paper proposes a new algorithm for data valuation based on the Shapley value, which is a well-known concept in cooperative game theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary area of research for this paper. Additionally, the paper also discusses various applications of data valuation, such as label noise correction, watermark detection, data summarization, active data acquisition, and domain adaption, which are relevant to other sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
