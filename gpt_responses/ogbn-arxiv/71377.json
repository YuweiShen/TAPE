This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach involves hierarchical task optimization, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The safety aspect is also related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the validation of the approach involves simulations and real-world experiments with grasping, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
