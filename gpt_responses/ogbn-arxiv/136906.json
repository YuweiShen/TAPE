The use of graph genus and the NP-hardness result suggest that the paper may also belong to the graph theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The investigation of storyline visualizations and the FPT algorithm for circular layouts suggest that the paper may also belong to the information visualization (cs.SI) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Finally, the use of algorithmic techniques and analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
