The paper also involves analyzing the weight distribution of Reed-Muller codes, which is related to coding theory (cs.DS). The use of Reed-Muller codes in error correction and interpolation also relates to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves analyzing the capacity of channels, which is a topic in communication complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper involves analyzing the performance of codes in handling noisy evaluations, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
