This involves using latent representations extracted from longitudinal data across multiple modalities, including volumetric information extracted from medical scans and demographic info. The model incorporates the time horizon by generating a sequence of latent representations of the patient status across the time horizon, providing more informative modeling of the temporal relationships between the patient's history and future visits. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
