The use of deep learning, in particular convolution neural networks, is a recent development in computer vision and has enabled researchers to address several problems of vision such as recognition, tracking, localization etc. The paper uses AlexNet, a deep CNN, for feature extraction in the first stage of image registration. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with evaluating distance measures for feature-based image registration, which involves matching features extracted from images. This makes it likely to belong to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
