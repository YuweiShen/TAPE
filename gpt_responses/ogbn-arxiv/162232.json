The use of spectral complexity to measure network capacity is also a popular research area in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses theoretical and empirical limitations of spectral complexity, which could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
