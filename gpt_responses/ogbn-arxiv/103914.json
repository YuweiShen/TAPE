The paper specifically focuses on the use of BiLSTM-based models for dependency parsing and their ability to capture structural context implicitly. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is the primary category for NLP research. \n\nThe paper also discusses the information flow in neural architectures, which suggests that it could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses ablation studies to demonstrate the significance of structural context, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which also use ablation studies to analyze the significance of features in neural models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
