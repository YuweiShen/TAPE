Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as time-delay neural networks, which fall under the categories of cs.SD (Sound) and cs.LG (Learning). Additionally, the use of semi-supervised training is a common technique in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the paper discusses the use of decoder confidence as a threshold, which falls under the category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
