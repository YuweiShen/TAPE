This falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.CG). The paper also mentions semidefinite programming relaxations, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the Max Cut problem, which is a well-studied problem in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
