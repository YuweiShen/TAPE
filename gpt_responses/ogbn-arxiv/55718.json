The paper focuses on machine learning tasks and proposes a new algorithm that achieves a linear iteration speedup with lower communication complexity. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
