This involves using Bayesian optimization to select the distribution of environment variables that maximizes the improvement generated by each iteration of the policy gradient method. The paper also introduces two easy-to-compute low-dimensional fingerprints of the current policy. Given these characteristics, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and multiagent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
