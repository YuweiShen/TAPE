It proposes a novel technique called Metatrace that uses meta-gradient descent to tune step-size parameters for RL algorithms. The paper also evaluates the technique in various settings, including linear and nonlinear function approximation, and in both stationary and non-stationary environments. Given the focus on RL and the use of meta-learning, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Other relevant sub-categories include cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) for the use of eligibility traces, cs.RO (Robotics) for the potential application of RL in robotics, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) for the focus on control in RL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
