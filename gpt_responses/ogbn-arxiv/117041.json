This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as detecting 2D human joint positions and scene layout analysis (GR). The paper also proposes a global optimization approach, which falls under robotics (RO) and machine learning (MM) categories. Finally, the approach is data-driven, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.GR, followed by cs.RO, cs.MM, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
