Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and transmission of information over noisy channels, which is relevant to this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers multiple and independent unicast transmissions between network nodes while a number of them serve as relays of the interfered/superimposed signals. This is a networking problem and falls under the scope of cs.NI.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a system for wireless video transmission and formulates a utility optimization framework for the video transmission problem. This is related to multimedia systems and applications.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new PHY and formulates an optimization framework for the video transmission problem. This involves designing and analyzing a system, which falls under the scope of cs.SY.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not explicitly mention security or cryptography, wireless communication systems are vulnerable to various attacks and security is an important aspect to consider. Therefore, cs.CR is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
