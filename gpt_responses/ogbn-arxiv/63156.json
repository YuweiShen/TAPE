The paper presents an automatic camera calibration process that uses a CNN-based camera pose estimator and pedestrian observations to establish the 4-D scene geometry. This involves reasoning about the spatial proximity between objects at different times, which is a key problem in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of a CNN-based camera pose estimator suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on designing robust activity detectors suggests that it may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
