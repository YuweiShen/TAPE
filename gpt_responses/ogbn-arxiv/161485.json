It discusses the problems that arise in metadata-driven Digital Libraries and how these services compensate for those problems. The paper also evaluates the services with relevance assessments conducted by information science students. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
