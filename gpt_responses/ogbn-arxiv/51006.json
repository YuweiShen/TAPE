The proposed framework involves deep learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) and cybernetics (cs.CY) as it aims to enable direct control of IoT objects via brain signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
