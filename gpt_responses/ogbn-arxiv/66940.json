The problem is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem, which involves system dynamics and uncertainty, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed method involves statistical inference and sampling, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions examples of quadrotor control in a complex obstacle field, which suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV) for obstacle detection and avoidance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
