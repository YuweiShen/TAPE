The paper also discusses incremental learning, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system proposed in the paper is designed for edge devices, which suggests that it may be relevant to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper mentions real-time dataset construction, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
