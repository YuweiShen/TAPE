This involves designing and implementing a tool to detect behavior deviation of a DL model when processing an input case and considering it the symptom of invalid input cases. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of deep learning-based systems, which falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves using a DL model, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of a tool to detect behavior deviation of a DL model, which involves software engineering principles. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the vulnerability of DL models to invalid inputs, which is a security concern. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed method aims to enhance the reliability of DL-based systems, which falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
