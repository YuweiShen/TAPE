Specifically, it proposes a novel framework for end-to-end learning of anomaly scores using neural deviation learning. This work involves the use of neural networks and optimization techniques, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of prior knowledge and labeled anomalies, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper proposes a data-efficient approach to anomaly detection, which is related to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
