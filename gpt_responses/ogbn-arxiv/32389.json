The main focus is on developing a cycle-consistency loss that can be used to train ASR models without the need for paired data. This work involves techniques from several subfields of computer science, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP and ML. Other likely sub-categories include cs.SD (Sound), cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SD (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
