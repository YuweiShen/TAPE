The use of sparse error recovery algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of signal processing (cs.SI). The focus on large-scale systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The empirical simulations mentioned in the abstract suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of symbol slicing suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
