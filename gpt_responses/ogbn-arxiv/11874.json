The regularizer is applied in supervised learning and encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in the network by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of Computer Science such as Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
