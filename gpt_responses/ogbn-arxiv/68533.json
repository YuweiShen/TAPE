The use of algebraic-geometry codes and bilinear algebra suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the construction of asymptotically good families of codes may also be of interest to researchers in the area of distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
