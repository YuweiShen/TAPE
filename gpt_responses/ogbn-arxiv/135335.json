Therefore, the most likely category is cs.GR (Graphics), which covers topics related to computer graphics, visualization, and image processing. The paper also focuses on preserving important image contents and reducing image distortion, which are core topics in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the proposed framework can be applied to videos, which involves temporal consistency and human-computer interaction, making it relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and information retrieval (cs.IR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
