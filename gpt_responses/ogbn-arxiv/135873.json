The approach uses attentive gating networks trained with a Granger-causal objective, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks for time-series analysis (cs.NE). The experiments involve image classification tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing tasks (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE, followed by cs.CV and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
