The paper also focuses on uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout, which is a common technique used in machine learning and falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the integration of physical constraints in the neural network architecture, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper focuses on deep learning models, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Deep Learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
