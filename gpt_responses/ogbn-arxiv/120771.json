The use of algorithms to solve the problem of determining mate-in-1 and mate-in-2 in Netrunner suggests that it could also fall under cs.AI. Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the structure of the game, which could be considered computational geometry and thus fall under cs.CG. Finally, the use of decks with an arbitrary number of copies of a card suggests that the paper could also be relevant to cs.DS, as it involves analyzing the complexity of a problem involving a large number of possible configurations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
