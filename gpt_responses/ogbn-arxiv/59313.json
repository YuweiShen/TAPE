The code construction is deterministic and involves the use of graphs, which are also common in computer science (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the design of irregular codes, which is a topic in coding theory and optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses a convergence result for sparse graphs, which is related to network analysis and graph algorithms (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
