The decision procedure for WordEquations mentioned in the abstract also suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of geometry in the abstract could indicate a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
