The paper focuses on the development of intelligent agents that can achieve high-level coordination by dynamically choosing complementary skills and executing primitive actions to perform these skills. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper also discusses the scalability and interpretability of the proposed method, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
