The use of statistical-mechanical methods suggests a possible connection to computational physics (cs.CP) or statistical physics (cond-mat.stat-mech), but since the focus is on information theory, we prioritize cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability) over those categories. The paper also involves enumeration of type classes, which is a combinatorial problem, suggesting a possible connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of input constraints and power limitation suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
