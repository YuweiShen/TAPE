The primary focus is on improving the detection performance under challenging illumination conditions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses different network architectures and their adaptations, which suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also relevant sub-categories. The proposed method is designed for robotics applications, which makes robotics (cs.RO) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper uses multispectral images, which can be considered as a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
