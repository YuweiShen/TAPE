The approach involves learning a multi-level face model using a combination of different techniques, including convolutional neural networks (cs.GR), self-supervised learning (cs.LG), and parametric modeling (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of priors and regularization, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
