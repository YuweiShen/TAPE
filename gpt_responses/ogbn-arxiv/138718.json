This falls under the category of algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) as it involves designing mechanisms that incentivize agents to reveal their true preferences. The paper also uses techniques from computational complexity theory (cs.DS) to prove a lower bound on the approximation ratio of such mechanisms. Additionally, the paper discusses linear mechanisms, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and mechanism design (cs.EC). Finally, the paper uses information theory (cs.IT) to prove an impossibility result on the approximation ratio."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
