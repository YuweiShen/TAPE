Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Computational Social Choice and Mechanism Design). The paper also discusses the computational and axiomatic properties of these methods, which suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The visualization and experimental analysis of the methods could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
