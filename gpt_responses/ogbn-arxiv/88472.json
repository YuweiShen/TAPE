The paper also discusses the theoretical basis of the proposed technique, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The proposed approach can be applied in various applicative settings, such as stream reasoning, which involves managing large amounts of data and falls under the category of databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions that the proposed approach relieves designers of logic programs from controlling technical aspects of grounding engines and answer set systems, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper specifically mentions that it is under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), which is a journal focused on programming languages and systems (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
