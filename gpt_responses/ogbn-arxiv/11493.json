The problem of minimizing energy consumption is also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as energy-efficient computing is an important consideration in these fields. Finally, the use of preemption and migration of jobs suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
