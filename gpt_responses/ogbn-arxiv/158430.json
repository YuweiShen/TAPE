The problem also involves symbolic dynamics, which is a subfield of theoretical computer science (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the interest of specialists in the theory of graphs and deterministic automata, which are topics in computer science and discrete mathematics. Finally, the problem involves finding a solution based on certain conditions, which is related to computational complexity theory (cs.LO) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
