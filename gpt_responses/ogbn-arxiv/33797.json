This involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to extract pose descriptors, machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) to estimate emotional intensities, and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to equip robots with emotional intelligence. The paper also includes field tests on a physical robot (cs.RO) and focuses on human-robot interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
