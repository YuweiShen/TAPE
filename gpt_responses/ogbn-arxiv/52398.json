This involves training a deep neural network with two branches, one for generating the appearance of the target actor in various poses and the other for improving the generation of temporally coherent video renditions of unseen pose sequences. The paper involves computer vision (CV) techniques for generating videos, and machine learning (LG) techniques for training the deep generative network. It also involves multimedia (MM) techniques for working with video data, graphics (GR) techniques for generating visual content, and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for developing the generative model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.MM, cs.GR, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
