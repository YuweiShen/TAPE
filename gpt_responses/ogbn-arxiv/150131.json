The paper proposes scalable algorithms for this problem, which suggests that it is likely to be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The algorithms are based on reverse influence sampling and are designed to work with large datasets, which suggests that the paper may also be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The paper also discusses the use of marketing strategies and their impact on influence propagation, which suggests that it may be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well. Finally, the paper presents experimental results to compare its algorithm with other baseline algorithms, which suggests that it may also be categorized under cs.SOC (Computational Social Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
