The paper proposes a new semi-Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to address the challenge of establishing person-level correspondences across first- and third-person videos, which involves learning a joint embedding space for first- and third-person videos. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning sub-category cs.MM and the machine learning sub-category cs.LG. The paper also involves designing a new triplet loss function, which is a common technique in deep learning and suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence sub-category cs.AI. Finally, the paper deals with wearable cameras, which suggests that it may also belong to the human-computer interaction sub-category cs.HC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
