This fits well within the scope of cs.SE.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the use of Blockchain technology in finance and economics, and the need for trusted applications. This involves security and cryptography aspects, which fall under cs.CR.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Blockchain is a distributed technology, and the paper discusses the challenges of developing software for it. This makes cs.DC a likely sub-category.\n- cs.DL (Digital Libraries): This sub-category deals with the management and organization of digital information. While the paper does not directly address this, it does discuss the use of Blockchain in various fields, which may involve digital libraries.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the development of software for Blockchain applications, which may involve the use of specific programming languages and tools. This makes cs.PL a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
