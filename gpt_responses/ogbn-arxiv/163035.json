The paper also discusses the reduction of output alphabet size, which is a common technique in source coding (cs.SI). The algorithmic complexity of the code construction is analyzed, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the merging of subsets of output symbols, which is a technique used in graph theory and combinatorics (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses experimentation with polar codes over finite field alphabets, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
