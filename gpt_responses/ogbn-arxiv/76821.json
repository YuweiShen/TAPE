This topic is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves studying the achievable rate of communication systems. It also involves networked systems (cs.NI) as it deals with multi-antenna communications. The use of caching in the system makes it relevant to the subfield of caching (cs.CE) and the use of mathematical approximations suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
