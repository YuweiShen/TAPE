The paper also uses optimization techniques and algorithms, which are commonly studied in computer science (cs.DS, cs.IT). The use of black-box calls to welfare approximation suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the focus on revenue and welfare maximization is a core topic in computational economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
