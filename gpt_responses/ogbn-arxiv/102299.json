This problem is related to robotics (cs.RO), as it involves developing a local planner for the MAV. The paper also proposes a local exploration strategy that selects intermediate goals, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The MAV must be able to perceive and understand its environment, which involves computer vision (cs.CV). The system must be able to operate in real-time, which involves control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses simulations to evaluate the proposed system, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
