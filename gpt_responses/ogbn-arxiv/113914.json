The paper focuses on constructing hypergraphs to capture different types of similarity between data points, and using a discriminative hypergraph partitioning criterion to improve the clustering results. These topics are closely related to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), social and information networks (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
