The strategy is implemented with neural networks and employs a heuristic to create flexible divides with varying sizes of prediction horizons. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based strategy for time series prediction. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based strategy for time series prediction. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The strategy is implemented with neural networks, which suggests that the paper may belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): There is no direct connection to social networks, but the paper deals with time series prediction, which is relevant to information networks. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a modeling strategy for time series prediction, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
