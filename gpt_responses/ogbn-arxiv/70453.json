The use of parsing expressions and recognition-based semantics also suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and software engineering (SE) techniques. The paper also discusses language-preserving translations between different types of grammars, which falls under formal languages (FL) and computational linguistics (CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
