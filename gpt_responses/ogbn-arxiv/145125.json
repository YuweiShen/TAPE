The use of large antenna arrays is also mentioned, which is a common feature of wireless communication networks (cs.NI). The paper proposes a new modulation scheme, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas is also a topic in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the proposed scheme, which is a topic in computer networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
