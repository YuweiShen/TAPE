This topic falls under several sub-categories in computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), communication and security (cs.COMM), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). Given the focus on MIMO systems, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories. However, the paper also discusses the reduction of computation power, which could fall under cs.SY or cs.MM. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.COMM, cs.SY, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
