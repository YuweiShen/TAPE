The use of a convolutional network to predict both shape and pose suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The use of point clouds and differentiable projection suggests a focus on graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of an ensemble of pose predictors and distillation suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
