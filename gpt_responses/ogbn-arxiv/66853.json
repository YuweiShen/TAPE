The paper also introduces new structural and algorithmic results related to stable matchings, such as the sublattice of maximum weight stable matchings and the notion of macro-rotations. These topics are closely related to the fields of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
