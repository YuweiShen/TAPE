This involves interaction with the surrounding vehicles and optimizing a long-term reward. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Robotics (cs.RO), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
