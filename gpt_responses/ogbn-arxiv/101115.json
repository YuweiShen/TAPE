The algorithm also involves sampling and exploiting local structure and context-specific independence in the distribution, which are relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the algorithm has potential applications in control systems (cs.SY) due to its ability to perform inference efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
