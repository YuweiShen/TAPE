This is a classic problem in information theory and falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also considers the case of cooperative multiple access channels, which involves distributed state information, i.e., each transmitter has its individual channel knowledge. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of linear precoding, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and communication and information theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
