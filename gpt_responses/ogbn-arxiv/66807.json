The paper also discusses parallel algorithms, which could fall under the category of parallel computing (cs.CC) or performance analysis (cs.PF). Finally, the paper presents practical implementations, which could fall under the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
