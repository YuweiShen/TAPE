Moreover, the random nature of the number of active users can be modeled using probabilistic methods commonly used in social network analysis. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the concept of frequency sub-bands can be related to the frequency spectrum used for multimedia transmission. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a randomized frequency hopping scheme, which involves designing an algorithm for resource allocation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
