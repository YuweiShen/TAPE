This involves leveraging current understanding of memory consolidation and replay algorithms. The paper specifically proposes the use of generative memory for lifelong reinforcement learning, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), robotics (cs.RO), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
