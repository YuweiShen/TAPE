The use of experimental and observational studies to obtain data and make decisions also suggests a connection to the sub-categories of machine learning and computational engineering. The paper's focus on deriving theoretically sharp bounds on the probabilities of causation suggests a connection to the sub-category of cryptography, while the use of empirical data to solve attribution-related problems suggests a connection to the sub-category of social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
