The paper also models the channel as a linear periodically time-varying filter, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the capacity achieving transmission scheme, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and network infrastructure (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
