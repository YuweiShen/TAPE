The codes are constructed using finite field theory, which is also a common topic in coding theory (cs.CR). The paper also involves the use of self-orthogonal codes, which is a topic in algebraic coding theory (cs.DS). The codes are constructed for the purpose of quantum error correction, which is a topic in quantum information science (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the use of MDS codes, which is a topic in both coding theory and cryptography (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
