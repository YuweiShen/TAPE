Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algebraic structures and operations, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics) possible sub-categories. The construction of the non-commutative ring and the study of its properties may fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
