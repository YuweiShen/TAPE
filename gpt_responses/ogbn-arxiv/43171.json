Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves designing a Siamese tracker, which is a type of neural network architecture used in robotics (RO) and machine learning (LG). Additionally, the paper involves regularization techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG).
