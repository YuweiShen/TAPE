The paper also mentions the use of threshold queries, which are often used in information-retrieval and data-mining applications, suggesting that it could also belong to the information retrieval sub-category (cs.IR). The algorithms introduced in the paper are focused on improving the efficiency of bitmap indexes, which could also place it in the data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the broader applicability of bitmap indexes, which could also place it in the cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
