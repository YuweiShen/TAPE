The paper proposes modifications to the model and training to alleviate the issues of class imbalance and background filtering, which are common problems in machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also suggests new measures to complement existing ones, which is related to evaluation metrics in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of irrelevant relationships, which is related to multimodal learning (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
