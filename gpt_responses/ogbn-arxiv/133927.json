This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with resource allocation in a MECO system comprising multiple users that time share a single edge cloud. This involves distributed computing and falls under the scope of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper formulates the optimal resource allocation as a convex optimization problem and proposes a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm. This involves control theory and falls under the scope of systems and control.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper considers the problem of minimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under constraint on computation latency. This involves information theory and falls under the scope of cs.IT.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper proposes a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm to reduce the complexity of computing the threshold. This involves computational engineering and falls under the scope of cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
