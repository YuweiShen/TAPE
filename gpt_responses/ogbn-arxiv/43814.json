The method leverages deep learning (cs.CV) and filtering-based localisation (cs.SY) to improve the efficiency and precision of the localisation system. The use of deep learning also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
