This involves leveraging machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. The paper also evaluates the approach in a simulated environment in the domain of smart vehicles. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are software engineering (cs.SE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), systems and control (cs.SY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
