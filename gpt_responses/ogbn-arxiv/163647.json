The use of multiple servers and the focus on server-symmetric schemes suggest that the paper may also be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and networking (cs.SI). Finally, the study of capacity and rate in PIR-CSI schemes involves coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
