It may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it proposes a new method for detecting obstructed links based on RSS variation. Additionally, it may fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the proposed localization method uses a weighted least square approach. It could also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with localization in wireless environments. Finally, it may belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) as it involves the use of multiple channels for localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
