The subjective experiments involve eye fixation duration and point clicking, which are related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of precision-recall curves and mean absolute error for evaluation suggests a focus on machine learning and data analysis (cs.MM, cs.IR). Finally, the proposal of a new dataset and evaluation metrics suggests a focus on methodology and experimentation (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
