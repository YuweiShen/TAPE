It also addresses the issue of optimization in continuing tasks, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the connection between discounting and average reward, which is related to decision making and optimization in dynamic systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
