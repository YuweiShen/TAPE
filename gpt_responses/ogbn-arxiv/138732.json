The use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) and neural architecture search also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the study of hyperparameters in BO could also fall under the subfields of neural networks (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
