Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves crowd-sourcing and human assessment, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper also discusses the weaknesses of existing metrics, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
