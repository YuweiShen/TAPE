This falls under the scope of information theory, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of distributed antenna setups in cellular networks, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper analyzes the behavior of distributed massive MIMO systems with imperfect hardware, which can be viewed as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of data in cellular networks, which can be considered a multimedia application. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): This category is less likely, but the paper may have implications for the societal impact of cellular networks and their performance in real-world scenarios."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
