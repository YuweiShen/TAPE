This suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are likely categories. The focus on binary variables and pairwise couplings suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a likely category. The paper also discusses submodular functions, which are commonly studied in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
