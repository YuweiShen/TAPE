The approach involves training a meta network (meta learning), which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of evolutionary procedures, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL).
