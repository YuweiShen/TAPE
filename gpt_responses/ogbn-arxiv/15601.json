The distributed registration and tracking of multiple targets involve coordination and communication among the agents. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a consensus-based filtering approach for computing the posterior density of the multitarget set in each sensor node. This involves designing a suitable consensus protocol and analyzing the stability and convergence of the distributed algorithm. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper models the multitarget set as a random finite set and uses a probability hypothesis density filter for tracking. This is a common approach in computer vision and pattern recognition for handling multiple object tracking. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the registration of sensors in a network, which involves establishing connectivity and communication among the nodes. This is a key issue in networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a cost function for sensor registration. This is a fundamental concept in information theory for measuring the difference between probability distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
