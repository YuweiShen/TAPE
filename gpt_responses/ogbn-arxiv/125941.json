The use of reductions in these algorithms also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the evaluation of the effectiveness of these algorithms on real-world networks suggests a connection to network science (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
