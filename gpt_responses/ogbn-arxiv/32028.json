This falls under the category of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes incorporating phase constraints based on signal models, which involves temporal coherence and repetition of audio events. This falls under the category of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Statistical Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper provides an algorithm for estimating the model parameters, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
