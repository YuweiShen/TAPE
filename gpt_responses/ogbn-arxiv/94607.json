Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses breakthrough novel technology concepts, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). The paper also mentions channel modeling and antenna array design, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.PH (Physics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
