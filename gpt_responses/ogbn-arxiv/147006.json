This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses interference alignment schemes, which are commonly studied in the networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The use of MIMO technology and optimization techniques suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and computer engineering (cs.CE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
