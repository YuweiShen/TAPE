Specifically, the paper proposes the use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to explain individual network decisions, which is a method commonly used in neural network interpretability research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as the paper discusses the potential of DNNs for investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or decision-related processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
