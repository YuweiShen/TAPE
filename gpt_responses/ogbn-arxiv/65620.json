The focus on teaching agents to act in accordance with human social norms suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect to the research. The use of a hybrid team (agents and people) also suggests a multi-agent systems (cs.MA) aspect. The STAR framework may involve machine learning or reinforcement learning techniques, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.ML) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the use of agents suggests a robotics (cs.RO) aspect to the research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
