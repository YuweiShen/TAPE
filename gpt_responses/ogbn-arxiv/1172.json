The use of FPN and deep learning models also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The mention of edge devices and real-time processing suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of semi-supervised learning and knowledge distillation suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
