The use of a convolutional neural network also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The development of a similarity measure implies that it may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a learning-based solution suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of a neural network for metric learning suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
