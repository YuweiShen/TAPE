This suggests that the paper could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of a Gaussian Radial Basis Function Network (GRBFN) for biometric authentication suggests that the paper could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The evaluation of the algorithm on a database and the use of a score fusion approach suggest that the paper could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of eye movement dynamics and iris recognition technology suggests that the paper could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
