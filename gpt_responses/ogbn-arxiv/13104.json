Therefore, cs.CL and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SD). Finally, the paper discusses the social psychological theory and methodology, indicating a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
