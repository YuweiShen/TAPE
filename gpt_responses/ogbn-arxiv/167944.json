The proposed module involves motion enhancement and temporal interaction, which are related to multimedia processing (cs.MM). The paper also focuses on reducing computational cost, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the proposed module is designed to capture temporal structure effectively, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
