Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a deep neural network that can learn to detect and recognize text in a semi-supervised way, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed model on public benchmark datasets, which involves evaluation metrics and experimental results that are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
