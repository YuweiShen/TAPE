The paper specifically focuses on the challenges of using deep reinforcement learning and proposes a new algorithm to address these challenges. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the theoretical and empirical aspects of the proposed algorithm, which could potentially fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
