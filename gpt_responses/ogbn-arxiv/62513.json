The concept of nondominated strategies is also a central idea in game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an interpretation of McClennen's resolute choice, which is a decision-making strategy that can be implemented by artificial agents. The paper also proposes implementations of resolute choice that are computationally tractable. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of dynamic programming in decision making and proposes an alternative approach that is based on cooperation between successive selves of the decision maker. This approach can be seen as a form of learning. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes implementations of resolute choice that are computationally tractable. This requires the use of efficient algorithms and data structures. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper discusses decision making under uncertainty, which is a key topic in multiagent systems. The concept of nondominated strategies is also relevant in multiagent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
