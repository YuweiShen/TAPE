The problem involves determining the sizes of codes with certain properties, which is a combinatorial problem (cs.DM). The paper specifically focuses on ternary codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The problem involves determining the minimum distance of the codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses group divisible codes in its constructions, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
