The paper specifically focuses on the importance of word boundaries in character-level NMT, which is a topic that is closely related to Computational Linguistics (CL). Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also proposes a new hierarchical decoding architecture for character-level NMT, which involves training deeper networks and optimizing the translation at both the word and character levels. This approach requires a significant amount of computational resources and can benefit from techniques in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), such as regularization and optimization. Therefore, cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely sub-categories. \n\nMoreover, the paper evaluates the proposed method on the machine translation task from English into five languages with distinct morphological typology, which involves analyzing and processing large amounts of textual data. This task can benefit from techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), such as data augmentation and feature extraction. Therefore, cs.NE and cs.CV are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
