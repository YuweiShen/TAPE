The paper also deals with vision-based problems and image processing (cs.CV), as well as decision-making and policy approximation (cs.AI). The use of neural networks and sparse coding also falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the application of these techniques to robotics (cs.RO), specifically in the context of playing Atari games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
