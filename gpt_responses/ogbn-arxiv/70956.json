It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves developing a technique to reduce estimator variance. Additionally, the paper's focus on generative models and sampling techniques makes it relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of antithetic sampling to reduce variance is also relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
