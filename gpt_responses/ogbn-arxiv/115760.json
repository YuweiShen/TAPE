The paper also discusses a non-standard interpretation of SQL semantics, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper proposes a source-level SQL rewrite, which is a technique used in program analysis and verification (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed approach, which is a concern in software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential security implications of data provenance, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
