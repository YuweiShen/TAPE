The proposed receiver combines channel estimation, equalization, and data detection into a single operation, which can be seen as an information-theoretic problem. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper focuses on the design of a receiver for wireless communication systems that use OFDM transmission. The proposed receiver is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) and validated by Monte Carlo simulation, which are common metrics used in communication systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new system design for wireless communication systems that use OFDM transmission. The proposed receiver combines channel estimation, equalization, and data detection into a single operation, which can be seen as a system-level problem. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new receiver design for wireless communication systems that use OFDM transmission. The proposed receiver can be seen as a networking problem, as it aims to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for direct data detection of OFDM signals over wireless channels. The proposed algorithm combines channel estimation, equalization, and data detection into a single operation, which can be seen as"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
