The paper also uses techniques from graph theory (cs.DS) and linear programming (cs.DM), and discusses the eigenvalues of the random walk matrix (cs.IT) which are commonly used in spectral graph theory. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of linear programming hierarchies for CSPs, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.TH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
