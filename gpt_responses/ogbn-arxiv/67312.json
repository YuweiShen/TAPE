It also involves network resource allocation, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper proposes a modified online saddle-point (MOSP) scheme, which is a control algorithm and thus related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses numerical experiments to compare the performance of MOSP with the stochastic dual gradient method, which is a common optimization algorithm in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
