It also discusses the transmission of analog sources over a Gaussian channel, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). The presence of side information known only to the receiver is a common problem in source coding, which falls under the sub-category of source coding with side information (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of hybrid digital analog codes, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
