The library is built on top of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the library focuses on few-shot classification and regression, which are common tasks in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) research. The paper also mentions extensions for PyTorch to simplify the development of models, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
