The paper also mentions the redesigning of neurons and links, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the construction of rule libraries for expert systems, which is a topic related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computational complexity (cs.CC).
