The proposed system incorporates an empirical method to determine the flavour of food and uses major gustatory nerves to suggest food items that the user is more likely to enjoy based on their flavour profile. This involves the use of taste biological domain knowledge, which falls under the category of computational biology (cs.CB). However, the paper primarily focuses on the application of this mechanism in food recommendation systems, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) to extract flavour-related information from textual data. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential impact of this mechanism on user experience and quality of life, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
