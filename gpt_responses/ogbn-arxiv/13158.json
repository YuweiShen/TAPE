Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses different strategies for pooling, normalization, and choice of CNN layers, which are related to machine learning and deep learning techniques, making cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also evaluates its approach on a dataset, which falls under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a fusion approach that combines CNN- and motion-based features, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
