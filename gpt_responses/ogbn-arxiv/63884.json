The paper also discusses policy iteration and its convergence, which is a common technique used in machine learning and reinforcement learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The theoretical comparison between policy iteration and value iteration suggests a focus on optimization and decision-making algorithms (cs.RO). Finally, the extension of the convergence results to multi-step look-ahead policy iteration suggests a focus on neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
