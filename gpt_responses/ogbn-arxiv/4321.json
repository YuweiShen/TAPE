The practical constraints of voting systems and the need for usability suggest a focus on computer systems and algorithms (cs.DS). The tension between privacy and evidence of correct outcomes involves cryptography (cs.CY). The need to convince the electorate of the correctness of election outcomes suggests a focus on statistical methods (cs.LG). Finally, the need for usable security suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
