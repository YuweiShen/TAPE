The paper proposes a new deep architecture for this task, which involves using bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) to generate multiple positional sentence representations and aggregating them to produce a matching score. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
