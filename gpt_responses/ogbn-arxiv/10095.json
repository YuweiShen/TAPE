The paper specifically focuses on the communication bottleneck that arises in distributed optimization and proposes a novel framework for addressing this issue. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under the sub-categories of distributed computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
