This involves aspects of electronic design automation (EDA), circuit design, and hardware implementation, which are covered by the cs.ET (Electronic Design Automation) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of empirical models to estimate RC parasitic, which falls under the cs.EM (Electromagnetics) sub-category. The focus on interconnects and their impact on system performance suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning accelerators suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
