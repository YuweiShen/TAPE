The paper proposes a new approach based on complex tensor factorization, which is a technique commonly used in linear algebra and data analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper also discusses the scalability and performance of the proposed approach, which are topics related to distributed systems and algorithms. Therefore, cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
