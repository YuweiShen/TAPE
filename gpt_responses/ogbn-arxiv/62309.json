The focus on scientific papers suggests a connection to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) as well. Additionally, the goal of improving automatic summarization systems suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DL (Machine Learning), followed by cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
