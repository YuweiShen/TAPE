The approach involves selecting appropriate word and phrase level paraphrase pairs from an off-the-shelf dictionary and generating fluent natural language sentences. This work is related to natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
