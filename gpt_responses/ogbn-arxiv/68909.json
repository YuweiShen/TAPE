This involves handling spatial and angular information, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of deep learning (cs.AI) and the evaluation of performance (cs.LG) are also important aspects of the paper. Finally, the development of synthetic and real-world datasets (cs.MM) for evaluation further supports these likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
