The paper also discusses the challenges of scalability in high-dimensional datasets, which is a common problem in data mining (cs.DM) and database systems (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of outlier detection in high-stakes fields like finance and security, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
