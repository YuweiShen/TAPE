This involves estimating reference planes for points in noisy point clouds using a neural network. The paper also conducts experiments on 3D data from ShapeNet and ModelNet10. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR), as the paper deals with 3D point clouds and surface estimation. Machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE) are also likely sub-categories, given the use of deep learning techniques in the proposed algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
