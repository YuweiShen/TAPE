This involves the use of shape analysis and mapping between modes and task descriptions. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these are the areas where ZSL is commonly used. Additionally, the paper also involves the use of simulation and optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
