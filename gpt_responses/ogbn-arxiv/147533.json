This is a key area of research in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper focuses on the delivery of files to users through a wireless network and proposes a system that is reminiscent of eMBMS. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed system involves multiple antennas and simultaneous transmission from different ENs, which requires coordination and control. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The proposed system is designed for the delivery of files from a content library to users, which is a key area of research in multimedia. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a system that is fully scalable and can support an arbitrarily large number of users, which requires efficient data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
