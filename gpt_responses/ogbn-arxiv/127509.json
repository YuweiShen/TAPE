It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep neural networks are a popular tool in AI research. Additionally, the paper mentions computer vision (cs.CV) as an application area for their proposed method. The use of ensemble methods and information theory also suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
