The proposed method involves dictionary learning, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. The paper also mentions the use of sparse coding algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research.
