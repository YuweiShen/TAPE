This topic is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including discrete mathematics (cs.DM), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, given the focus on graph symmetries, cs.DM and cs.DS are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CG, cs.AI, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
