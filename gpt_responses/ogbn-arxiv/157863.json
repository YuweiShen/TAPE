The concept of delay is also central to the paper, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the redundancy of different coding schemes, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The use of sequential codes, such as delay-limited arithmetic codes, could also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper could be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) as it discusses the computational complexity of different coding schemes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
