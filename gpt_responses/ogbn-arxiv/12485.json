The paper also focuses on the use of explicit domain supervision, which involves classification networks and feature extraction, indicating a strong emphasis on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The experiments involve multiple datasets and image types, suggesting a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
