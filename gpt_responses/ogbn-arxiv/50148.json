The paper also proposes new algorithms based on semidefinite programming, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses approximation ratios and worst-case analysis, which are common topics in theoretical computer science (cs.IT) and similarity-based clustering, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
