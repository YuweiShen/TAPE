This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework also involves capturing the geometry of the underlying state space, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions using state embeddings for linear value function approximation, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
