The use of convex functions and likelihood ratios also suggests a possible connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Statistics (cs.SI). Finally, the application to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and channel uncertainty suggests a possible connection to Multimedia (cs.MM), where such noise and uncertainty are common in signal processing applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
