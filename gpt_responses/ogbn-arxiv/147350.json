The proposed approach involves a deep neural network that learns to capture both semantic and spatial relations between labels, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach also involves attention maps and convolutions, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
