The paper also discusses functional dependence constraints, which are related to information theory and proof theory (cs.ITP). The topic of Shannon-type inequalities is also relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the characterization of a minimal set of inequalities, which is related to discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
