This requires addressing technical challenges related to power, size, weight, and self-localization, which are typical concerns in robotics.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the use of bumblebees as the platform for their experiments. This involves understanding the behavior and capabilities of the insects, which could potentially involve neural and evolutionary computing techniques.\n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a novel approach to creating a mobile IoT platform using live insects, which could be considered an emerging technology.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper discusses the use of multiple insects as a mobile IoT platform, which could potentially involve coordination and communication between the agents.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the technical challenges of integrating sensing, computing, and communication functionalities onto live insects, which could involve systems and control techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
