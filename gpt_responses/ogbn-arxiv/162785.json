The scheme is based on logistic map, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The encryption scheme is specifically designed for multimedia data, which includes images (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of chaotic states, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the encryption of images, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
