This involves learning an efficient reward shaping function on a distribution of tasks, assuming only shared state space but not necessarily action space. The paper also derives the theoretically optimal reward shaping in terms of credit assignment in model-free RL. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also deals with control systems (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
