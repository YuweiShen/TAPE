Information theory is closely related to coding theory, and polar codes are a type of error-correcting code used in information theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses reducing decoding latency, which is related to computational complexity. The proposed scheme aims to reduce the time required for decoding polar codes, which is a computational task. \n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new construction scheme for polar codes, which are used in communication systems. The proposed scheme aims to improve the efficiency of decoding, which is a control problem in communication systems. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses improving the efficiency of decoding polar codes, which are used in communication systems. Communication systems are closely related to networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new construction scheme for polar codes that aims to reduce decoding latency. This involves designing algorithms and data structures for decoding polar codes efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
