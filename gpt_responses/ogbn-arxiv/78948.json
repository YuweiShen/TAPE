The paper also discusses the use of quantitative modeling and prediction, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The operational range estimation is crucial for safe mission completion, which relates to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents performance metrics, which could fall under the category of mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
