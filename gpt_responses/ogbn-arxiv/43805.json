Therefore, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The problem also has practical applications in recommender systems and information retrieval, which fall under the sub-category of cs.IR. The algorithms presented in the paper involve optimization and analysis of regret, which are topics studied in the sub-field of optimization and algorithms, cs.DS. Finally, the paper also discusses experiments and empirical results, which are commonly studied in the sub-field of computational experiments, cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
