This suggests a focus on network infrastructure and communication technologies, which falls under the category of Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI). The paper specifically mentions the use of edge caching in four areas: Smart Cities, Vehicular Content Networks, Healthcare, and Virtual Reality Videos. These areas involve the use of multimedia content, which falls under the category of Multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the need for low latency, which is a concern in the field of Information Theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of edge caching for improving network performance, which is a topic in the field of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the potential benefits of edge caching for improving network security, which falls under the category of Cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
