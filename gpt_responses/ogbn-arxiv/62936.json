The use of wireless-powered untrusted relays is also a topic of interest in communication and networking research, which falls under cs.CR. The paper also mentions the use of constellation rotation (CR) approach, which is a technique used in digital signal processing and modulation (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed scheme involves the use of time switching (TS) architecture, which is a technique used in wireless communication systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
