The use of deep-Q-network architecture and recurrence in the proposed system suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on self-driving agents and robotics indicates that it could also belong to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of neural substrates and brain inspiration suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of raw screen outputs and modified replay mechanism suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
