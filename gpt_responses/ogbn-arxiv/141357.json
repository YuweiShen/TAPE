The paper also uses information theoretic tools and approaches, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the privacy of groups of individuals and the privacy of multiple queries, which could fall under the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB).
