This involves control and optimization of the network system.\n- cs.CY (Computational Geometry): Although not directly related to geometry, the paper involves analyzing the topology and connectivity of the low-voltage network to ensure that network constraints are not violated during P2P energy trading.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly mentions the use of blockchain technology in P2P energy trading schemes, which may involve cryptographic techniques for secure transactions.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): P2P energy trading involves distributed computing among the users in the network, and the paper proposes a decentralized approach to energy trading without the need for a central intermediary.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper may involve game-theoretic analysis of the incentives and strategies of users in P2P energy trading schemes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
