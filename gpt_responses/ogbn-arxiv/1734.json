Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also makes use of end-to-end learning and novel architectures, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper evaluates its method on single and cross-domain category retrieval, instance retrieval, and classification, indicating that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a novel block-softmax non-linearity and batch-based entropy losses, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
