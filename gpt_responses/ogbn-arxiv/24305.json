Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves network infrastructure and protocols, which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as the second likely sub-category. The paper uses statistical methods to analyze localization error, which suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MA (Machine Learning) as the third and fourth likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses analytical expressions to derive the distribution of the CRLB, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the fifth likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
