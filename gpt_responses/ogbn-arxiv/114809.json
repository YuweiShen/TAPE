The use of cooperative feedback to mitigate the overhead due to CSI feedback is a system-level approach, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of scalar feedback signals to control transmitter power, which is related to machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
