The paper also heavily relies on computer vision (cs.CV) techniques to build a 3D map of the environment and recognize objects. The proposed algorithm also involves machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical modeling (cs.LG) to improve object recognition accuracy. Finally, the paper discusses the role of human input in the form of crowd sourcing (cs.HC) to improve object recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
