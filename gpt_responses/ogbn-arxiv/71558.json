The paper could potentially fit into this category if the moderators do not feel that it fits well into any of the other categories. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of uncertainty in anchor node positions, which is a problem that is often encountered in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
