This involves image analysis and computer vision, which are typically covered in the computer science sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also introduces a novel attentive feature pyramid fusion module and regression-voting technique, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with medical imaging, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the generalization capability and stability of the proposed method, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
