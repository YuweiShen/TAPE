This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of short connections and cross-training, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a multi-scale approach, which is also commonly used in neural network research related to natural language processing (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
