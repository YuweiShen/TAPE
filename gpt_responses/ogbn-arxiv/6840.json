The proposed toolkit includes exploration of rare event sets and construction of accelerated distributions for Gaussian Mixture models using Importance Sampling techniques. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and statistical modeling.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new framework for evaluating risks of automated vehicles, which involves the use of statistical models and simulation techniques. These are common tools used in artificial intelligence research.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the evaluation of risks for automated vehicles, which is a topic of interest in robotics research. The proposed framework could be useful for testing and evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles.\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new testing approach for automated vehicles, which involves the use of statistical models and simulation techniques. These are common tools used in software engineering for testing and evaluating software systems.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the evaluation of risks for automated vehicles, which is a topic of interest in systems and control research.
