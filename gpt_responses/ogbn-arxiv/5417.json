The use of switching operations and edge-colouring also suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.DS) and combinatorics (cs.CC). Finally, the dichotomy theorem mentioned in the abstract suggests a possible connection to computational complexity theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
