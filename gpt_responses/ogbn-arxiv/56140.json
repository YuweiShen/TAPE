Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the process of knowledge distillation, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new loss function and attempts to boost the complexity of the small network, which are both related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the redundancy of parameters in large networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with pedestrian detection, which is a subfield of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
