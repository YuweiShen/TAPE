The use of sub-word level basic units is a common technique in NLP, and therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the impact of different decoder parameters and data formats on translation accuracy, which is related to machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with phrase-based SMT, which is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as it discusses the impact of data format on decoding time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
