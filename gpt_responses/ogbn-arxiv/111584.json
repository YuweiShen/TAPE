The use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) suggests a signal processing approach, which is often associated with the cs.AR sub-category. The focus on image recognition and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suggests the cs.CV sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of model size on performance and energy efficiency, which is relevant to the cs.LG sub-category. The testing of the proposed method on FPGA, ASIC, and embedded processors suggests the cs.SY sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the hardware implementation of the proposed method, which is relevant to the cs.ET sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
