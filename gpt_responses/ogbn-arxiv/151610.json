The paper also discusses semi-supervised learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to reduce the annotation budget, which is related to active learning and optimization (cs.AI). The paper presents results on the Pascal VOC benchmark, which is a common dataset in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of weakly-supervised learning, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
