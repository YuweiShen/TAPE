The paper also uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to learn good scheduling principles, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents an approximate analysis of the performance of the scheduling policy, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and performance analysis (cs.PF). Finally, the paper compares the performance of scheduling with redundancy to the widely deployed remedy of relaunching straggler tasks, which is related to optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
