The paper focuses on optimizing the scheduling to maximize the number of flows satisfying their QoS requirements with relays exploited to overcome blockage. This problem is primarily related to the field of networking (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper deals with the use of mmWave technology (cs.MM) and the design of a practical solution (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the impact of relay selection parameter on the performance of the proposed scheme, which is related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
