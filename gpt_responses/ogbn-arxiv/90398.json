This is a topic related to machine learning and optimization, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper focuses on the reduction of computational cost, which is a common concern in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for binarization, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
