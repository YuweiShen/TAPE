The paper proposes a novel online machine learning framework for detecting malware, which involves capturing security-sensitive behaviors from apps and using an online passive-aggressive classifier to adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), software engineering (cs.SE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI) as these areas are relevant to the proposed framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
