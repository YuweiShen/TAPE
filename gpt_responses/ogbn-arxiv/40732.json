The proposed algorithm is based on the Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP) framework, which is widely used in information theory and signal processing. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely categories. The problem of blind self-calibration and dictionary learning from nonlinear measurements suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The problem of one-bit matrix completion suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the problem of quantized compressed sensing with matrix uncertainty suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
