These applications are typically studied in the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Multimedia (cs.MM), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories of arXiv CS. The paper specifically focuses on the state evolution of AMP with non-separable functions, which is a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance. This analysis is likely to be of interest to researchers in the above-mentioned sub-categories, hence the paper is likely to belong to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
