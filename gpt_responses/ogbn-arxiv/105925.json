This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of a linear programming decoder, which is commonly used in network coding (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The concept of thresholding is also relevant in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
