The paper also discusses metrics for measuring understandability, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The experiments conducted in the paper involve manipulating data in spreadsheets, which could be considered a data management task (cs.DB). Finally, the paper could also be relevant to cybernetics (cs.CY) as it deals with the interaction between humans and computer systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
