The use of one-bit ADCs in massive MIMO systems also involves signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper mentions the propagation loss in millimeter wave MIMO communications, which is a topic related to mobile computing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
