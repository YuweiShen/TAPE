This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper deals with numerical methods for linear algebra, specifically Gaussian elimination and matrix decomposition. This is a subfield of numerical analysis. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses matrix transformations and decompositions, which are commonly used in machine learning algorithms. \n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper discusses algorithms for computing matrix invariants, which is a subfield of symbolic computation. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the CUP algorithm, which can be used for computing the inverse of a matrix.
