The problem involves reconstructing a sparse vector from intensity-only measurements. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of combinatorial techniques, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of near-optimal number of measurements, which is a common theme in the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
