The paper specifically discusses minimax tree search, which is a common technique in game-playing programs and falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the size of search trees and graphs, which relates to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper proposes new ideas for enhancing Alpha-Beta search, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper uses empirical evidence and computational analysis, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
