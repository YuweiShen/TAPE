Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper uses pruning and contraction hierarchies, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and database systems (cs.DB) for efficient query processing. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on large graphs, which is relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
