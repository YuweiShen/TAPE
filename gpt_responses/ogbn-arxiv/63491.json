This makes cs.CY a likely category for this paper.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of machine learning classifiers to support content moderation and curation work in peer production projects like Wikipedia. This makes cs.SI a likely category for this paper.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the development of interfaces and automated agents that act on predictions made by ORES. This makes cs.HC a likely category for this paper.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of machine learning classifiers to score wiki edits in real-time. This makes cs.IR a likely category for this paper.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets to score wiki edits. This makes cs.LG a likely category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
