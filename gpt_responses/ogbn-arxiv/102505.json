The proposed attack is a black box Neural Network extraction attack that exploits timing side channels. This makes cs.CR the most likely category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the vulnerability of Neural Networks to attacks and proposes a method to reconstruct substitute models with test accuracy close to the target models. This makes cs.LG a likely category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper uses VGG architectures on CIFAR10 dataset to test the proposed approach. This makes cs.CV a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a method that uses Reinforcement Learning with knowledge distillation to reduce the search space to infer a target model. This makes cs.SY a possible category.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a method to reconstruct substitute models with test accuracy close to the target models. This makes cs.SE a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
