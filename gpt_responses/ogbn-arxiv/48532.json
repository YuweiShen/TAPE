The use of received signal strength to estimate the position of the robots is a common technique in wireless sensor networks and localization (cs.MA). The paper also presents a method for segmenting the obstacle-occupied region in the unknown domain, which involves processing and analyzing data, making it relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of coordinating a swarm of robots to explore an unknown domain, which is a typical problem in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
