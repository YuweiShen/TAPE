The proposed method utilizes the self-attention mechanism, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG), and also involves improving the recognition power of the model (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing techniques such as attention mechanisms (cs.CL) and the experiments are conducted on image datasets (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
