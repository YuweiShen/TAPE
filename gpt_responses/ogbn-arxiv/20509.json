The paper leverages over 593K calendar events to learn user preferences and understand calendar contexts based on natural language. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques for language-related tasks. The paper uses natural language processing techniques to understand calendar contexts, which makes it highly likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with machine learning, reasoning, and decision-making techniques. The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for event scheduling, which makes it highly likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with various machine learning techniques and algorithms. The paper uses deep neural networks such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, and Highway Network for learning user preferences and understanding calendar contexts, which makes it highly likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with techniques for retrieving relevant information from large datasets. The paper leverages over 593K calendar events to learn user preferences and understand calendar contexts, which makes it somewhat likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.HC"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
