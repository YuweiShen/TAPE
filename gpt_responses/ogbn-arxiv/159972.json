The authors propose a new formulation of the problem using a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the generated videos using various metrics, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
