The codes also have applications in authentication and secret sharing schemes, which fall under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of these codes in association schemes and data storage systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computer networks (cs.CC). Finally, the codes' potential applications in consumer electronics and communication systems suggest that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
