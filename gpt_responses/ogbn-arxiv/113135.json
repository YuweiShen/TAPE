The proposed method involves multi-task learning (MTL) and distance map regularization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models for segmentation, which is a popular topic in the computer science (CS) community. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
