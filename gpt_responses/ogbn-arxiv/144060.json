Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses neural models, which suggests that it could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of using development sets on accuracy, which could be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions tasks such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, which could be related to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
