Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a parameter initialization method that can ensure convergence, which is related to optimization and machine learning theory, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also discusses the computation order of residual connection and layer normalization, which is related to the architecture of the model, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible category. The proposed approach can also be applied to computer vision tasks, as deep Transformers have been used in image captioning and visual question answering, making cs.CV (Computer Vision) another possible category. Finally, the paper uses experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is related to neural networks and optimization, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
