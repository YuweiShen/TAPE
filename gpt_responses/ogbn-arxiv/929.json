This problem is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS), as well as to optimization and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of graph connectivity as a metric, which is relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
