This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper proposes a new method for feature recombination and recalibration, which involves the use of linear expansion and compression, and a segmentation SE (SegSE) block. These methods are related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed methods using publicly available data, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
