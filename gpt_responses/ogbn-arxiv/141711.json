The method involves intensity modulation and direct detection, which are also relevant topics in communication systems (cs.COMM). The channel is modeled as a bandlimited channel with nonnegative input, which is a physical constraint that is often considered in communication systems (cs.PHY). The paper also discusses the use of Nyquist and root-Nyquist pulses, which are commonly used in digital signal processing and communication systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper investigates the trade-off between power and bandwidth, which is a fundamental problem in networked systems and communication networks (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
