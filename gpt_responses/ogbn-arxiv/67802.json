The proposed algorithms are based on polynomial-time methods, which are often used in computational complexity theory (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses simulation results, which may fall under the category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
