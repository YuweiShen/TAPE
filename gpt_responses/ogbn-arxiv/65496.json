This involves the use of computer vision algorithms and onboard sensing, which falls under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of task-driven methodologies, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using real-world experiments, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
