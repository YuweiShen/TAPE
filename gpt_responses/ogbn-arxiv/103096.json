The use of an entropy constraint is also a common technique in information theory (cs.ITP). The paper also involves optimization algorithms (cs.LG) and numerical experiments (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of the results to continuous output channels, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
