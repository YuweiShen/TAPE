The use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of unconstrained face detection datasets suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method compared to other face detection algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
