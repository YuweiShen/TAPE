Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also mentions that the DSL is embedded in F*, a verification-oriented programming language, which suggests that cs.PL (Programming Languages) is another likely sub-category. The paper also formalizes a deep embedding of Wys* in F* to reason about the distributed runtime semantics of the programs, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper mentions implementing several MPC protocols, which could fall under cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper discusses verifying the correctness and security of the implemented protocols, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
