The model uses a Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural Network to embed the passage and a hybrid evaluator with a mixed objective combining both cross-entropy and RL losses to ensure the generation of syntactically and semantically valid text. The paper focuses on natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question generation, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of reinforcement learning and graph neural networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
