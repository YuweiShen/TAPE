Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of machine learning algorithms for text summarization makes cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper proposes a new metric for automated evaluation of summaries based on topic modelling, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
