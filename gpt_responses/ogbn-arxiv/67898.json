The paper also focuses on the training procedure of these networks, which is a common topic in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed methodology involves the use of matrix computations, which is a topic in both artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper includes experiments on visual segmentation, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
