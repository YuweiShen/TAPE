The problem of detecting and handling sensor defects is a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a learning-based algorithm for distributed estimation, which is related to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
