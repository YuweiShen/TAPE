This involves addressing several open challenges including model overfitting, reducing the number of parameters, and handling severely imbalanced data in CXR. The paper proposes a novel architecture that combines delayed subsampling, exponential linear units, highly restrictive regularization, and a large number of high-resolution low-level abstract features. The paper also demonstrates that the proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all considered organs, as well as the human observer on lungs and heart. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques for medical imaging, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MED (Medical Imaging), and cs.NEURON (Neurons and Cognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
