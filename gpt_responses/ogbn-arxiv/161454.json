The proposed method involves a memory-based meta-learning framework, which involves designing controllers to extract and store shape-discriminative features and shape priors in external memory. This approach involves machine learning techniques, such as meta-learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of shape priors, which is a common topic in computer graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.GR, and cs.RO, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
