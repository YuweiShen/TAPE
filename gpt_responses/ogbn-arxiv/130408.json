The use of contextualized language models (ELMo and BERT) for this task falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed joint approach (CEDR) also involves classification, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve TREC benchmarks, which are commonly used in information retrieval and text classification tasks, and may also involve computer vision (cs.CV) if the benchmarks include image retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
