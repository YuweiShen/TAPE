The paper also discusses the study of Khot's Unique Games Conjecture, which is a well-known problem in theoretical computer science and falls under the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses hypercontractivity, which is a concept commonly used in machine learning and falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
