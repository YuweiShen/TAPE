The paper also proposes a new approach to differential privacy, which involves discounting privacy losses over time, and uses Laplace noise to preserve privacy (cs.LG). The use of time series data and the focus on privacy preservation in databases also suggests relevance to the sub-categories of cs.DB and cs.IT. Finally, the application of the proposed method to smart-meter measurement time-series data suggests relevance to the sub-category of cs.SI (smart infrastructure)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
