The paper also proposes a novel framework for continuous-level learning, which involves training the network on multiple levels, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a non-linear module and regularization techniques also suggests the possibility of neural network optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's focus on image processing tasks indicates a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
