The focus on local termination also suggests a connection to formal methods and program verification (cs.SE), while the use of well-founded monotone algebras points to a connection with semantics and category theory (cs.SC). Finally, the application to combinatory logic suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
