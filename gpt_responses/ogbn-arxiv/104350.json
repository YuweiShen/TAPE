The paper proposes a new mechanism for training deep detectors without using sampling heuristics, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of loss weights and initialization strategy, which are topics related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed mechanism on the COCO benchmark, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
