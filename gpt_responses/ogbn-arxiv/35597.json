The use of pre-trained models and the development of a library for composing queries suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the accuracy of the detection, which could fall under the category of statistical learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of queries for retrieving video clips suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
