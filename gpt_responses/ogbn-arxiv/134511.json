The focus is on compressing the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the advantages of Bloom embeddings in terms of training time speedups and space requirements, which are relevant topics in data science (cs.DS) and database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
