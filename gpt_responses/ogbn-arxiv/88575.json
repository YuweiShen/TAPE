The paper also discusses the modeling and validation of hardware effects on the communication performance, which is relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed model for calculating expected throughput is also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as it can be used to design new MAC algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
