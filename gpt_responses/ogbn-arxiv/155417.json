The paper proposes a hierarchical method that uses deep learning techniques to tackle this problem. The paper is likely to be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image analysis and matching. It may also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses deep learning techniques. Multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) are also possible categories as the proposed method can be applied to multimedia analysis and robotics applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
