This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.BIO (Computational Biology): The paper uses blood perfusion data to derive discriminating facial thermograms for better classification and recognition of face images. This falls under the domain of computational biology. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a five layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network for classification. This falls under the domain of neural computing. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with processing and analyzing infra-red face images to extract blood perfusion data for face recognition. This falls under the domain of multimedia. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper proposes a face recognition system that can be used for human identification and authentication. This falls under the domain of human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
