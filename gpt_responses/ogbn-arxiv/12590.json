Specifically, it extends the characterization of $\\vpws$ to other complexity classes using branching programs with memory. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
