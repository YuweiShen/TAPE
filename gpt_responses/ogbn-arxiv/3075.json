The paper proposes a new convex formulation of the problem and analyzes its performance under Gaussian measurements. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
