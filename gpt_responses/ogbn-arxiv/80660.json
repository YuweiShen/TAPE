The paper discusses the challenges of using GANs and proposes a new system called AuthorGAN to make it easier for people to create and use GANs. The paper includes a survey of practitioners in the field and focuses on improving the reproducibility of GAN models. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
