This involves analyzing the social and information networks of the crowdfunding market, which falls under the scope of cs.SI.\n\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the crowdfunding market and its impact on society, as well as the challenges faced by creators and platforms in estimating early fundraising performance. This falls under the scope of cs.CY, which deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing.\n\n3. cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) - The paper analyzes the market competition and market evolution in the crowdfunding market, which involves studying social and economic networks. This falls under the scope of cs.SOC, which deals with the analysis of social and economic networks.\n\n4. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The paper proposes a model for estimating the early fundraising performance of crowdfunding projects, which involves analyzing the behavior of multiple agents (i.e., creators and backers) in the market. This falls under the scope of cs.MA, which deals with the study of multiagent systems.\n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes two graph-based neural network architectures for modeling market competition and market evolution, which involves using machine learning techniques.
