This involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of antenna selection to achieve secrecy, which involves techniques from networking (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of the number of active transmit antennas on the system's robustness, which involves techniques from signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
