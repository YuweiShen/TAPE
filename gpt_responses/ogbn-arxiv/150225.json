Specifically, the paper proposes a new transfer Q-learning method and analyzes its convergence rate. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves the study of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which is a topic in control theory and optimization, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category as well. Finally, the paper involves theoretical analysis and experiments, which could also place it under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
