The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in both machine learning and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of 3D virtual reality environments suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV), and the mention of solving tasks without strong simplifying assumptions suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
