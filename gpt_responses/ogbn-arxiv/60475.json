The paper also discusses the use of neural architecture search (NAS) to optimize the network structure, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses large-scale face datasets, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
