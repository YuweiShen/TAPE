The paper also mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are popular deep learning techniques used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also discusses the benefits of integrating CNNs and LSTMs, which is a topic related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of different sentiment classification levels, which could be related to information retrieval and search engines. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with Arabic language sentiment analysis, which is a specific area of research. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
