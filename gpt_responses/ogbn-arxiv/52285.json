The paper presents a new logic called arbitrary arrow update model logic (AAUML) and establishes arrow update synthesis. The paper also discusses the differences in update expressivity between arrow update logics, action model logics, and refinement modal logic. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
