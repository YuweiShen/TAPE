The proposed approach involves defining a novel distance measure between tokenized strings and developing a scalable distributed framework for performing similarity joins. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), cybersecurity (cs.CR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
