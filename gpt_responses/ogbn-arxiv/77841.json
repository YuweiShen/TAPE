The paper also introduces a new approach using dense local features, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep neural networks also falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the PASCAL VOC dataset, which is a common benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
