The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised learning and word embeddings, which are relevant to the sub-categories of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on a specific task, temporal relation extraction, which falls under the sub-category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE).
