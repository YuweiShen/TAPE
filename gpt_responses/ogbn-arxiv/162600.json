The paper proposes a new network architecture that focuses on reducing training time while maintaining high accuracy and fast inference speed. This suggests that the paper could also belong to sub-categories related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO), as these fields often deal with optimizing training time and efficiency. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on the MS COCO dataset, which is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
