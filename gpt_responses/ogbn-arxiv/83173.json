This involves using succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARK) and ML-specific optimizations to ensure that ML tasks are correctly executed on an untrusted server and the resource consumption claimed by the service provider equals the actual workload. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses security and integrity issues in MLaaS and proposes a framework to address them. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper focuses on MLaaS and proposes a framework to ensure the correctness of ML tasks. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of powerful servers for MLaaS and proposes a framework to ensure the fairness of resource consumption. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes ML-specific optimizations to the arithmetic circuit required by SNARK. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework for MLaaS, which involves developing software for ensuring integrity and fair payments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
