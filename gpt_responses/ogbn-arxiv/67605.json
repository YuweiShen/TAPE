It also uses the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used in computer vision research. \n\nIt could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it involves the development of a neural network and improving its accuracy. \n\nThe neural network architecture and training process may also fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the use of wavelet-like patterns to modulate the phase of optical waves may relate to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as it could potentially be used in robotic vision systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
