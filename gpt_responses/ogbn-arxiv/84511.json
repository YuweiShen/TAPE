Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks and attention mechanisms, which are common topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of mobile robots and instrumented vehicles, indicating a focus on robotics and control, making cs.RO (Robotics) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of panoramic images, which are commonly used in multimedia applications, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
