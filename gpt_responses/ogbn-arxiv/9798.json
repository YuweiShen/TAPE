The paper also introduces a novel type system that combines polymorphic refinement types with potential annotations of automatic amortized resource analysis. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages sub-category.\n\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper presents a type system that enables efficient constraint-based type checking and can express precise refinement-based resource bounds. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Logic in Computer Science sub-category.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a technique for synthesizing programs that are correct by construction and can leverage user-provided resource bounds to guide the search. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Software Engineering sub-category.\n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper evaluates the technique on a range of recursive data structure manipulations and shows that the synthesized programs are asymptotically more efficient than those generated by a resource-agnostic synthesizer. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category.\n\n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper presents a type system that combines polymorphic refinement types with potential annotations of automatic amortized resource analysis.
