The use of group Fourier matrices suggests that the paper may also fall under computational geometry (cs.CG) or discrete structures (cs.DS). The application of the frames to compressive sensing and quantum measurement operators suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
