Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the ability of these models to exploit superficial cues, which relates to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The analysis of BERT's and RoBERTa's performance on the benchmark involves neural networks (cs.NE) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
