The use of submodular valuation functions suggests a connection to Discrete Mathematics (cs.DS) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), where submodularity is a common concept. Finally, the study of equilibria and optimization in auctions is also relevant to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
