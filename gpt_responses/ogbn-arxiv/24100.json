The paper proposes a novel decentralized algorithm that combines local feedback and information exchanged through backhauls to produce minimum mean square error (MMSE)-optimal global channel estimates at each device. This problem is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
