The authors also optimize their approach for deployment on an embedded FPGA, which could fall under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV), embedded systems (cs.EM), and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the authors mention using high-level synthesis (HLS) for porting their algorithms, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
