The paper proposes two auxiliary regularization terms to address the issues of repeated translations and incomplete translations in NAT models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related areas. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as regularization, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper leverages the dual nature of translation tasks, which involves bidirectional processing, indicating that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper conducts experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as it involves evaluating the performance of a machine learning model on a dataset."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
