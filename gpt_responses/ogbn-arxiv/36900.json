It also involves adding noise to the gradients, which is a common technique in cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the use of adaptive clipping is a technique commonly used in data science (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves theoretical analysis of the algorithm, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
