The paper also discusses the use of Renyi entropy, which is a concept commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.DS) as it deals with communication between multiple terminals. Finally, the paper's focus on generating common randomness may also be relevant to the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
