The paper also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, which is a common practice in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks (cs.IR). The generated data could be useful for improving the performance of handwritten word spotting and recognition tasks, which are also part of the subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL).
