The proposed method involves using a synthetic people stereo patch dataset to learn wide baseline dense stereo matching for people. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of a neural network to learn human-specific features, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a stereo constraint to solve wide baseline stereo reconstruction of humans, which suggests that it may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
