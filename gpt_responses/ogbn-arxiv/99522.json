The paper also uses a bipartite network model to analyze the coverage achieved by the information dissemination algorithm. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper focuses on a specialized DTN system that comprises static message buffers or throwboxes kept in popular places besides the mobile agents hopping from one place to another. The paper also discusses the use of thresholded one-mode projection of bipartite networks to estimate information coverage. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the analysis of a specialized DTN system and proposes a closed-form equation to predict the amount of information coverage. The paper also discusses the use of evolving bipartite networks to explain the observed temporal invariance of information coverage over the DTN. \n4. cs.SD (Software Development) - The paper proposes a delay-tolerant information dissemination algorithm for a specialized DTN system and analyzes its coverage using a bipartite network model. The paper also discusses the use of thresholded one-mode projection of bipartite networks to estimate information coverage. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
