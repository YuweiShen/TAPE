This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of polynomial invariant theory suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and algebraic geometry (cs.AG). The study of shape enumerators and constructions of self-dual codes relates to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the application of ordered flip to the classification of bidimensional self-dual NRT-codes suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
