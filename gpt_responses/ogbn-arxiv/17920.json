The use of DL in EEG analysis also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it aims to improve the interpretation of EEG signals for various applications. Additionally, the paper discusses the reproducibility of experiments, which is a topic relevant to the field of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
