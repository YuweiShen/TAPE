The Sim-to-Real setting involves the use of simulators, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) research. The paper also discusses the use of a dynamic model, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
