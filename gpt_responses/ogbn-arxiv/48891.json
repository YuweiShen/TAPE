The use of multiple receivers and eavesdroppers makes it relevant to the sub-categories of multiple access channels (cs.MM) and network information theory (cs.NI). The study of the Gaussian MIMO channel model also makes it relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
