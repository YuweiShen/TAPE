The use of ADMM and message passing algorithms is also common in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the ability to parallelize the algorithm, which is a topic of interest in the field of distributed systems (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of cost functionals, which is a topic studied in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
