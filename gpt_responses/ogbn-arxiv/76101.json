The use of cross-validation and optimization techniques to choose the shrinkage coefficients is also a common approach in these fields. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Signal Processing). The paper also discusses applications in array signal processing, which suggests cs.ST (Statistics) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques for low-complexity solutions suggests cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
