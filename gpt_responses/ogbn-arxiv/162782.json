The proposed model involves exploring channel-wise correlation within an image and across images, which involves learning and modeling complex relationships between features. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments conducted involve publicly available benchmarks, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
