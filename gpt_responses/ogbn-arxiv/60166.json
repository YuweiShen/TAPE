The paper uses techniques from hashing, probability theory, and data structures, which are all core topics in computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). \n\nHowever, the paper also discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications, which suggests that these sub-categories are also relevant. Additionally, the paper uses ideas from information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) to analyze the performance of the proposed data structure. Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
