It also involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which could place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which could place it in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
