This involves designing a step adapter to adjust the planned trajectories and achieve push recovery. The approach is validated with simulations of a torque-controlled humanoid robot. Given the focus on robotics and control, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves system-level considerations and optimization, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the use of simulations and machine learning techniques could suggest categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of optimization techniques and the focus on planning could suggest a category such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
