This involves decoding visually-evoked EEG brain signal streams and using a unified training framework that combines multi-class Common Spatial Pattern and deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The system also uses a Dynamical Graph Representation of EEG signals to capture the structured spatial correlations of EEG channels in an adaptive manner. The paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories, as it involves developing a BCI system that uses deep learning techniques to process EEG signals and generate 3D objects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
