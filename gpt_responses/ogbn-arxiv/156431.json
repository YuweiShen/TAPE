The use of signature encoding and LZ77 factorization also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and data compression (cs.CC). The paper also presents efficient construction algorithms for straight-line programs, which are commonly used in grammar-based compression, indicating a possible connection to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper discusses applications of the data structures in natural language processing and bioinformatics, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
