Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also involves signal processing and information theory aspects, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The proposed measurement system and centralized controller also involve system-level design and control, which could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
