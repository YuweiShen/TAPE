It may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) categories, as these topics are closely related to deep learning. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) category, as it discusses efficient deployment of neural network architectures to fit different hardware constraints."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
