This involves converting an RDDL instance into a ground DBN, extracting a graph structure from the DBN, and training a neural model that computes an embedding for each node in the graph and scores each ground action. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a neural approach for solving RMDPs, which is a subfield of AI that deals with decision-making under uncertainty. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a neural model to compute embeddings and scores for nodes and actions, respectively, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): RMDPs are often used in robotics to model complex decision-making problems, and the paper's approach could have applications in this field. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): RMDPs are also used in systems and control theory to model stochastic systems, and the paper's approach could have implications in this area. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): RDDL is a probabilistic planning language used to express RMDPs, and the paper's approach involves converting an RDDL instance into a ground DBN, which could be of interest to researchers in programming"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
