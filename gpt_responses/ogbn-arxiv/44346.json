Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel network architecture and recurrent neural network-based approach for pancreas segmentation, which involves designing a domain-specific network and contextual learning. Hence, it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
