The paper also discusses the complexity of finding equilibria in these games, which is a common topic in game theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is motivated by P2P and web caching applications, which are networking and internet architecture topics. The paper also discusses the network structure and its impact on the complexity of finding equilibria in CC games. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of erasure codes in content distribution, which is a distributed computing topic. The paper also discusses the impact of network structure on the complexity of finding equilibria in CC games, which is relevant to distributed computing. \n\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of erasure codes in content distribution, which is a topic in information theory. The paper also discusses the impact of network structure on the complexity of finding equilibria in CC games, which is relevant to information theory. \n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the impact of network structure on the complexity of finding equilibria in CC games, which is a topic in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
