The paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detector for detecting attacks on DNN classifiers at test time, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and security research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CR, and cs.CV, followed by cs.AI and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
