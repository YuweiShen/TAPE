This involves creating a probabilistic elevation map of the terrain using a learning-based scene range estimator as a sensor, considering uncertainty in estimated scene range and robot pose as the AUV moves through the environment. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Graphics (cs.GR), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
