The use of regular languages and projection functions suggests a connection to formal language theory (cs.FL) and programming languages (cs.PL). The concept of partial observability and downgrading events relates to the area of logic and verification (cs.LO). Finally, the paper also discusses the relevance of the results to non-interference, which is a well-known concept in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
