The proposed method uses graph neural networks to model the compatibility of clothing items, which is a common technique in computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to learn outfit compatibility. The proposed method uses node-wise graph neural networks to model the complex relations among clothing items in an outfit.\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with fashion recommendation, which involves analyzing textual features of clothing items. The proposed method can be used to model outfit compatibility from textual modality as well.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach to learn outfit compatibility. The proposed method uses graph neural networks to model the complex relations among clothing items in an outfit and an attention mechanism to calculate the outfit compatibility score.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with fashion recommendation, which involves analyzing both visual and textual features of clothing items. The proposed method can be used to model outfit compatibility from multiple modalities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
