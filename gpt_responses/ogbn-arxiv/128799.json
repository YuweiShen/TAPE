The study involves analyzing typing data from participants and examining the efficiency of different strategies of use. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of immersive head-mounted displays, which suggests that it could also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) and Virtual Reality (cs.VR) sub-categories.
