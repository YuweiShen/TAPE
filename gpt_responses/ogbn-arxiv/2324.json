However, the focus on Web data and extraction systems suggests that the paper is more likely to belong to the sub-categories of databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of machine learning techniques to distinguish correct and erroneous data also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the mention of correlation modeling and truth finding suggests a connection to data mining (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
