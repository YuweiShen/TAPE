The proposed method uses a shallow neural network classifier, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sensors and algorithms, which could potentially fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) if they involve privacy or security concerns."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
