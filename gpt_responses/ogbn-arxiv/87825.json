The paper also discusses the use of diversity constraints, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithms used in the paper involve computational complexity and optimization, which are topics in computer science theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of different voting rules, which is a topic in social choice theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
