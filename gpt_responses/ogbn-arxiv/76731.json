This work involves computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR) techniques for establishing a 1-1 correspondence between tooth surfaces and building a tooth classification scheme. The use of statistical shape analysis also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) methods.
