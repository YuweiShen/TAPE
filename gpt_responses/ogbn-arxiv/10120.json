The paper specifically focuses on learning linear separators and provides algorithms for both malicious noise and adversarial label noise models. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
