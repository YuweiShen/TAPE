The paper also discusses training and optimization techniques for neural networks, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a lightweight module that is not affected by spatial resolution suggests that the paper may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
