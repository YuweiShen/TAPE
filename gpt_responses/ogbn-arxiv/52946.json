The paper specifically focuses on handling noisy lexical constraints in machine translation, which is a problem related to language modeling and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also proposes a novel framework that treats constraints as external memories, which involves the use of neural networks and memory-based models. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deal with the development and application of intelligent systems and learning algorithms. \n\nFurthermore, the paper involves experiments and evaluations of the proposed approach, which may involve statistical analysis and optimization techniques. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deal with the development and application of neural networks and optimization algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
