The use of mixed integer programming and heuristic search algorithms suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.OR (Operations Research), or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The focus on feasibility constraints and the use of constraint programming suggest that cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques and the emphasis on performance evaluation suggest that cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
