The use of regularized kernel machines as a case study suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of statistical learning theory (cs.ST). However, since the paper does not explicitly mention statistical learning theory, we have ranked it lower in our list."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
