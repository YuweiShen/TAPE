This involves violating DRAM access timing parameters to induce read errors that exhibit true random behavior. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computer security (cs.CR), architecture (cs.AR), information theory (cs.IT), software engineering (cs.SE), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
