The algorithm presented in the paper involves altering the shape of edges, which could be seen as a data structure problem (cs.DS). The experimental evaluation involves measuring the total edge length and drawing area, which could be seen as a discrete mathematics problem (cs.DM). Finally, the use of additional bends in the edges could be seen as a trade-off between geometric results and complexity, which could be seen as a problem in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
