Therefore, cs.COMM and cs.IT are the most likely categories. The paper also involves the design and optimization of phased arrays, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). The paper proposes an iterative training scheme, which involves the use of algorithms and optimization techniques (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the joint training of transmitting and receiving antenna arrays, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
