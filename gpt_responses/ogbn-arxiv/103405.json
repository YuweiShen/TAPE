The paper also discusses the use of entropy functions, which is a common tool in Information Theory and Probability (cs.ITP). The paper's focus on characterising correlation among sources suggests that it may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Science (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's emphasis on characterising dependencies among sources suggests that it may also be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
