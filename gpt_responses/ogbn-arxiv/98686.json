The approach proposed in the paper is based on solving inverse problems related to motion blur, which is a characteristic of moving objects in videos. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with sports videos, which often involve complex trajectories, suggesting that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of a high-speed camera, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The proposed approach involves fitting a piecewise quadratic curve to model trajectories, which suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for object tracking, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
