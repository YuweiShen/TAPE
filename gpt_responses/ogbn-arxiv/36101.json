Additionally, the paper provides a proof of convergence in expectation and experiments on benchmark domains, which are common practices in machine learning research. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories as it discusses the application of TD methods in decision-making and control problems. The data structures (cs.DS) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses the storage requirements of different TD methods. Finally, the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category may be relevant as TD methods are commonly used in reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning that often involves neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
