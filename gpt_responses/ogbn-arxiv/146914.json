The algorithm involves selecting atomic blocks and dynamically selecting them during training, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of FLOPS configurations, which suggests that it may belong to the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category.
