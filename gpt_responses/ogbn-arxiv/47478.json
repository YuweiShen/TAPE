The method is based on weakly supervised learning, which involves training models without fully annotated datasets, and this is a popular research area in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of a student-teacher framework, which is a common approach in deep learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve the use of videos and artificially generated data, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
