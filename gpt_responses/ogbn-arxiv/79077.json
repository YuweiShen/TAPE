The concept of secrecy is also related to cryptography (cs.CR), and the use of public communication channels is a common theme in communication theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the need for secrecy in the presence of eavesdroppers, which is a topic in security and privacy (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical models and bounds, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM) and other areas of computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
