It specifically focuses on exploratory search, which is often supported by information visualization. However, the paper argues that such approaches cannot be directly translated to conversational search. Instead, the paper proposes using interactive storytelling as a tool to enable exploratory search within the framework of a conversational interface. This involves coupling interactive storytelling with a dialogue-based system that provides verbal explanations and responsive design. Given this focus on human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and information retrieval, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Computation and Language (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
