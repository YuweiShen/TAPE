This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the category of Computer Security and Cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a low-overhead solution that requires minimal source code changes and works across multiple languages/platforms, indicating that it may also belong to the categories of Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions that the proposed solution is architecture-specific, which suggests that it may belong to the category of Computer Architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the paper discusses the experimental results of applying the proposed solution to protect several programs, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
