The paper also discusses the use of high-resolution channel estimation, which falls under signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas is a key aspect of the paper, making it relevant to the sub-category of massive MIMO (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of channel extrapolation, which is a topic related to communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
