The use of random ensembles and the analysis of outage probability suggest that the paper may also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and closed-loop multicast suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
