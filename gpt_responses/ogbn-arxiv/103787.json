This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning models for change detection also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of diverse noises, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of end-to-end training suggests the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
