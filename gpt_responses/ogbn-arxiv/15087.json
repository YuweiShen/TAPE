The focus is on building robust predictions without prior knowledge about data, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for solving Symbolic Regression problem using a hybrid approach that combines Genetic Programming and Relevance Vector Machine. This falls under the scope of Artificial Intelligence as it involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines Genetic Programming and Relevance Vector Machine for Symbolic Regression problem. This falls under the scope of Neural and Evolutionary Computing as it involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and evolve over time. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for building robust predictions without prior knowledge about data. This falls under the scope of Systems and Control as it involves developing algorithms that can control and optimize complex systems. \n5. cs.DM (Data Mining): The paper proposes a method for solving Symbolic Regression problem using a hybrid approach that combines Genetic Programming and Relevance Vector Machine. This falls under the scope of Data Mining as it involves developing algorithms that can extract useful information from large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
