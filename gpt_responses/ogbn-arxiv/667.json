The paper also uses image datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), which suggests that it may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the learning process of deep neural networks, which is a common topic in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. As the paper deals with the issue of label noise, it may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category, as label noise can be introduced maliciously to deceive classifiers. Finally, the paper proposes a modification to the gradient descent algorithm, which is a common optimization method in the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
