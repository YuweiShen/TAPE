It also involves graphics applications such as character generation and animation, which could fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The use of autoencoders suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper involves mesh sampling operations, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of a multivariate Gaussian distribution suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
