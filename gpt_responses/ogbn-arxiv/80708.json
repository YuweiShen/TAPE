The model draws inspiration from cognitive psychology models of human attention and event perception, and uses Grenander's pattern theory formalism to represent spatial-temporal features. The paper involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for analyzing egocentric videos, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for developing an unsupervised computational model, and machine learning (cs.LG) for predicting gaze fixation points and temporally segmenting videos. The paper also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it deals with understanding human attention and perception, and neural networks (cs.NE) as the proposed model uses energy-based surprise modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
