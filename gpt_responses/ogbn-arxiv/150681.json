The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a common technique in AI, and the paper specifically focuses on explaining the outputs of DNNs. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the training process of DNNs, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the experiments involve image classification (cs.CV) and the generation of adversarial examples (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
