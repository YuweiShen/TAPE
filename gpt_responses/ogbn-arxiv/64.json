The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian processes (GP) for learning and identifying reliable annotations, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep features, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the method, which is a common concern in information retrieval (cs.IR) and large-scale data analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
