The use of SVD for dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for efficiently computing SVD for a given time range query, which could be of interest to researchers in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
