The paper also mentions simulation results, which suggests that the paper may fall under the category of networked and distributed systems (cs.NI) or signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper presents a construction method for the codes, which could also place it under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
