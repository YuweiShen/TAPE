The paper also discusses the problem on restricted graph classes such as $(r,\\ell)$-graphs and split graphs. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper involves graph theory and combinatorics, which makes cs.GT (Graph Theory) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the size of kernels, which is a topic in computational geometry, making cs.CG (Computational Geometry) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
