The use of global and local models suggests a machine learning approach, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of graph traversal methods also suggests a focus on graph-based algorithms, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of semi-supervised learning techniques suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
