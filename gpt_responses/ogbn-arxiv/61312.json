The paper focuses on the sub-packetization level of these codes, which is a parameter that determines the granularity of the data that can be accessed during repair. This is a topic that is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as well as distributed systems (cs.DS), networking (cs.NI), and parallel computing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the construction of codes using algorithms, which is a topic that falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
