This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with sub-Nyquist sampling, which is a signal processing technique used to reduce the sampling rate of signals. The paper also discusses the use of low-pass filters, which are commonly used in signal processing.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the transmission of information over analog channels, which is a key aspect of multimedia communication.\n4. cs.SP (Speech Processing) - The paper deals with sub-Nyquist sampling, which is a technique commonly used in speech processing to reduce the sampling rate of speech signals.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the use of randomized sampling methods, which are commonly used in machine learning for efficient data acquisition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
