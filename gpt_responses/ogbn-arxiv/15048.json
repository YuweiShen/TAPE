The proposed system also involves network infrastructure, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under the category of cs.DL (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
