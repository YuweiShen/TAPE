The use of lattice-reduction-aided decoding and naive lattice decoding suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The mention of V-BLAST transmission and multiple-access systems may indicate a focus on Communication and Networking (cs.CE). Finally, the use of MIMO technology suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
