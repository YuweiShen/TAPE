The use of Taylor expansions and Chi-type distances suggests a focus on mathematical and analytical methods, which could also place the paper in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or data structures (cs.DS) categories. Finally, the application of the formula to specific families of distributions could be of interest to the statistics community, making the paper relevant to the statistics (cs.ST) category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
