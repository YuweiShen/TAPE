This involves dynamic analysis of app UI state transition graphs and runtime network traffics, which can be considered as software engineering tasks. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper leverages heuristic-based rules to identify ad fraudulent behaviours, which can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves building UI state transition graphs and collecting runtime network traffics, which can be considered as data structures and algorithms tasks. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves detecting ad frauds in mobile apps that display multimedia content such as ads, which can be considered as a multimedia-related task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
