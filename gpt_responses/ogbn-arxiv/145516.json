This falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.STAT). The paper also discusses the use of estimators that either use or do not use group membership information, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the validation of the results on real-world datasets indicates that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.ML)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
