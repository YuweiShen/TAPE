The paper uses random walks on the vertices of a graph to generate multiscale relationships, which can then be used to learn a series of latent representations. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including social networks (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), and statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
