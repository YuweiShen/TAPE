Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also involves graphics and rendering, which falls under cs.GR (Computer Graphics). The use of neural networks and regularization techniques suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as possible categories. Finally, the real-time aspect of the proposed method may also place it under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
