The paper proposes a new operator that generalizes the classic $1$NN and skyline queries, which are important operators in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DS). The paper also proposes algorithms for processing the eclipse queries, which involves computational complexity and optimization, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
