Therefore, cs.SD (Sound) and cs.SI (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes new training losses based on musical theory, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of the reduction of the alphabet before or after training of the model, which is related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
