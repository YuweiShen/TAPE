The paper also mentions the region decomposition method and decentralized coding method, which are commonly used in Distributed Computing (cs.DC) and Computer Communications (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves mathematical proofs and algorithms, which are relevant to the Symbolic Computation (cs.SC) sub-category.
