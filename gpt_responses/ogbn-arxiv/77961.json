The paper also discusses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which are a type of data structure (cs.DS). The optimization of multiple criteria in graph drawing also involves the use of algorithms and computational methods (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the minimum crossing angle, which is a common metric in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper discusses the readability of graph drawings, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
