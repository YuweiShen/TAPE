This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses a new model for ranking and introduces a nonparametric clustering algorithm. Both of these topics are relevant to artificial intelligence.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with ranking and clustering, which are topics that fall under the domain of discrete mathematics.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses a new model for ranking and describes procedures for estimating it from data.
