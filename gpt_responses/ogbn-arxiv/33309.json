The use of noisy or erroneous oracles is a common theme in information theory (cs.IT) and the study of algorithms that can handle such noise is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents approximation algorithms, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
