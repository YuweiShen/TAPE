Specifically, the paper focuses on improving the performance of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is commonly used in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method in control systems (cs.SY) and uses tabular data structures (cs.DS), which further support these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
