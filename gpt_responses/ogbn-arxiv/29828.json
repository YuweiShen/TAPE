It also uses recent findings in string attractors and grammars based on locally-consistent parsing, which are relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Information theory (cs.IT) is also relevant as the paper discusses compressibility measures for highly repetitive texts. Machine learning (cs.LG) and distributed computing (cs.DC) are less likely but still possible sub-categories as the paper mentions the use of polylogarithmic time and space, which are relevant to these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
