Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on natural language processing and computational linguistics. The use of the BM25 scoring method and word embeddings also suggests a focus on information retrieval, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning classifiers, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the use of legal texts and the focus on legal domain suggests a possible connection to cs.CY (Computers and Society), which deals with the social and ethical implications of computing technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
