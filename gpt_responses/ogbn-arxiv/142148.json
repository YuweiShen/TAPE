This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses different download strategies for collecting web images, which involves information retrieval techniques. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with images collected from the web, which is a form of multimedia. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, for the classification task. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): Although not the primary focus, the paper may touch upon natural language processing techniques for querying search engines to collect web images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
