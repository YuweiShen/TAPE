The use of recurrent units and spatial-temporal integration also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of multi-level training objectives and the focus on improving feature representation suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category as it deals with the problem of false activation and missing activation, which are security concerns in video surveillance systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
