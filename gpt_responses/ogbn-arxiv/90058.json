The paper also proposes a new training procedure for zero-shot learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a trainable 3D CNN also suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the benchmarking paradigm for video classification, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
