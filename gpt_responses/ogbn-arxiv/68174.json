These techniques are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the use of a caching mechanism and the Hoeffding bound, which are statistical tools commonly used in the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
