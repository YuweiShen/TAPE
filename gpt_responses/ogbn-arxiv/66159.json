This topic is closely related to several areas of computer science, including discrete mathematics (cs.DM), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), computational complexity (cs.CC), and computational geometry (cs.CG). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
