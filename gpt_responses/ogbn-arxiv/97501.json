The problem is also related to planar graphs and chordless paths, which are topics in Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Graph Theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents an algorithmic result, which could place it in the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
