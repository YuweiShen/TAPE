Additionally, it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a novel hierarchical multi-task tagging model for joint extraction of entities and relations. It could also be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as knowledge graph construction is a common task in information retrieval. Finally, it may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the proposed model uses neural networks for learning semantic representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
