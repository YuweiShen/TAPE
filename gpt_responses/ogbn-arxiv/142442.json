The paper proposes a novel distributed algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement learning, which involves training a deep-Q network to maximize the objective function, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also involves game theoretic analysis of the system dynamics, which suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
