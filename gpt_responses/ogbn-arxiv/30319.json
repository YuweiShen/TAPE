The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised language model pretraining, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the models is based on their generalization capabilities, which is a common concern in NE and NLP in general. Therefore, cs.NE is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of contextualized embeddings in out-of-domain evaluation, which is a common topic in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
