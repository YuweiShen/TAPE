The approach emphasizes interpersonal distance and spatial communication to build a unified planner for a human-robot collaborative environment. The paper utilizes machine learning and optimization tools to modify the Robot Operating System (ROS) navigation stack. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) are also likely categories as they are mentioned in the paper as tools used in the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
