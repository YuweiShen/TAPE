The proposed architecture is also applicable in robotics (cs.RO) where agents need to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously. The use of signal suppression, known from the subsumption architecture, is also mentioned, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of high-level visual input, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed solution, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
