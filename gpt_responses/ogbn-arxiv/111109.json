This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of neural networks and machine learning techniques for this task suggests that it could also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The encoding of stroke structure information into graph node/edge representations suggests that it could also fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of natural language processing techniques for labeling suggests that it could also fall under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
