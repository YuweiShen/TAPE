The paper proposes a new algorithm called CHIME that is designed to efficiently detect subdimensional motifs of different lengths in large-scale multivariate time series. This problem is closely related to several subfields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
