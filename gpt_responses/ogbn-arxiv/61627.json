The paper proposes a new model-agnostic paradigm for interpreting these decisions, which involves defining a new type of saliency that satisfies specific conditions. This approach involves machine learning techniques and could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with medical imaging (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) since it involves detecting lesions from medical images and interpreting the decisions made by deep learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
