Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The use of word and character n-gram embeddings suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Learning), which deals with machine learning techniques. The paper also discusses the use of cosine similarity and self-induced error corpora, which suggests that it may belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural embeddings, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
