The paper also uses autoencoders to capture the properties of different classes of images, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a distributed learning approach using one-class classifiers and autoencoders, which is a machine learning technique. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the issue of privacy and security by proposing a filter that blocks third parties from uploading privacy-sensitive images. The paper also discusses the robustness of the proposed filter against attacks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the filtering of images on social media, which is a multimedia application. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed learning approach that takes place on edge devices, which is a distributed computing application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
