This problem is inherently related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY), as it involves selecting a subset of sensors to minimize estimation error while optimizing energy efficiency. The paper also proposes randomized algorithms based on Gibbs sampling, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the use of expectation-maximization for learning the joint statistics of the sensor data, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
