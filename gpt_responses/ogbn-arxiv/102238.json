The study includes a field survey of players and a geostatistical analysis, both of which involve the use of computational methods. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes the movement patterns of Pokemon GO players, which can be seen as a type of social network. The study also examines the game's impact on human mobility patterns, which is relevant to the study of information networks. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design implications of Pokemon GO's geographic biases, which could be seen as a software engineering problem. The study suggests ways in which future systems in this space could be designed to counteract these biases. \n- cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks): The paper examines the societal impact of Pokemon GO, specifically focusing on its geographic effects. The study analyzes how the game reinforces existing geographically-linked biases and how it may have instigated a large-scale shift in global human mobility patterns. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the design implications of Pokemon GO's geographic biases and safety risks. The study suggests ways in which future systems in this space could be designed to address these issues, which is relevant to the field of human-com"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
