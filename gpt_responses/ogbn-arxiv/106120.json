The use of partial observability and the advantage given to the evader suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the algorithmic approach and the use of value iteration suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
