The proposed approach also accounts for traffic rules and geometries, which suggests relevance to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses simulation results and computational complexity, which may relate to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
