The use of stochastic data arrival and asynchronous transmission also suggests a possible fit in the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also employs joint-typicality detection, which is a common technique in statistical inference (cs.SI). The use of codewords and transmission rates suggests a possible fit in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with optimization of transmission rates and probability of unsuccessful decoding, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
