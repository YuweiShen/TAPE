The paper also discusses the use of value functions and policies, which are key concepts in reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The paper applies the proposed approach to simulated robotic manipulation domains, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of mutual information among exogenous state variables, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
