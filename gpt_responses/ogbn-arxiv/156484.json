The paper focuses on the use of modular approaches to combine pre-trained modules with untrained modules, which is a technique that is commonly used in the field of deep learning. This paper is likely to be classified under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
