The use of neural networks and machine learning techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of classifiers to adversarial attacks, which suggests that it could belong to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category.
