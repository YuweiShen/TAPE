The paper also discusses the use of a DSL (domain-specific language) for expressing effectful programs. These topics are closely related to programming languages research, making cs.PL the most likely category. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions the functional-logic language Curry, which combines functional programming with logic programming. While the paper does not focus on logic programming, the discussion of Curry and non-determinism suggests a connection to cs.LO. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the implementation and evolution of a DSL, which are topics relevant to software engineering. The paper also mentions the use of the DSL for code generation and abstract interpretation, which are techniques used in software engineering. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the use of a DSL for expressing effectful programs, which can be seen as a formal language. The paper also mentions the use of non-standard interpretations of the DSL, such as code generation and abstract interpretation, which are related to automata theory. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): While the paper does not focus on natural language processing, the discussion of DSLs and the use of non-standard interpretations could be"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
