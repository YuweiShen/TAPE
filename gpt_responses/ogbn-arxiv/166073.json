The paper also presents online learning methods for predicting content popularity, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The use of Grassmannian prediction model (GPM) and constrained non-negative least squares (NNLS) algorithm also suggests a possible connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the simulation results involve the use of MovieLens dataset, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
