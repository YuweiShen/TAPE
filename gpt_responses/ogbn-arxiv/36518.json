Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of a multi-criteria decision making algorithm, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves language processing, which could fall under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of proportional impact weights is a statistical technique, which could fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves searching for relevant captions, which could fall under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
