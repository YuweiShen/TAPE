The primary radar is a surveillance radar, which falls under the category of networked sensing and control systems (cs.NI) and system and control theory (cs.SY). The secondary Wi-Fi networks involve communication and information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as the interference from unlicensed devices to a primary receiver must be within acceptable bounds. The paper also analyzes the impact of radar transmissions on achievable WLAN throughput, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
