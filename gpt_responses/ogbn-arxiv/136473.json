The use of complex exponentials and modulations with unknown waveforms suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The application of the problem to single-molecule imaging and radar imaging suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of Imaging and Computer Vision (cs.SI) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
