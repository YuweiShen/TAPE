It also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it pertains to image classification. The paper also discusses the security aspect of the classifiers (cs.CR) and the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in generating certificates. Finally, the paper proposes a new attack method that involves neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
