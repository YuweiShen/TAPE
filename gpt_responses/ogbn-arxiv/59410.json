The use of tile-based models and their transformations also suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as possible sub-categories. The paper also involves computational geometry and simulations, which could fall under cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
