The paper also discusses the construction of a cryptographic invariant map, which is a new primitive in cryptography and could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves mathematical algorithms and computations, which could be relevant to researchers in discrete mathematics (cs.DS).
