The paper discusses the challenges of low-bit quantization and proposes a solution that involves differentiable soft quantization. This method is evaluated on several popular network structures and includes an implementation for deployment on resource-limited devices. Based on this information, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
