Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the link budget metrics and communication rate probabilities, which are related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. The use of millimeter wave techniques and the characterization of fundamental link budget metrics suggest that cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a possible category. The paper also considers the impact of blockages caused by heavy vehicles, which is related to system engineering, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the SINR outage probability, which is related to security and cryptography, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
