It focuses on end-to-end learning, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and falls under the category of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also deals with signal processing and wireless communication, which are related to the sub-categories cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The methodology used in the paper involves designing and implementing wireless signal classifiers, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of choosing the right data representation for different spectrum monitoring tasks, which is related to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
