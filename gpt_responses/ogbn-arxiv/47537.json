Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses gradient boosting classifiers and document embedding methods, which are common in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the need for broader context in metaphor processing, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to improve metaphor identification, which could also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
