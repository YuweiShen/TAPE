Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. The paper also focuses on MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems, which involve the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends. This suggests that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) could also be a likely sub-category, as it deals with the design and analysis of communication networks. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm that leverages the sparseness of the mmWave channel, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper analyzes the performance of the proposed algorithm, which could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
