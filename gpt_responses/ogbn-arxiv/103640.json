The paper also discusses the VC-dimension and primal shatter dimension, which are concepts in computational learning theory (cs.LG) and combinatorics (cs.DM). The analysis of the algorithms involves complexity analysis and tradeoffs, which are topics in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA).
