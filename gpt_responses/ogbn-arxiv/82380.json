The use of a low-complexity technique for frequency synchronization also suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA) or signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the study of energy and spectral efficiency in massive MIMO systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
