The problem is also relevant to program synthesis (cs.PL), which is mentioned in the abstract. The algorithm's efficiency is related to the structure of the input functions, which suggests that it may involve data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
