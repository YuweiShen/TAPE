The proposed method involves clustering and labeling mid-level representations, which is a technique often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its method on two popular datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
