The use of optimization and machine learning algorithms also suggests a possible fit with machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves the estimation of normals, which is a common task in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
