The use of a database of cases suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and possibly also to computational engineering (cs.CE). The potential applications listed in the abstract, such as automated scientific discovery and probabilistic expert systems, suggest a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
