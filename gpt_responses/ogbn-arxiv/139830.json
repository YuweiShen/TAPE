This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely sub-category. \n\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of predictive models to identify the best loans for investment in the P2P lending market. This involves retrieving relevant information from past loan data to make informed investment decisions, which falls under the domain of information retrieval. \n\n3. cs.CE (Computational Economics): The paper proposes a scoring approach to help lenders decide their fund allocations in the P2P lending market. This involves computational methods to optimize investment decisions, making cs.CE a likely sub-category. \n\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography or security, but the P2P lending market involves financial transactions and data privacy concerns. Therefore, cs.CR is a possible sub-category. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a two-stage scoring approach using wide and deep learning to build predictive models for credit scoring and profit scoring in the P2P lending market.
