The use of sphere decoding algorithms and complexity analysis suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions comparisons with classic sphere decoding, which could indicate a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) or computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
