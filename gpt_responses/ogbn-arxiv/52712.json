The use of blocks of cells and the need to minimize erasing operations suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also presents an efficient construction, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of algorithms and complexity (cs.SI). Finally, the use of codes for storage and retrieval of data is a topic that could be relevant to researchers in the area of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
