The authors propose a framework for learning probabilistic context-free grammars for protein sequences using structural information to constrain the syntactic trees. This involves implementing maximum-likelihood and contrastive estimators of parameters for simple yet practical grammars. This work involves machine learning techniques and is likely to be categorized under cs.LG. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of structural information to constrain the syntactic trees for learning probabilistic context-free grammars for protein sequences. This involves the use of computational predictions and wet experiments to obtain amino acid contacts. The use of AI techniques to analyze and interpret this data is likely to result in the paper being categorized under cs.AI. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper discusses the challenge of learning the language of protein sequences, which requires at least context-free grammars. The authors propose a framework for learning probabilistic context-free grammars for protein sequences using structural information to constrain the syntactic trees. This work involves computational linguistics techniques and is likely to be categorized under cs.CL. \n4. q-bio.BM (Biomolecules): The paper discusses the challenge of learning the language of protein sequences, which requires at"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
