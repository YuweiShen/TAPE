The paper introduces a visual reasoning corpus and discusses the training of machine learning systems, which are topics typically associated with computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC).
