It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a more efficient search strategy for finding effective augmentation policies. Additionally, it involves the use of neural networks, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves optimization techniques, which may place it under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
