This falls under the domain of information theory and signal processing, which are covered by the arXiv categories cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.SP (Speech Processing). The paper also discusses connections between undersampled channel capacity and multiple-input multiple-output channels, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper highlights connections between undersampled channel capacity and minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimation from sampled data, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
