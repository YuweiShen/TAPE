The proposed neural network architectures involve learning similarity between the two modalities, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses neighborhood sampling and similarity scores, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
