The paper also proposes a meta-learning approach for adapting the model to new tasks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of facial expression recognition to cognitive states, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper uses benchmark datasets for facial AU detection, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
