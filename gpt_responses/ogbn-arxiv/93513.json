It also uses observable dynamics of the environment instead of an explicit reward function in MAML's finetune step. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with the adaptation of agents to new environments and changes in dynamics. The paper may also be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as efficient adaptation is critical for robots to operate in the real world. The paper may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category as it deals with the control of agents in dynamic environments. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it validates the method on common benchmark environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
