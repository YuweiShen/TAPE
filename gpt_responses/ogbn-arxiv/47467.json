This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep neural networks also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed method on publicly available databases indicates the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the focus on facial expressions and their recognition suggests the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
