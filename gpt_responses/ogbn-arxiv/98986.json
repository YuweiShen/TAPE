This is a core topic in programming languages research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of DSLs for more efficient and higher quality software development, which is a key concern in software engineering.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While not a primary focus of the paper, the use of DSLs for machine learning applications is mentioned as a potential use case.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to cs.LG, the use of DSLs for AI applications is briefly mentioned.\n- cs.SD (Software Development): The paper's focus on DSLs and their role in software development makes this category a likely fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
