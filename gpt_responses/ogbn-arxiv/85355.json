Additionally, the paper explores the similarities between biological and artificial neural networks, which could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The use of ablation as a technique for analyzing neural networks could also suggest the paper belongs to the cs.LG (Learning) category. The paper's focus on analyzing neural networks in the context of robotics could place it in the cs.RO (Robotics) category. Finally, the mention of weights in the network suggests a possible connection to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
