The paper also uses a pre-trained deep neural network model, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with natural language processing, as it uses Word2Vec embeddings of class labels (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses graph theory to regularize the estimates of manifolds, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
