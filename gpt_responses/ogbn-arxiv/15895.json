The use of equations to define codes suggests a possible connection to the Distributed Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The study of upper and lower bounds on code size is a common topic in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the problem of detecting errors may be related to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
