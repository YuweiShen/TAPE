The use of power indices and the study of their complexity also suggests a connection to algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The application of the results to resolve other problems in weighted voting games suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of probabilistic polynomial time and #P-completeness suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
