The paper also discusses an efficient distributed implementation of the method. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
