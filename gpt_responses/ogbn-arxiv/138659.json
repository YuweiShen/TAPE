The use of regenerating codes to minimize repair bandwidth and storage overhead is a key focus of the paper, which suggests that cs.IT (Information Theory) is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the practical aspects of implementing such codes, which suggests that cs.DS (Distributed Systems) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are also relevant sub-categories. The use of subspace-based approaches and low-complexity constructions suggests that cs.SI (Systems and Control) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
