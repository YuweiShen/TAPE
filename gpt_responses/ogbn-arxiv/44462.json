Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep neural networks for learning-based approaches, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with outdoor scenes, which could suggest it belongs to cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
