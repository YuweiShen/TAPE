The use of trajectory data suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB), while the focus on spatial and temporal aspects of the data suggests a connection to graphics (cs.GR) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The development of algorithms for trajectory simplification suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
