The proposed scheme involves the use of polar codes, random spreading, and minimum-mean squared error (MMSE) estimation. These techniques are commonly used in the field of information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also involves the use of detection algorithms and iterative decoding, which are relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
