The proofs rely on the structural properties of dominance relations, which can be analyzed using tools from abstract reduction systems (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of mixed strategies, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and proofs, which can be related to topics in logic and discrete mathematics (cs.LO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
