The paper also uses matroid theory to study the performance limits of deterministic linear network coding, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the existence of perfect solutions and develops a heuristic algorithm, which can be categorized under computational complexity (cs.CC) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
