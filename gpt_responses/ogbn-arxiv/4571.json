However, the paper also uses tools from information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and control systems (cs.SY) to analyze the convergence and lower bounds of the algorithm. Therefore, these categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
