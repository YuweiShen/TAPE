CBIR is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) that involves searching for images based on their content. The use of autoencoders for feature extraction is a popular technique in image retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The paper also discusses the compression of images, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
