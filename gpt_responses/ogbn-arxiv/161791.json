This falls under the scope of natural language processing, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses machine learning algorithms and their optimization to model statistical properties of training data. The paper also proposes an algorithm to reduce gender stereotypes in word embeddings. This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is a subfield of CS.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with machine learning algorithms and their application to natural language processing. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, which is a subfield of CS.AI.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the unintended consequences of using word embeddings that contain gender stereotypes and the potential harm it can cause. This falls under the scope of computers and society, which is a subfield of CS.CY.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the impact of gender stereotypes in word embeddings on social networks and the broader society.
