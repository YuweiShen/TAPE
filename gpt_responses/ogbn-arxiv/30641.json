The paper proposes a new concept of nonlinear CS based on composite mappings and provides a pointwise linearization method. The paper involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which are typical of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses image processing (cs.CV) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) in the context of nonlinear CS. Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm framework, which can be considered as a system and control theory (cs.SI) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
