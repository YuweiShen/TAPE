The use of a knowledge graph to transfer information between categories suggests a potential overlap with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL), as knowledge graphs are commonly used in these fields. Finally, the experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset suggest a potential overlap with information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
