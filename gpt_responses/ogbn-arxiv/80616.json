The proposed method involves improving the coordinate representation, which is a fundamental aspect of machine learning models (cs.LG). The authors also propose a more principled decoding method, which involves making decisions based on probability distributions, indicating a focus on probabilistic modeling and inference (cs.AI). The experiments involve evaluating the proposed method on two common benchmarks, indicating a focus on evaluation and comparison of machine learning models (cs.MM). Finally, the task of human pose estimation is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
