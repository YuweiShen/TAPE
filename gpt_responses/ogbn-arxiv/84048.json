Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), which deals with image and video analysis. The paper also involves machine learning techniques for designing efficient networks, which makes it relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques for reducing computational costs, which makes it relevant to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves the design of custom modules for deep neural networks, which makes it relevant to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
