The use of natural language to communicate preferences suggests a potential overlap with natural language processing (cs.CL). The learning of ranking functions and iterative updates to relevance functions suggest a potential overlap with machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of the technique to people, products, and scenes suggests a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
