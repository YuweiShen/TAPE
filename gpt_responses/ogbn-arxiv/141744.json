Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses the reduction of floating-point operations, which suggests that it could be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The proposed method is applicable to both lattices and finite constellations, which could make it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper includes simulations, which could make it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
