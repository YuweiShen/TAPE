The lenses are used for the analysis of 3D sonar data, which involves graphics and visualization techniques (cs.GR, cs.GRAPHICS). The lenses are also manipulated and parameterized depending on the task, which suggests the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the lenses are designed for use in immersive environments, which suggests the use of virtual reality techniques (cs.VR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
