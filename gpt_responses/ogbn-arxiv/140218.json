The paper also discusses the use of ReLU activation functions (cs.CV) and convex optimization techniques (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper's focus on analyzing the structure of hidden layers in deep neural networks could also fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
