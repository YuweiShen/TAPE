It also involves encoding and decoding of correlated sources, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of inner and outer bounds to characterize achievable rate regions is a common technique in information theory and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the reconstruction of a function of X and Y, which is a problem in networked information systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
