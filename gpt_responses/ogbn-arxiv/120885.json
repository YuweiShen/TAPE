The paper discusses the challenges of hyperparameter tuning and presents an automated parallel derivative-free optimization framework called Autotune. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This is the most likely category as the paper is about hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This category is also likely as hyperparameter tuning is a common problem in the field of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This category is likely as hyperparameter tuning is important for computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This category is likely as hyperparameter tuning is important for neural network models.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This category is also likely as the paper discusses the efficient distributed and parallel paradigms for training and tuning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
