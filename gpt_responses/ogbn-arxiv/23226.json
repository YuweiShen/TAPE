The paper also discusses the challenges of increasing the depth of CNNs, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep supervision and residual learning to address convergence and overfitting issues is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the testing and comparison of the proposed models with other state-of-the-art networks involves performance evaluation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
