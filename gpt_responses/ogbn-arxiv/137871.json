The system uses multi-stream convolutional networks, which are a popular deep learning architecture for image classification tasks, and therefore the paper is likely to be classified under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the advantage of processing nodules at multiple scales, which could be relevant to the medical imaging (cs.MS) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to automatic nodule management in lung cancer screening, which could be of interest to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
