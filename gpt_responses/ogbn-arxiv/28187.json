This involves the security and reliability of computer systems (cs.CR), as well as the design and analysis of algorithms and systems for computer hardware (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the Rowhammer PUF in device identification and key storage, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC), software engineering (cs.SE), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
