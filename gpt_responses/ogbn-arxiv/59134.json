The use of multi-task learning is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of statistical Extreme Value Theory, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep neural networks also falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with image classification, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
