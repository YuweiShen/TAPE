The paper also proposes a novel dataset augmentation framework using shape transformation, which involves the use of machine learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and environment adaptation, which are commonly studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the performance of pedestrian detection models, which is a topic of interest in the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the challenges of working with low-quality pedestrian datasets, which is related to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
