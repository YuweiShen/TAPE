The paper also involves combinatorial methods such as iterative algorithms and partitioning, which are often used in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the dimensions of linear codes with complementary duals (LCD codes), which are relevant to coding theory and computer science (cs.CC). The paper also proposes conjectures and discusses difficult problems, which are common in cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
