The paper focuses on learning a deep appearance map (DAM) from images or video frames, which can be used to synthesize appearance given new surface orientations and viewer positions. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also discusses how to map from an image or video frames to a DAM network to reproduce appearance, which involves learning-to-learn and optimization techniques, indicating that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions per-pixel segmentation, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.MM, in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
