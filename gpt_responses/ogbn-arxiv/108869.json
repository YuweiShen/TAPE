The paper proposes a control theoretical framework for distributed motion planning that takes into account both complex spatial and temporal specifications and communication quality. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MA, followed by cs.RO and cs.SY. The paper also involves the use of signal temporal logic (STL) and spatial-temporal logic (SpaTeL) formulas, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence and formal methods, respectively, hence cs.AI and cs.NI are also likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
