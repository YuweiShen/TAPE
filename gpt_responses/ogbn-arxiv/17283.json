This is related to distributed and parallel computing. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with multicast switches, which are used in social and information networks. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper presents an approach to network coding problems called the \"enhanced conflict graph\", which may have implications for computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
