Computer vision techniques are used to analyze the visual modality, making cs.CV a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a Select-Additive Learning (SAL) procedure to improve the generalizability of trained neural networks for multimodal sentiment analysis. This involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely sub-category. \n4. cs.SD (Sound) - The paper deals with acoustic modalities, which involve analyzing sound. This makes cs.SD a possible sub-category. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with multimodal sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing multiple modalities such as verbal, acoustic, and visual. This makes cs.MM a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
