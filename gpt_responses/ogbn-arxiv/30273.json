Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses pre-trained word embeddings and fine-tuning of a pre-trained BERT model, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with noisy data and uses a novel framework, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
