The paper also discusses contract theory and incentive mechanisms, which are related to game theory (cs.GT) and information theory (cs.IT). The optimization of the contract and the analysis of the feasibility of the proposed mechanism involve mathematical modeling and control theory, which are related to systems and control (cs.SY) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
