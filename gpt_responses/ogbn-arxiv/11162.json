The paper also uses information theory to prove its results, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The problem of finding a maximal fractional matching is related to network flows, which suggests that it could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category.
