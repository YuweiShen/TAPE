This involves encoding point-level information of each joint independently and assembling them into semantic representation in both spatial and temporal domains. The approach also integrates raw skeleton coordinates with a two-stream paradigm. Given these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with skeleton-based human action recognition, which is a subfield of computer vision. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an end-to-end convolutional co-occurrence feature learning framework, which involves learning features with a hierarchical methodology. This involves aggregating different levels of contextual information gradually, which is a machine learning task. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for action recognition and detection, which involves learning co-occurrence features from skeleton data. This is a task that falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with action recognition and detection from skeleton data, which is a multimedia task. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with skeleton-based human action recognition, which is a task that involves interaction between humans and computers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
