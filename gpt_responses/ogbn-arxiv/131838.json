The specific meta-heuristic search technique used is Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is a type of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of fitness functions, which are commonly used in control systems (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning to determine the weightings of fitness measures, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
