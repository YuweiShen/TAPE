The paper also discusses various optimization techniques, including semidefinite programming (cs.SD) and quadratic programming (cs.NA), which are relevant subfields of computer science. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on shape matching and image ordering, which are typical applications in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
