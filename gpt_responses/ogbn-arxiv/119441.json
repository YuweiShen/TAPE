The paper also establishes a connection between stack rearrangement and pebble motion problems, which is a useful abstraction in multi-robot path planning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithmic solution for stack rearrangement and informed search-based methods for finding high-quality solutions. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper establishes lower and upper bounds on optimality in terms of stack removals, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of robots in stack rearrangement problems. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes an algorithmic solution for stack rearrangement, which involves programming languages and their implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
