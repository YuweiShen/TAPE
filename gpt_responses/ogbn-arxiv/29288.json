The use of lambda-calculus and explicit substitutions also points towards the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses properties such as strong normalization and confluence, which are often studied in the context of programming language theory (cs.PL). The use of technology in named variable-style notation suggests a focus on theoretical computer science (cs.TL). The discussion of preservation of beta-strong normalization and normalisation of related calculi suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's title mentions \"safe and full composition,\" which could be related to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
