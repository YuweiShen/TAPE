The use of the term \"greedy\" suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves combinatorial aspects of graph theory, such as subdivisions and triangulations, which are relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the construction of drawings that are convex and angle-monotone suggests a connection to computational geometry and visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
