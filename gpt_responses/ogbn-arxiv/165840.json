This makes it likely to be classified under cs.MS.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Interval Pairwise Comparison Matrices are commonly used in decision-making problems, which are often studied in the field of AI. The paper proposes a unified approach to these matrices, which could be of interest to researchers in this field.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with pairwise comparison matrices, which are a common tool in discrete mathematics. The proposed framework involves consistency conditions and distance measures, which are also relevant to this field.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a framework for comparing different types of Interval Pairwise Comparison Matrices, which could be useful in machine learning applications where decision-making is involved.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Interval Pairwise Comparison Matrices are used in social network analysis to model preferences and relationships between individuals.
