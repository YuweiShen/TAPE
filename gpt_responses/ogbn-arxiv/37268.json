The paper proposes a new computation model called Sufficient Factor Broadcasting (SFB) that improves communication efficiency without affecting computational correctness. This paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it is the most relevant sub-category for this topic. It could also be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as it discusses distributed learning, and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as it proposes a new computation model. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as machine learning is a subfield of AI, and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as matrix-parameterized models are commonly used in computer vision applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
