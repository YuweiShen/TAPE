It also involves network communication and adaptation, which could place it in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. The paper also mentions the use of dynamic programming, which is a common technique in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a client-side buffer, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category.
