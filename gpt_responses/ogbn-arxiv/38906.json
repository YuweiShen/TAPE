Additionally, the use of spatial relations between objects and the analysis of contextual object detection problem are common topics in computer vision research. The paper also utilizes a probabilistic model, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of probabilistic models and the analysis of contextual inference also suggest that it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the difficulty of learning when the context and detector strongly disagree, which suggests that it may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
