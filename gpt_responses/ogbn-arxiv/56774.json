Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the algebraic properties of the qualitative calculi, which suggests that it may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses computational properties, which could place it in the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) or Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories.
