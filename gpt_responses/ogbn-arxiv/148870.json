This involves learning how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new situations and perturbations. The paper focuses on the application of this approach to control tasks, which suggests relevance to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The use of reinforcement learning and meta-learning suggests relevance to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the experiments involve adapting behavior in dynamic environments, which suggests relevance to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
