The paper also mentions applications to Bayesian statistics, which suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics Markov chain suggests a connection to probability (cs.PR) and the focus on online sampling suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on gradient evaluations suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
