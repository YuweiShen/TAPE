This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also applies the proposed methods to classification tasks using kernel methods and deep networks, which are subfields of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses convergence rates and assumptions on the objective function, which are relevant to the subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
