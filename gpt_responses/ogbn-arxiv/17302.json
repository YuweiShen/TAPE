The proposed algorithm is based on convex optimization tools and the barrier method, which are commonly used in control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also discusses numerical examples and performance evaluation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
