Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper uses distributed representations of words, which are a popular technique in ML, so cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely category. The paper also experiments with different approaches to MT evaluation, which could fall under cs.LG (Learning). The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) techniques, as it evaluates the quality of MT output, so cs.IR is another possible category. Finally, the paper uses vector representations of words, which are a popular technique in neural networks, so cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
