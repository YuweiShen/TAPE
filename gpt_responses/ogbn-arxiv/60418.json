The system also involves code-less patching, which is a technique used in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper proposes algorithms for optimizing calling context encoding, which is a programming language concept (cs.PL). The system is designed to impose low overhead and be independent of specific heap allocators, which are characteristics of systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses evaluation metrics to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
