Therefore, the most likely category is cs.AI, followed by cs.HC, as the paper also considers the role of human drivers in shared control scenarios. The paper also discusses the technical aspects of semi-autonomous cars, which falls under cs.RO and cs.SY, and the use of machine learning algorithms, which falls under cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
