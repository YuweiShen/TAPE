The sensors mentioned in the paper include cameras (cs.CV) and lidars (cs.RO), which are commonly used in robotics and mapping applications. The proposed method involves graph optimization (cs.LG), which is a common technique used in robotics and computer vision. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) to improve the calibration results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
