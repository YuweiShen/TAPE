This involves constructing semantic vector representations of image contents from textual labels obtained from pretrained image labeling software, and using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to construct semantic topic signals. The paper involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for image analysis, machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG) for constructing semantic topic signals and anomaly detection, information retrieval (cs.IR) for obtaining textual labels, and natural language processing (cs.CL) for constructing semantic vector representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
