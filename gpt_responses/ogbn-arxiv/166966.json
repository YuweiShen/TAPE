The use of regular expressions to extend the semantics of the logic may also be of interest to researchers in the areas of language and automata theory (cs.LG) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper's focus on complexity results and algorithmic techniques may also make it relevant to the area of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
