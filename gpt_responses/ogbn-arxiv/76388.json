It also involves the use of custom loss and segmentation techniques, which are common in computer vision research. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper is related to medical imaging (cs.MED) and neuroscience (cs.NEURON) as it deals with the quantification of emphysema in lung images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
