The proposed method involves sparse representation, feature learning, and gene selection. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and data mining, which suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning framework for tumor classification, which involves sparse representation, feature learning, and gene selection. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an integrated framework for tumor classification using microarray gene expression data. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves feature learning, which is a common technique used in computer vision and pattern recognition. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition sub-category.\n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves deep learning, which is a subfield of neural and evolutionary computing. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing sub-category.\n\ncs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves the analysis of microarray gene expression data, which is a type of biological network.
