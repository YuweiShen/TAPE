This falls under the domain of information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN), which are a type of wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme is designed to improve the spectrum sensing capability of CRSN, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a distributed sensing scheme for CRSN, which involves multiple nodes working together to sense the wideband spectrum. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme involves sensing the wideband spectrum, which includes various types of signals such as audio, video, and data. This falls under the domain of multimedia. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Cognitive radio networks are vulnerable to various security threats, and spectrum sensing is a critical aspect of ensuring secure communication. The proposed scheme aims to improve the spectrum sensing capability of CRSN, which is relevant to the domain of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
