This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper uses a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) to represent the 3D object model, which is a common technique used in computer graphics.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed method can be applied in robotics for detecting spatiotemporal interest points in 3D human motion dataset, which can be useful for robot motion planning and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with analyzing and processing 3D human motion dataset, which is a type of multimedia data.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, the proposed method involves detecting points where the local neighborhood has significant variations, which can be considered as a form of feature extraction.
