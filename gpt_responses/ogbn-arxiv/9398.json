The paper also discusses complexity and memory bounds, which are common topics in the areas of logic (cs.LO) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper proposes two approaches toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games, which involve algorithmic techniques and decision-making strategies, making it relevant to the areas of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and formal languages (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
