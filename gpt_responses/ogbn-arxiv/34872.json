This method allows for training GPs with billions of inducing inputs and also allows for training kernels based on deep neural networks without modifications to the underlying GP model. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new method for approximate inference in Gaussian Process models, which is a popular machine learning technique. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method that allows for training kernels based on deep neural networks, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper evaluates the proposed method on several benchmark datasets including MNIST and CIFAR-10, which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a method that allows for training neural networks and Gaussian Processes end-to-end without pretraining. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the proposed method could potentially be applied to large-scale network data, which is a common research area in this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
