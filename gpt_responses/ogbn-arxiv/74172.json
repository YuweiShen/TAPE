The paper proposes a new algorithm for online streaming feature selection with streaming samples, which is a problem that falls under the umbrella of online learning. The paper also introduces a novel criterion for measuring feature relevance based on class conditional geometric dependency, which is a concept that is commonly used in computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
