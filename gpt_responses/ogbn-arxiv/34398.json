The paper also addresses concerns about safety and security, which could place it under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of pruning techniques to make networks amenable to formal analysis suggests that the paper could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
