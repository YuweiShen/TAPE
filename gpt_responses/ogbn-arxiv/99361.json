The use of stochastic gradient feedback and zero-order optimization also suggests a focus on practical applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
