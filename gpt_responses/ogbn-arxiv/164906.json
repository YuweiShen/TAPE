This falls under the broad category of machine learning and statistics, which is covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category as the paper deals with developing a sample-efficient estimator for high-dimensional data. cs.IT (Information Theory) is also likely as the paper discusses the sample complexity of the estimator. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is another possible sub-category as the paper discusses the time complexity of the estimator. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.ST (Statistics Theory) are also possible sub-categories as the paper deals with statistical and machine-learning algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
