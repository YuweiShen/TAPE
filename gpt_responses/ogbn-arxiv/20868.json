The paper also focuses on reducing the amount of Channel State Information (CSI) feedback for FDD systems, which is related to Networked Systems (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI). The paper proposes a new clustering technique and uses graph theory to develop a low complexity groups scheduling scheme, which falls under the categories of Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
