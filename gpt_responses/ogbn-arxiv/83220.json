It proposes a novel off-policy policy optimization method to address the state distribution shift problem. Given the focus on reinforcement learning and policy optimization, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these fields often use reinforcement learning and policy optimization techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
