This involves using extractive summarization techniques and integrating both rating and textual aspects. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for estimating ratings and generating summaries, which falls under the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the integration of a personalized polarity classifier, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
