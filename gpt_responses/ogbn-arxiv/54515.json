Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as clustering and classification, which are often studied in the sub-categories of cs.LG and cs.SY. The experiments in the paper involve navigation and optimal stopping problems, which are typical examples of robotics (cs.RO) and control (cs.SY) problems. Finally, the paper mentions comparisons with existing IRL algorithms and direct methods that use feature statistics, which are common in the sub-category of cs.CR (cryptography and security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
