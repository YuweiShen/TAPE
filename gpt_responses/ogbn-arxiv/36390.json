This involves exploiting shared resources, which is a common theme in the computer security (cs.CR) and software engineering (cs.SE) fields. The paper specifically applies the attack to DNNs used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) tasks. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of linear algebra libraries such as OpenBLAS and Intel MKL, which falls under the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
