It also involves noise modeling and denoising algorithms (cs.MM), as well as classification (cs.CR), which are all relevant to the paper's approach. The proposed CNN architecture with constraints and supervisions also suggests a machine learning aspect (cs.LG), and the use of the spoof noise for classification involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
