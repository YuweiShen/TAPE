The main focus is on computer vision (CV) techniques for feature extraction and learning. Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel method for mutual learning, which involves training multiple classifiers and feature extractors. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.LG (machine learning), cs.MM (multimedia), and cs.AI (artificial intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with security and privacy issues related to surveillance cameras, which could place it in the cs.CR (cryptography and security) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
