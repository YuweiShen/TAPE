The paper proposes an efficient procedure to augment real images with virtual objects to create realistic composite images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also deals with 3D modeling and rendering techniques for creating virtual objects, which falls under the sub-category cs.GR (Graphics). \n\nThe proposed approach is aimed at improving the performance of object detection and instance segmentation models for autonomous driving, which falls under the sub-category cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of deep learning models for semantic segmentation and object detection, which falls under the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
