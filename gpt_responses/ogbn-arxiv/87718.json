This involves building strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while ensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. The paper addresses the case of $\\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, which is a natural way to represent functional requirements of systems. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with the synthesis of system controllers in the context of games against an antagonistic environment. Game theory is a natural fit for this problem.\n- cs.LO (Computer Science and Logic): The paper deals with $\\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, which are a type of logical formula. The paper also establishes the complexity of the problem, which is a typical concern in logic.\n- cs.AI (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the synthesis of system controllers that ensure high expected performance against a stochastic model of the environment. This is a typical problem in AI, where agents need to make decisions under uncertainty.\n- cs.DS (Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper establishes the complexity of the problem of building strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while ensuring a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
