The paper also discusses the use of loss functions and training methods, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper utilizes facial attributes to improve recognition performance, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the problem of matching sketches to photos, which could also be relevant to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
