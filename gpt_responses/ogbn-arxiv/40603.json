The paper also mentions the use of optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.LG (machine learning). However, given the focus on wireless communication systems and the use of interference functions, the aforementioned categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
