The paper discusses a programming model that factors out information flow policies from application code and database queries, and presents proofs of termination-insensitive non-interference and policy compliance for the semantics. The implementation is done in a Python web framework, which also falls under the software engineering category. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CR and cs.DB, followed by cs.PL, cs.SE, and cs.LO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
