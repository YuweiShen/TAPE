Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper introduces stochastic versions of Batch Normalization and max pooling, which are commonly used in Neural Networks, indicating a possible fit for cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
