The proposed framework, IRIS, involves both low-level controller imitation and high-level goal selection, which suggests a combination of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The datasets used in the evaluation include images and videos, indicating a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of learning from large-scale datasets, which could also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
