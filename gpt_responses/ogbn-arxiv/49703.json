It also involves computational aspects of finding optimal allocations, which falls under algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The concept of network externalities is related to social influence (cs.SI), and the paper proposes a new criterion for fairness, which could be considered a machine learning problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
