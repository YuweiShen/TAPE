The paper also discusses the correlations in the layer weight matrices of DNNs, which could fall under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes a new capacity control metric for DNNs, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
