This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents theoretical and empirical investigations of the convergence of these algorithms, which involves analysis of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as well as systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of selection functions used in MCTS, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
