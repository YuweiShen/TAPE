It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories as CNNs are a popular machine learning technology. Additionally, the paper discusses implementation on a CPU and an embedded ARM processor, which could fall under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.AR) sub-category as CNNs are commonly used in robotics applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
