The paper deals with a novel dataset for Reading Comprehension (RC) that motivates several new challenges for neural approaches in language understanding beyond those offered by existing RC datasets. The paper discusses the need for deeper language understanding and incorporating external background knowledge to answer questions from the second version of the plot, which requires complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
