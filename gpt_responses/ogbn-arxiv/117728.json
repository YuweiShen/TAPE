The paper also discusses the use of deep neural networks for image classification (cs.CV) and the prior over functions implied by neural network weights (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the calibration of predictive distributions (cs.SY) and the use of ensembles in deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
