It combines score function and pathwise derivative estimators and is applicable to both discrete and continuous action spaces. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, given the focus on policy optimization and the use of reinforcement and imitation learning, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
