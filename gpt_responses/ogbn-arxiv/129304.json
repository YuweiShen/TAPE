This is a common problem in database systems (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed scoring function combines attractive and repulsive dimensions, which is a concept used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses empirical evaluation and qualitative analysis, which are common in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
