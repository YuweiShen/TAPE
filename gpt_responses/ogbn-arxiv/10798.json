The paper discusses a novel modular framework that divides knowledge into four categories according to the depth of knowledge they convey. The paper also discusses the use of different information sources such as a knowledge-base, a list of names or document-specific semantic annotations. These features are used to train a conditional random field (CRF). The paper discusses the incorporation of deeper knowledge systematically boosts accuracy and compares KnowNER with state-of-the-art NER approaches across three languages (i.e., English, German and Spanish). Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
