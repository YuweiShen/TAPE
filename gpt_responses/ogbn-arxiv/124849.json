The use of deep learning models and the introduction of a new database suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses security concerns, which could place it in the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of auxiliary supervision, which could suggest a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
