The paper also presents a concrete characterization of a family of matrices based on their binary rank, which is a topic that falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses the Augmentation property to construct families of matrices with gaps between their real and binary/boolean rank, which is a topic that falls under machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
