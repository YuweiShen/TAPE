The paper also involves distributed computing, which falls under the sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The application of the protocol in evaluating trust relationships in a network suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of homomorphic encryption in the protocol indicates that it could be related to Information Theory (cs.IT).
