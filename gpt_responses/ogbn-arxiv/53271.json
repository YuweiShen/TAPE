The paper also discusses the effects of frequency offsets and phase noise, which are common in wireless communication systems, and thus, the paper could be relevant to the networking and internet architecture community (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents results for the averaged performance in additive white Gaussian noise and time-invariant multipath channels, which could be of interest to the multimedia community (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
