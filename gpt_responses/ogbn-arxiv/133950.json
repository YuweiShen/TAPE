The use of correlation amplifiers and zigzag-product expanders suggests connections to topics in computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on explicit constructions and derandomization also suggests connections to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
