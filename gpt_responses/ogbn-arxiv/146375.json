The paper proposes a meta-learning framework for model update in object tracking, which involves learning an online learning algorithm from offline videos. This involves using recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves optimization and control, which are subfields of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of neural networks for learning to update is a common technique in deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
