The focus of the paper is on reducing the complexity of training these methods by mapping the input features to a randomized lower-dimensional feature space. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including cs.SD (Sound), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
