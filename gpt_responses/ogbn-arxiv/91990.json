The method is based on a deep learning approach, which involves training a neural network to predict local features and global descriptors, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two benchmarks for large-scale localization, which involves working with large datasets and analyzing performance metrics, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
