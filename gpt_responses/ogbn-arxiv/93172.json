The title specifically mentions multiple hypothesis testing, which is a common problem in information theory and machine learning. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions applications to high dimensional estimation, which is a topic of interest in statistics and data structures/algorithms, hence cs.ST and cs.DS are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the mention of control systems in the abstract suggests that cs.SY is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
