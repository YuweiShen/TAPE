The paper also discusses the performance of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, which is a numerical analysis method (cs.NA) commonly used in compressed sensing. Additionally, the paper presents theoretical results on the performance of OMP, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP) and statistical theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
