This could be seen as an application of AI techniques to legal reasoning. \n- cs.LG: The paper describes a web-based tool for editing and visualizing Contract-Oriented (C-O) Diagrams, which involves processing and presenting graphical information. This could be seen as an application of machine learning or data visualization techniques. \n- cs.SE: The paper presents a formalism for representing contracts as diagrams, which could be seen as a software engineering problem. The web-based tools for editing and visualizing these diagrams could also be seen as software development projects. \n- cs.PL: The paper introduces a new formalism for representing contracts, which could be seen as a programming language. The web-based tools for editing and visualizing these diagrams could also be seen as programming tools. \n- cs.CY: The paper deals with the representation and manipulation of normative documents or contracts, which could be seen as a cybersecurity or privacy issue. The penalties resulting from the non-fulfilment of a contract could also be seen as a security concern."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
