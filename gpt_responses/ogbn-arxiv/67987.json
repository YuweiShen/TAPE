The loss function leverages inter-class relationships and uses the squared Earth Mover's Distance. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a method to automatically learn the ground distance matrix during training, which suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions age classification as an example of a real-life task, which could indicate that it belongs to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the proposed method can be generalized to applications that lack strong inter-class relationships, which suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
