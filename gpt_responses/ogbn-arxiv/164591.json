This involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI) techniques. The attacks proposed in the paper are adversarial in nature, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The evaluation of the attacks involves testing in real-world settings using a vehicle-mounted camera, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes a novel attack that involves creating signs that change as they are viewed from different angles, which could also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves training a model to recognize signs from different angles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
