The method uses a multilevel framework, which involves computing deformation fields on different scales, and this is similar to conventional image registration methods that are often studied in information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of deep learning also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
