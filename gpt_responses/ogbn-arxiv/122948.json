It also uses deep neural networks as a tool to solve the optimization problem. Additionally, the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category as it evaluates the proposed method on benchmark public datasets for several ordinal classification tasks. The paper also proposes a new performance metric for ordinal classification, which could be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also deals with natural language processing tasks, which could make it relevant to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category. Finally, the paper uses standard SGD for deep networks, which could make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
