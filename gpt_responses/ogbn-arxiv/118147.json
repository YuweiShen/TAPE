The framework involves partitioning variables and using causal solvers, which are techniques related to data mining (cs.DM) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of conditional independence tests, which are a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
