The paper also discusses the design of specific algorithms and presents experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
