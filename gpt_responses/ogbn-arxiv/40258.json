The use of optical flow and visibility maps also suggests a focus on image processing and computer vision. The paper may also fall under multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with video processing. The use of neural networks for motion interpretation and occlusion reasoning suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the use of linear fusion and the need for spatial and temporal coherence suggests a focus on graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
