The paper proposes a new encoding technique involving combinatorial message sharing and derives an achievable rate-distortion region for this technique. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves aspects of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) due to the use of quadratic Gaussian sources. The paper also involves combinatorial optimization (cs.DS) due to the use of combinatorial message sharing. Finally, the paper involves aspects of machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of codebooks and refinement techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
