This formulation is demonstrated across a variety of benchmark environments including stochastic-Atari, Mujoco, Unity, and a real robot. Given the focus on machine learning and robotics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves visual environments, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of optimization techniques and control theory suggests a possible fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
