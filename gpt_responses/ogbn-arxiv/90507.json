The focus on autoencoders and their constrained weights also suggests relevance to the sub-category of neural evolution (cs.NE). The use of the MNIST dataset and normalized object data suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV), while the use of the Reuters text categorization dataset suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the mention of classification accuracy suggests relevance to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
