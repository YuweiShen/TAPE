The use of network topology and channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) suggests that it may also fall under the categories of networking and internet architecture (NI) and systems and control (SY). The encoding scheme mentioned in the abstract also hints at the possibility of multimedia (MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
