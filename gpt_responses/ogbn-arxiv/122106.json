It also uses eligibility traces, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) categories as reinforcement learning is often used in these fields. The paper may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) category as it deals with optimizing control policies. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category as it proposes a new learning algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
