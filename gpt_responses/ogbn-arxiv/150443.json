The proposed approach involves extending an object recognition system with attention-based few-shot classification weight generator, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The redesign of the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine similarity function between feature representations and classification weight vectors also involves neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on Mini-ImageNet and a few-shot benchmark, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
