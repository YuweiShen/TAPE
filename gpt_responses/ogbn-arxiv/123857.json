The paper proposes a new semantics based on a combination of Autoepistemic Logic and Equilibrium Logic. These topics are closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), computational logic (cs.CL), and concurrency and parallelism (cs.CC). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
