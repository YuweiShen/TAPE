The use of Bayesian active learning and decision region determination also suggests a strong connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions planning problems for autonomous helicopters, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses evaluating edges on graphs, which could potentially involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
