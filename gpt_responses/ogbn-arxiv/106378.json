The proposed method is based on a deep learning framework (cs.LG) using long short-term memory (LSTM) structures. The paper also discusses a game-theoretic framework (cs.GT) for improving the cloud's decision-making process in massive IoT scenarios. The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (cs.AI) for predicting the state of unauthenticated IoTDs. Finally, the paper discusses the simulation results (cs.SY) of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
