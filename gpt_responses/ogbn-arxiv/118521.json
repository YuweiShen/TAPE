This involves learning abstract representations that are task-independent and can be grounded with problem-specific information for planning. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper involves transfer learning in two different domains, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of egocentric space and problem-specific information, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
