Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to combining image-only and joint-modality models, which involves machine learning techniques such as ensemble and consensus dropout fusion with shared parameters. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
