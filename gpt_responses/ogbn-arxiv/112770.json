The use of monads and the Curry-Howard isomorphism suggests that the paper may belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.PL (Programming Languages). The mention of formulae and proofs also suggests that the paper may belong to cs.LG (Computational Logic) or cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the mention of confinement and liveness properties suggests that the paper may belong to cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
