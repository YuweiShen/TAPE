Additionally, the paper uses a combination of linguistic knowledge and machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy, which falls under the scope of cs.CL. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of a large morphological lexicon, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Learning). \n\nFurthermore, the paper uses guided learning from a POS-annotated corpus, which falls under the scope of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and could also be classified under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as neural networks are commonly used in POS tagging. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with a morphologically complex language, which could be of interest to researchers in the sub-category cs.CY (Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
