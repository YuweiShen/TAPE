This involves signal processing techniques to achieve capacity-achieving MIMO transmission with limited RF chains. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses the hardware and power consumption costs associated with mmWave systems, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of path grouping techniques to mitigate inter-path interference, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AR (Augmented Reality)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
