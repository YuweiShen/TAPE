The paper also discusses the use of spatial correlation in channel estimation, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on the optimization of pilot length, which is a topic related to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
