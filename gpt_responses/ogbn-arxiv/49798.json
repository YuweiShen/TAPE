The proposed model involves training local classifiers using softmax loss functions, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The attention maps generated by the model can be seen as a form of feature selection, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of CNN feature maps, which are commonly used in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves benchmarking on datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
