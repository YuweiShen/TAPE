The paper evaluates different strategies for dealing with this problem on real-life datasets, using popular classifiers such as SVM, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. This work is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and cryptography and security (cs.CR), as imbalanced data can affect the performance of classifiers in various applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
