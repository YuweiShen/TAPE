It proposes dataflow reuse algorithms to improve resource efficiency by collaboratively reusing the outputs of overlapping dataflows. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Other likely categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as the paper deals with IoT applications, cs.DB (Databases) as it deals with data processing, cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it proposes algorithms for dataflow reuse, and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as it deals with the security of IoT applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
