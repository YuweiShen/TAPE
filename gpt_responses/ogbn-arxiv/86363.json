Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses benchmark results and validation of the conversion process, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper involves text recognition, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
