Additionally, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as abstractive summarization is often approached using machine learning techniques. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as summarization is often used in information retrieval systems. Finally, neural networks (cs.NE) may also be a relevant sub-category as many abstractive summarization systems use neural network architectures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
