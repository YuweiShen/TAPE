Specifically, it proposes unsupervised and lightly supervised algorithms for noun compound bracketing and paraphrasing, using the Web as a corpus and search engines as interfaces. This work is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
