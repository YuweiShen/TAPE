The use of convex and combinatorial optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the optimization (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the joint use of norm and sparsity constraints may have implications for signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
