It also involves optimization of link parameters, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The use of a look-up table (LUT) is a common technique in control systems and optimization (cs.SY), and the experiments involve simulation and analysis, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
