The paper proposes a new architecture for language modeling that involves a recurrent neural network (RNN) with separate hidden states for short and long context information. This architecture is an adaptation of the Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM), which is a popular type of RNN used in natural language processing. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several other sub-categories of computer science, such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and computer vision (cs.CV) since language modeling is a fundamental task in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
