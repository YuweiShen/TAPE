This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with indoor visible light communication, which is a type of networking and communication technology. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a rate adaptation method for communication in indoor visible light communication systems.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it is possible that machine learning techniques could be used for rate adaptation in visible light communication systems. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to overcome multi-path effects in visible light communication, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
