The paper also focuses on embedding KGs into low-dimensional spaces, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of literals such as text, numerical values, and images in KGs is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses the empirical evaluation of different methods for link prediction, which is a common task in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
