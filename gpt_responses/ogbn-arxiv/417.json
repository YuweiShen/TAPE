This suggests that computer vision techniques are used extensively in the proposed system. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the use of technology to improve patient care and reduce hospital acquired infections. This suggests that the proposed system involves human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential benefits of a smart hospital, which could increase operational efficiency and improve patient care with less spending. This suggests that the paper may touch upon societal implications of technology in healthcare. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions hospital acquired infections, which are a major concern in healthcare settings. This suggests that the paper may touch upon security and privacy concerns related to healthcare data. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions evaluating the proposed method for measuring hand hygiene compliance. This suggests that the paper may touch upon information retrieval techniques for analyzing and interpreting human movement patterns."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
