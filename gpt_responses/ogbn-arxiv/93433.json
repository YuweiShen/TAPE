However, since the paper specifically focuses on image classification and the use of minimalistic explanations, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The discussion of user perception and trust in the explanations also suggests a potential overlap with cs.HC. The mention of the LIME algorithm also indicates a connection to cs.AI. Finally, the use of deep neural networks for image classification could potentially relate to cs.CL, although this is less likely given the focus on explanations rather than natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
