This involves leveraging access to scientific simulators to learn such likelihood-free function mappings, which is a common theme in machine learning research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) due to the use of neural networks. The paper also involves simulation-based tasks, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
