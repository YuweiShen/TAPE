Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of scalable heuristics, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The exploration of real-world networks also suggests a potential connection to social informatics (cs.SI) and network science (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
