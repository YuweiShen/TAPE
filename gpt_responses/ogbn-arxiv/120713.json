The paper also discusses the use of metrics in MRMP, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of tools to analyze and predict the effectiveness of metrics, which is related to the field of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also proposes novel metrics adapted from the domain of shape-matching, which is related to the field of Machine Learning (cs.MA) and Computer Vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO, followed by cs.AI, cs.SY, cs.MA, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
