The paper also discusses model compression and sparsity-inducing regularization, which are common techniques in the sub-category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a method for selecting and detaching layers in the model, which is related to the sub-category of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also mentions experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests a connection to the sub-category of \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses model training with layer-wise dropouts, which is a technique commonly used in the sub-category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
