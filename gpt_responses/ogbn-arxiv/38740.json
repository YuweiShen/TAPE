The paper also proposes a deep network architecture for robust recognition of facial expressions, which involves learning from rich auxiliary attributes such as gender, age, and head pose, beyond just facial expression data. This suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves experiments and evaluations of the proposed model, which may fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper involves predicting interpersonal relations, which may also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
