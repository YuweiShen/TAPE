The paper proposes a data-driven method for motion deblurring of faces and conducts experiments on high-level face analysis tasks. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with motion deblurring of faces, which is a multimedia-related task. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a data-driven method for motion deblurring of faces, which involves training a model on a dataset. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for motion deblurring of faces, which involves using a model to extract and project identity information. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with motion deblurring of faces, which involves creating realistic motion blur by averaging frames. This could be considered a graphics-related task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
