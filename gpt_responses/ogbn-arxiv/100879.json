The paper focuses on the formal verification of the correctness and security properties of the MPC programs. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the implementation of the DSL, which suggests that it could belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also formalizes a deep embedding of WYS*, which could place it in the category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper deals with distributed semantics, which could place it in the category of cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the verified implementation of the interpreter, which could place it in the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
