The use of Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution and its extensions for this purpose is also mentioned. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed estimator in terms of its simplicity, speed, and competitiveness with other methods, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
