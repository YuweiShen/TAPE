The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method on KITTI, PASCAL VOC, and COCO datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a multi-scale deep feature learning network (MDFN) that efficiently detects objects by integrating multi-box, multi-scale, and multi-level technologies. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The proposed method involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper introduces a new network architecture that employs parameter-sharing to enhance computational efficiency, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
