The method involves capturing long-range dependencies among snippets using pyramid non-local operations. The proposed method is evaluated on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets, which are commonly used for action recognition and detection tasks. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques for action recognition and detection, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
