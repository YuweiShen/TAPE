The paper focuses on natural language processing and machine learning techniques to model the structure of documents. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a global model that can be applied to a collection of related documents, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses information ordering, which is a common problem in information retrieval, suggesting that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also leverages insights from discourse theory, which is a subfield of linguistics, suggesting that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
