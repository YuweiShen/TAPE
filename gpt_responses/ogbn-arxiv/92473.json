Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category as the method utilizes visual information to initially position the hand above the object. Machine Learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) are also likely sub-categories as the method uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize the grasping policy. Finally, Systems and Control (cs.SY) is a possible sub-category as the method involves closed-loop control of the robot hand to execute stable grasps."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
