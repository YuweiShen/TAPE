This involves the use of communication and networking techniques, making it likely to fall under this category.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the use of autonomous driving and vehicular sensing, which are key areas in robotics research.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper leverages estimated information on multi-path (AoA/AoD/ToA) and their geometric relations to formulate a complex system of equations or optimization problems. This involves the use of information theory concepts, making it likely to fall under this category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new technology for vehicular sensing, which involves the use of control systems and signal processing techniques.\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper discusses the detection of hidden vehicles using multi-path transmission, which involves the use of image processing and computer vision techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
