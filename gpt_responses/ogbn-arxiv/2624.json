The use of neural networks for performance prediction suggests that the paper may also belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions Halide implementations, which is a domain-specific language for image processing and computational photography, indicating that it may also belong to the computer graphics (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
