The paper proposes a new algorithm for learning manipulation skills that can train general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. The paper presents simulation and real-world results on a PR2 robotic manipulator. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
