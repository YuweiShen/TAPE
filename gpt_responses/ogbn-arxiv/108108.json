The paper also discusses applications such as watermarking and data hiding, which fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR) respectively. The use of partial information and the design of the transmitter subject to a cost constraint suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
