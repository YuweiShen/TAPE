The paper also discusses the use of the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm, which is a popular deep reinforcement learning algorithm and falls under the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of decentralized control architectures, which falls under the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents results of closed-loop locomotion, which involves computer vision techniques for terrain analysis and obstacle avoidance, falling under the field of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
