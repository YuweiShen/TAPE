The paper proposes an approach that learns from a small training dataset of annotated semantic parts and generalizes to detect semantic parts from a much larger range of viewpoints. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
