However, the specific problem of approximate containment similarity search is most closely related to database systems (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR), as it involves searching for records that match a given query. The proposed technique also involves sketching, which is a common technique in data structures (cs.DS) and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel technique that uses machine learning to improve accuracy, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
