The approach involves using a verifier to ensure that formal behavioral specifications are satisfied, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of model-predictive controllers (MPCs) and the extension of the MPC formulation with the gradient of the cost-to-go function suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
