The paper proposes a novel metric for automatic evaluation of dialogue systems based on utterance-level engagement. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and speech processing. The paper also involves machine learning techniques for predicting engagement scores, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed metric for improving human-computer interaction, which could fall under cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
