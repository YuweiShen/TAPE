This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI) as it involves optimizing the transmission of information over a network of antennas. The paper also proposes an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enabled hybrid precoding approach, which falls under the category of optimization and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of phased arrays and beamforming is a common technique in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
