The paper also discusses the behavior of MMSE and mutual information, which are important concepts in network information theory (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper provides a lower bound on the MMSE for finite length codes, which is related to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
