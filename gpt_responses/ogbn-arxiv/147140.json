It also involves the use of probability distributions and Markov Decision Processes, which are common concepts in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories as it deals with agents interacting with their environment and trying to maximise rewards. The Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category may also be relevant as it involves the analysis of computation time requirements for each algorithm. Finally, the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category may be relevant as the paper proposes a new methodology for comparing algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
