The use of Turing machines and program-size complexity also suggests a connection to the theory of computation (cs.DS). The paper also discusses lossless compression algorithms (cs.CR) and includes a numerical implementation of the Coding Theorem Method (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
