The use of Boolean functions and binary symmetric channels suggests a connection to computational complexity, hence cs.CC is also likely. The paper also involves probability and statistics, which could place it in cs.DS or cs.LG. Finally, the study of information transfer and mutual information could also relate to social networks and information retrieval, making cs.SI a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
