The proposed method involves the use of attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The method also leverages type hierarchies of entities, which are a common feature of knowledge bases and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
