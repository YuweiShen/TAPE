This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of transfer learning approaches and the proposed adaptive CNN architecture also suggest relevance to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and deep learning (cs.DL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
