This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses examples and models of communication systems, which could fall under the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The use of individual and common messages in the transmission suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
