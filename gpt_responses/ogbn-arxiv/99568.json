The paper also discusses the transmission rate, which is a key concept in information theory.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents a novel hypergraph theoretical approach to the centralized coded caching problem, which involves designing a placement delivery array. This approach involves constructing a linear and (6, 3)-free 3-uniform 3-partite hypergraph, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper discusses the problem of designing caching schemes with constant rate, which involves numerical analysis of the transmission rate and the number of users.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of reducing network burden in a wireless system, which is a topic in social and information networks.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the problem of designing caching schemes with constant rate and small F, which involves computational complexity analysis of the placement delivery array."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
