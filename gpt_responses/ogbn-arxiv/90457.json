However, given the focus on signal processing techniques and the use of Normalized-Least-Mean-Squared (NLMS) filtering, it is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the impact of phase noise on the performance of self-interference cancellers, which is a topic that is relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper presents simulation results that involve image and video data, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the design and optimization of a specific system architecture, which could potentially fall under the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
