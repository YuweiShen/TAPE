The methodology involves representing proteins using the word-embeddings of the SMILES representations of their strong binding ligands. This approach involves the use of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and comparison with other models such as KronRLS and SimBoost. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DB (Databases), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
