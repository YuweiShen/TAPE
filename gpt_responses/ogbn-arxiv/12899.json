This involves designing effective feature fusion methods and exploring complementary information between different streams. Given that the paper focuses on computer vision and machine learning techniques for video analysis, it is most likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach for end-to-end learning, which involves jointly optimizing a modality ranking constraint and a cross-entropy loss for both homogeneous and heterogeneous modalities. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Furthermore, the paper involves investigating correlations between different stream features, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the paper involves exploring discriminative action representation, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
