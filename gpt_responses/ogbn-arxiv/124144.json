The paper also addresses the issue of unachievable goals and the need for tailored solutions, which falls under the subfield of computational ethics (cs.CE). The paper also discusses the shortcomings of current approaches, which may involve security and cryptography (cs.CR) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
