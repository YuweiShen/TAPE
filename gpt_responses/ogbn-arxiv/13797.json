It also involves neural architecture search, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning suggests it could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the proposed elastic search tactic could be related to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
