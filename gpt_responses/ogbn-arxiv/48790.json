This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics) - The paper involves recovering surface geometry and albedo from RGB-D video sequences, which is related to graphics and rendering.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper mentions the use of a lighting insensitive robust pixel matching technique, which could be useful in robotics applications where lighting conditions may vary.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with processing RGB-D video sequences, which is a form of multimedia data.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses an expectation-maximization framework to recover surface normal and albedo simultaneously, which is a machine learning technique and falls under the domain of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
