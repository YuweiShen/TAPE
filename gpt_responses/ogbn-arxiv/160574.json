This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of deep features and bag-of-visual words (BoVW) also suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential of using these techniques for medical imaging, which could also relate to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
