The paper also uses techniques from coding theory (cs.DS, cs.CC) and multi-user communication (cs.MM) to derive bounds and achievable schemes for the PIR problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.CR, followed by cs.DS, cs.CC, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
