The paper also discusses the rate-distortion function, which is a fundamental concept in information theory. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with compression of correlated sources, which is a common problem in multimedia applications. The paper also discusses practical code design techniques, which are relevant to multimedia applications. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with distributed source coding, which is a common problem in networked systems. The paper also discusses the use of nested lattices, which are relevant to networked systems. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with distributed source coding, which is a common problem in distributed computing. The paper also discusses the use of low complexity techniques, which are relevant to distributed computing. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the complexity of the proposed techniques, which is relevant to computational complexity. The paper also discusses the use of low complexity techniques, which are relevant to computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
