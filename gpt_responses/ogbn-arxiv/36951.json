The paper specifically focuses on the use of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of land cover object classes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of Fully Connected Conditional Random Field (FCRF) model for post-processing the CNN outputs. This indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.GR (Graphics). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with remote-sensed images, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
