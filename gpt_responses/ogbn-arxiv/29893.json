Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the practical constraints imposed in the 3GPP LTE-A standard, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper proposes approximation algorithms, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
