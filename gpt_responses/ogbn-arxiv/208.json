The use of Gaussian MIMO channels suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The study of uncertainty sets and the optimization of signaling strategies may also relate to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
