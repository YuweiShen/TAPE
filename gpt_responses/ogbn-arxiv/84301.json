The paper also discusses communication failures and their impact on the performance of the system, which is a topic related to multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The proposed algorithm involves computing safe time horizons for each robot, which is a control problem and falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The algorithm is also agnostic to the task that the robots are performing, which suggests that it could be applied to a wide range of applications, including those related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
