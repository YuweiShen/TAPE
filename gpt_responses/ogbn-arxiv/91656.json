This involves synthesizing controls and planning over longer time horizons. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development and application of machine learning algorithms, which is a key component of the proposed algorithm. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category deals with the design, control, and perception of robots, which is a potential application domain for the proposed algorithm. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development and application of intelligent agents, which is relevant to the control and planning aspects of the proposed algorithm. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the development and application of neural networks and other bio-inspired algorithms, which is a key component of the proposed algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
