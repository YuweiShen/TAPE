The method uses local second-order information to approximate the variance of predictions across an ensemble of models, which is a technique commonly used in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses applications to out-of-distribution detection (cs.AI), detecting spurious correlates (cs.CV), and active learning (cs.NE, cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
