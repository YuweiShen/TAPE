The paper proposes a new method for eliciting expert prior knowledge about the similarity of the roles of features in the prediction task, which involves an interactive scatterplot display. This method involves human-computer interaction and falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also deals with text data, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper uses Bayesian linear regression for prediction, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Overall, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.HC, cs.IR, cs.CL, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
