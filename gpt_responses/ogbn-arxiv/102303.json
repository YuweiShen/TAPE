This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Speech and Dialogue Processing (cs.SD) or Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of phonemes and graphemes as subword units, which could also suggest a connection to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a novel technique to bias the RNN-T system towards a specific keyword, which could indicate a connection to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
