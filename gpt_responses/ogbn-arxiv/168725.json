The paper specifically focuses on automatic sequences based on Parry or Bertrand numeration systems, which are related to topics such as combinatorics on words and number theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
