The paper focuses on the development of a system that can successfully follow natural language navigation instructions to achieve navigation tasks in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
