The use of convex analysis methods to prove that the maximizing distribution is Gaussian suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The consideration of a cooperative upper bound on the sum-rate capacity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
