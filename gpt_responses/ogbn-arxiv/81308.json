The use of machine learning to develop a predictive model for selecting the appropriate DNN model also falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the optimization of DNN models for resource-limited devices is a topic of interest in the neural networks (cs.NE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
