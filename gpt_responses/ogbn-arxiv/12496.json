The paper proposes a novel disentangle-and-translate framework that involves learning independent but complementary representations of appearance and geometry latent spaces. This involves the use of a conditional VAE loss, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a geometry prior loss, which is a form of regularization that encourages the network to learn meaningful representations of the geometry space (cs.AI). The paper deals with complex objects, which may involve non-rigid transformations, and this requires a good understanding of geometric transformations (cs.GR). Finally, the paper involves multimodal translation, which is a problem in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
