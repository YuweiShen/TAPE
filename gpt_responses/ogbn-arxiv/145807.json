The use of limited peakedness input and peak-to-average power ratio constraints suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI) aspects. The proposed signaling scheme also involves optimization, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
