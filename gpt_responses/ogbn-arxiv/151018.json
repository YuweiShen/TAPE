The proposed indicator is based on the change in volume over time of the citing publications, which reflects the vitality of the impact of a researcher's publication output. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), computational complexity (cs.CY), information retrieval (cs.IR), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, since the paper focuses on bibliometric analysis and impact measurement, cs.DL and cs.CY are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.IR, cs.CR, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
