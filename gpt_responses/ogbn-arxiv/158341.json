The paper proposes a new method for generalized zero-shot learning, which involves adapting existing zero-shot learning approaches, making it likely to fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. The paper also introduces a new performance metric, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
