The use of statistical aggregation techniques and pre-trained CNN models also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing and comparing different methods, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of deep learning models and the proposed approach for dynamic scene classification could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
