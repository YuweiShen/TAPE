This involves pre-processing program units using static analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to obtain safe semantic approximations, and using an assertion-based code query language to express desired semantic characteristics of the code as partial specifications. The approach is fully automatic and does not rely on user annotations or documentation. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.PL (Programming Languages), followed by cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
