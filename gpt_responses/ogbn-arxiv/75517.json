This topic is closely related to computer security (cs.CR) as it aims to prevent unwanted behaviors that may compromise the stability and correctness of the environment. The paper also involves software engineering (cs.SE) as it proposes a new approach for designing and implementing software libraries that can be augmented with enforcers to ensure correct usage of resources. Additionally, the paper discusses programming languages (cs.PL) as it proposes a way to decorate libraries with proactive behaviors that can guarantee the correctness of the execution. The paper also touches on control systems (cs.SY) as it involves monitoring and modifying the behavior of apps to ensure correct usage of resources. Finally, the paper may be relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) as it involves coordinating the usage of resources among multiple apps running on the same device."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
