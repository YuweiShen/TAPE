The use of a discrete cosine transform module is a novel approach to address the vulnerability of CNNs to image quality degradation, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also presents a new version of traditional dropout, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with image distortions and their impact on classification performance, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
