This topic falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the potential security implications of these attacks, which falls under the sub-category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper uses computer vision techniques to generate adversarial examples, which falls under the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of these attacks on the performance of trained policies, which falls under the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
