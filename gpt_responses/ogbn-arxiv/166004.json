This involves using neural networks to estimate policies and state values, which is a key aspect of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The framework is formulated as a Markov decision process, which is a common approach in control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of hidden mechanisms among micro-structural features, which is a topic related to neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper focuses on the development of constitutive models, which is a topic related to software engineering and computational science (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
