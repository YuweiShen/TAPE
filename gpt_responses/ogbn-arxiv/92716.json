The paper discusses data management, data sharing, and data publication, which are all relevant to the field of digital libraries (cs.DL). The platform also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as researchers can access and create primary and derived data from a variety of sources. The platform also involves database management (cs.DB) as researchers can create private or shared workspaces to house data and access tools and computation. The platform also involves cybersecurity (cs.CY) as it deals with private data collections. Finally, the platform involves cryptography (cs.CR) as it deals with data citations and making scientific findings more credible and accountable."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
