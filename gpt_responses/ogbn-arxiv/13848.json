The study also involves hyperparameter tuning and model selection, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Lastly, the paper briefly compares the effects of two image preprocessing programs, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
