This involves incorporating numerical information and a mechanism of handshakes among members of the dynamic relation. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for the argumentation-based negotiation process, Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) for the concurrent multi-agent negotiations, Machine Learning (cs.LG) for the incorporation of numerical information, Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) for the mechanism of handshakes, and Game Theory (cs.GT) for the resource allocation aspect of the negotiations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
