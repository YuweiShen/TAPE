It also involves combinatorial principles and random 3SAT, which are related to discrete mathematics and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of cutting planes and weak automatizability suggests connections to linear and integer programming (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of small coefficients and quadratic equations may indicate some geometric or computational geometry aspects (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
