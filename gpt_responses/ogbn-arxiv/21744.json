Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also discusses the efficiency, modularity, and extensibility of the system, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of deep learning frameworks implies that it may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of source modalities, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) which deals with image and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
