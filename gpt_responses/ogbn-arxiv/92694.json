Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the flexibility and ease of use of spreadsheets, which relates to programming languages and paradigms, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) a likely sub-category as well. The use of spreadsheets in business-critical applications suggests a potential fit with cs.CY (Computers and Society). The paper also mentions the lifespan of spreadsheets and their use by multiple users, which could be relevant to cs.DB (Databases) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
