This is a classic problem in information theory, making cs.IT the most likely category. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper deals with the problem of duplicating substrings, which is a fundamental problem in string algorithms and data structures. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper may have applications in distributed storage systems, where mutations can occur due to network errors or hardware failures. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper may have implications for secure storage of sensitive data, where mutations can occur due to malicious attacks. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper may have applications in social networks, where mutations can occur due to user-generated content or network effects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
