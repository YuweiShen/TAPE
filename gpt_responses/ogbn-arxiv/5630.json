The proposed method involves estimating scene flow, which is a topic in graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of blurry color images also suggests a connection to image processing (cs.MM). Finally, the energy minimization formulation and the use of learning-based methods suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
