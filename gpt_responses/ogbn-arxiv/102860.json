Specifically, the paper presents a new algorithm for Q-learning with linear function approximation, which is a popular method in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also introduces a new oracle, which tests whether there exists a function in the function class that predicts well on one distribution but poorly on another, which is related to distribution shift and could fall under the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
