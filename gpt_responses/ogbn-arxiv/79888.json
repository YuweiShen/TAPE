The paper also proposes a new low-complexity near-ML decoding algorithm for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, which could fall under the computer communication (cs.CC) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses distance properties of random codes, which could fall under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents upper bounds on the ML decoding error probability and performance, which could fall under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
