The paper also proposes a novel channel model and analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the spectral efficiency, which involves system-level analysis and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the antenna characteristics and their impact on the system performance, which falls under the category of multimedia communications (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents a case study and simulation results, which are related to computer networks and communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
