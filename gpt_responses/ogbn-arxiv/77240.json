The use of signal temporal logic (STL) and the inference algorithm for discovering subgroups and their behavior patterns also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the method in analyzing data from a soccer match also involves sports analytics (cs.SI). Finally, the prediction of future group behavior under similar situations involves system dynamics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
