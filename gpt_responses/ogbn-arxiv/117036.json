The paper also mentions the use of source-channel coding (cs.MM) and the tradeoff between error exponents at different decision centers (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple sensors (cs.NI) in the context of distributed hypothesis testing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
