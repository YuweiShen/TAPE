The paper proposes a coding method to achieve an inner bound on the capacity region, which is a common topic in information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes a joint network and coding method for 3-receiver Gaussian broadcast channels, which involves both network and coding aspects. The paper also discusses the interference cancelation technique, which is a common technique in networking. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of characterizing the capacity region for Gaussian broadcast channels with receiver message side information, which is a common problem in social and information networks. The paper proposes a coding method to achieve an inner bound on the capacity region, which is relevant to the study of network capacity. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of characterizing the capacity region for Gaussian broadcast channels, which is relevant to multimedia communication. The paper proposes a coding method to achieve an inner bound on the capacity region, which is relevant to the study of multimedia communication. \n\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper proposes a coding method to achieve an inner bound on the capacity region of Gaussian"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
