Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new method called Pose Invariant PErson Recognition (PIPER), which involves deep convolutional networks and multiple cues, indicating that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method using experiments, which suggests that it may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
