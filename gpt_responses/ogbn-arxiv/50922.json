Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a systematic interpretation of model parameters and hidden representations, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG - Machine Learning). The proposed Feature Map Decoder is a novel contribution to the field of deep learning, which could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper validates the approach on a skeleton-based dataset, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM - Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the interpretability of the model, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC - Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
