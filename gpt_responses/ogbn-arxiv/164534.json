The paper discusses two paradigms for this task and unifies them within a theoretical framework. The paper also presents experiments on the QUESST dataset of MediaEval 2015 for Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection (QbE-STD) and lists results on the ABX evaluation task of the Zero Resource Challenge 2015 for comparison of the paradigms. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The other likely sub-categories are cs.SD (Sound), cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SD (Sound) which are related to the topics discussed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
