This is a common problem in database systems (cs.DB) and the proposed method involves learning embedding vectors (cs.AI) to encode census information. The use of knowledge graphs also involves semantic relations (cs.IR) and structured representations (cs.CL). Finally, the method involves weighting the embeddings to maximize performance (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
