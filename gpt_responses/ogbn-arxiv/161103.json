The focus is on discovering characteristic motion patterns in highly articulated objects, such as tigers, performing natural, unscripted behaviors. The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for analyzing large numbers of ordered trajectory pairs through time, which relies entirely on motion and is more discriminative than state-of-the-art features that employ single trajectories. The paper presents experiments on two datasets: dogs from YouTube-Objects and a new dataset of National Geographic tiger videos. The results confirm that the proposed descriptor outperforms existing appearance- and trajectory-based descriptors (e.g., HOG and DTFs) on both datasets and enables us to segment unconstrained animal video into intervals containing single behaviors. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
