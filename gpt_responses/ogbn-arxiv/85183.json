The paper also introduces a novel approach that uses symbolic constraints and an incremental Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver, which are techniques commonly used in the fields of logic (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the undecidability of policy synthesis of POMDPs with reachability objectives, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
