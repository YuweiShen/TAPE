Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the security aspects of communication systems, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper examines the effects of transmitting codes on unintended receivers, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also deals with capacity regions, which could place it under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
