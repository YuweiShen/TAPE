This technique involves both unsupervised distance-based schemes and deep learning schemes, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also applies the proposed technique to text-pair similarity estimation and text-pair relationship classification tasks, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI, while cs.CV and cs.IR are less likely but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
