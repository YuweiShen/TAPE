Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also mentions the use of monads, which are a fundamental concept in functional programming, suggesting a possible connection to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the extraction of witnesses from derivations, which could be relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions the use of reductions, which could be relevant to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
