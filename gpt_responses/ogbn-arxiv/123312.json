The paper proposes a new parameterized algorithm for the problem and introduces a new measure for the branch-and-search process. These topics are closely related to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
