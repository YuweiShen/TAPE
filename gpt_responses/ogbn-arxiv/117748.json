The proposed method involves ensembling of different classifiers, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Copula functions for ensembling is a statistical approach, which can also be related to the fields of neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
