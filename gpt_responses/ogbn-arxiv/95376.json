This is a topic that falls under numerical analysis. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the implications of the analysis for applications of neural networks in modeling and control. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the machine learning community. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the rate of convergence in L2 norm of the approximators. This is a topic that falls under information theory. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the implications of the analysis for control applications. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the systems and control community. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss computer vision or pattern recognition, the topic of approximation with parameterized functions is relevant to these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
