The use of pilot sequences and linear receivers suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. The focus on the number of antennas and their impact on system performance makes the paper relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the use of random matrix theory for analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computation and Language (cs.COM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
