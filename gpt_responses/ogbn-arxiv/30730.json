It also involves the use of polynomials, which is a common theme in information theory (cs.IT) and algebraic geometry (cs.AG). The testing involves intersecting cubes, which is a problem in computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper uses combinatorial techniques, which is a method commonly used in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
