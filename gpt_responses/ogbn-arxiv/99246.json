The use of perspective cameras and arrangements of points and lines in space suggests that the paper may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the classification and simplification techniques used in the paper may have implications for machine learning (cs.LG) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
