Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper proposes an algorithm for antenna selection, which involves system design and control, and hence falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also deals with the use of large number of antennas, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with energy efficiency, which involves power management and optimization, and hence falls under cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
