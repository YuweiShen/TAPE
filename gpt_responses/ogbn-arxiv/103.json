The concept of synchronizability is also relevant to formal languages (cs.FL) and logic (cs.LO). The paper introduces a new notion of location-synchronizing matrices, which is related to control theory and system dynamics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the synchronizability problem, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
