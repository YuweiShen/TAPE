The paper also proposes a modification of the Conditional Gradients algorithm to handle these constraints. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Regularizers, which are relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
