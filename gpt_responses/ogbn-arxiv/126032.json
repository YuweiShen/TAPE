The paper proposes a novel theoretical interpretation of the framework and performs experiments on various structured prediction tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
