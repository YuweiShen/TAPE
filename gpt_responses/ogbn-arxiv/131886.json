The paper proposes a new approach called multimotion visual odometry (MVO) pipeline, which extends the traditional visual odometry (VO) pipeline to estimate the full SE(3) motion of both a stereo/RGB-D camera and the dynamic scene. This approach does not require any a priori knowledge of the environment or the dynamic objects. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of computer vision and pattern recognition. The paper proposes a new approach for estimating motion from images, which is a core problem in computer vision. \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of robotics. The paper proposes a new approach for estimating motion from images, which is a key problem in robotics. \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of machine learning. The paper proposes a new approach for estimating motion from images, which may involve machine learning techniques. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of artificial intelligence.
