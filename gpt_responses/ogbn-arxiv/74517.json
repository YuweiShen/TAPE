The proposed method uses meta learning to automatically recommend appropriate FSS algorithms for a given problem. This involves identifying similar data sets and evaluating candidate algorithms based on multiple criteria. The most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DM (Data Mining). The paper also mentions the use of FSS algorithms in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
