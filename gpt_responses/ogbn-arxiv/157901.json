The use of wiretap codebooks and treating interference as noise are common techniques in physical layer security, which falls under the sub-category of network and internet security (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the symmetric case of the deterministic interference channel model, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to multimedia security (cs.MM) as secure communication is an important aspect of multimedia transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
