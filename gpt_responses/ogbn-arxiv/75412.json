The problem of minimizing the Age of Synchronization (AoS) is formulated as a Markov decision process, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also proposes a heuristic scheduling policy based on restless multi-arm bandit (RMAB), which is a popular technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
