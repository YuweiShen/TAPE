This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as covariance matrices are used to characterize the spatial correlation of wireless channels. The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method to a multi-cell network, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper involves statistical inference and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to the sub-categories of statistical learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper includes simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which could be considered as a multimedia computing and communication problem (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
