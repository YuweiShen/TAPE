The use of partial information and the formulation of different notions of manipulation suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the study of computational complexity, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The use of algorithms to solve manipulation problems suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves the study of strategic behavior in a social setting, which is a topic in game theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
