This involves addressing practical issues that arise when applying precoding over an aggressive frequency re-use HTS network. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of communication systems and their theoretical limits. The application of precoding to HTS systems involves optimizing the use of available resources to maximize system capacity, which is a topic of interest in information theory.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of communication networks. The application of precoding to HTS systems involves managing interference between multiple beams, which is a networking issue.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of computer hardware. The paper may discuss the hardware requirements for implementing precoding in HTS systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the analysis and control of complex systems. The paper may discuss the control mechanisms required to manage interference in HTS systems.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data. The paper may discuss the impact of precoding on the transmission of multimedia data over HTS systems."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
