This involves the study of information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of CC, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The analysis of the performance of CC over probabilistic traffics involves the study of stochastic processes and queuing theory, which are part of the field of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with network coding, which is a subfield of coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
