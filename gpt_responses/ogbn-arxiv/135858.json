The proposed solution involves a data-driven machine learning paradigm for power control, which is likely to fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
