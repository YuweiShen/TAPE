It also uses deep learning models for the task. The paper also involves learning a low-dimensional embedding, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of transfer-based methods and scored-based methods also suggests that the paper could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper deals with adversarial attacks, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of efficient search algorithms suggests that the paper could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
