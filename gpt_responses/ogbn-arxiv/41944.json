The proposed approaches involve deep learning models, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The task also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as the models need to identify relevant information from the text to generate a summary. Finally, the models use neural networks, which are a type of deep learning, making the paper relevant to deep learning (cs.DL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
