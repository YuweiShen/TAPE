This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of probability and confidence levels, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on various datasets, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
