This involves downsampling the set of vertices using a random spanning forest and using approximate solutions of Markov intertwining relation to provide a subgraph structure and a filter bank leading to a wavelet basis of the set of functions. The paper also provides explicit reconstruction formula, bounds on the reconstruction operator norm and on the error in the intertwining relation, and a Jackson-like inequality. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a new method for performing multiscale analysis of functions defined on the vertices of a finite connected weighted graph using a random spanning forest and approximate solutions of Markov intertwining relation. This involves downsampling the set of vertices and using a filter bank leading to a wavelet basis of the set of functions. This is likely to be of interest to researchers in information theory who are interested in signal processing and analysis. \n\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper provides explicit reconstruction formula, bounds on the reconstruction operator norm and on the error in the intertwining relation, and a Jackson-like inequality. This is likely to be of interest to researchers in numerical analysis who are interested in developing and analyzing numerical methods for solving problems in various fields. \n\n-"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
