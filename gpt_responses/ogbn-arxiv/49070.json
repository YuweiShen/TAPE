The use of deep reinforcement learning and sim2real approach suggests that the paper also falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with control systems and decision-making, which are subfields of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses mixed reality to simulate collisions, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
