Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves training neural networks, which suggests sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses issues related to training and tuning neural networks, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions using language models for parsing, which could relate to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) in terms of understanding and interpreting visual scenes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
