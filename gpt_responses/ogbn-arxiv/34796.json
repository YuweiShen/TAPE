The use of stochastic neural network architectures and training schemes falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of these techniques to video prediction also falls under robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
