The paper also discusses the use of embodiment in grounding symbols, which is a topic that falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The theory presented in the paper involves the use of nonlinearity and self-reproduction, which are topics that fall under the categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG).
