This involves collecting candidate API classes using pseudo-relevance feedback and term weighting algorithms, and ranking them using Borda count and semantic proximity. The paper also reports experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art studies and popular search engines. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as the paper deals with techniques for improving search results. Other likely sub-categories include Software Engineering (cs.SE) as the paper deals with code search, Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as the paper deals with natural language queries, Machine Learning (cs.LG) as the paper uses term weighting algorithms and semantic proximity, and Databases (cs.DB) as the paper deals with collecting and analyzing large amounts of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
