The proposed method involves enforcing sparsity through convex relaxations which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the framework is on a wafer stage which is a robotic system (cs.RO). The paper also discusses optimization of sampling sequences which falls under optimization and operations research (cs.OH). Finally, the paper deals with trial-varying disturbance attenuation which is a common problem in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
