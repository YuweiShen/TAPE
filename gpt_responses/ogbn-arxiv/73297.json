The use of virtual sector-based processing and uplink/downlink channel reciprocity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of directional training beams, which are a key feature of mmWave communication systems and may be of interest to researchers in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the design of efficient transmission schemes for multiuser MIMO systems, which is a topic that falls under the Communication (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
