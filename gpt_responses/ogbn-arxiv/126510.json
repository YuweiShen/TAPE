The paper also introduces a novel planning method based on trajectory optimization, which involves the use of machine learning techniques such as functional gradient optimization and Gaussian processes, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also utilizes continuous occupancy maps, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY).
