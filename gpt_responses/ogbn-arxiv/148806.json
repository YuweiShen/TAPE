Information theory concepts such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Compressed Sensing (CS) are used in the proposed scheme. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is focused on improving the performance of next generation wireless networks (5G) by proposing a beam alignment scheme for multi-user mmWave systems. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The proposed scheme involves finding the best beam pair for each user, which can be seen as a network optimization problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wideband mmWave systems, which are used for high-speed data transmission and multimedia applications. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although not explicitly mentioned, the proposed scheme involves using Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) technique to efficiently find the strongest path connecting the BS and each user, which can be seen as a machine learning approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
