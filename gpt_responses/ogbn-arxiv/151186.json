The paper also discusses the complexity of the problems, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions directed acyclic graphs and oriented trees, which are topics commonly studied in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
