The paper also uses graph-theoretic approaches, which are relevant to the subfields of computer science dealing with algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper includes simulation results to compare the performance of the proposed codes, which could be relevant to the subfield of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
