The proposed method uses deep reinforcement learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it introduces a BM25-based IR baseline. Finally, the method involves learning sequential reasoning across large collections of documents, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
