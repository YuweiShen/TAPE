The approach proposed in the paper involves using bug history to predict fault-proneness, which involves machine learning techniques and could fall under the cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. The paper also discusses the use of neural network models, which could fall under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category.
