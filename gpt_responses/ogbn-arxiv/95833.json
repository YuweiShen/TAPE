Computer vision is a key application area for cross-modal retrieval, and the paper uses image and text data sets for evaluation. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Cross-modal retrieval is a key problem in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant information across different modalities such as text, image, and video. The paper proposes a novel approach for cross-modal retrieval using deep generative hashing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning approach for cross-modal retrieval, which involves learning hash functions using adversarial training and cycle consistency loss. Machine learning is a key component of the proposed approach. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): Cross-modal retrieval is a key problem in multimedia, where the goal is to retrieve relevant multimedia content across different modalities such as text, image, and video. The paper proposes a novel approach for cross-modal retrieval using deep generative hashing, which is evaluated on image and text data sets. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves learning hash functions for cross-modal retrieval between text and image modalities. Computation and language is a key area of research for cross-modal retrieval involving text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
