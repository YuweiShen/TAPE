The proposed method utilizes clustering to divide the collected states into several clusters and gives a bonus reward reflecting both novelty and quality in the neighboring area (cluster) of the current state to guide the exploration of the agent. Therefore, this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper proposes a new RL framework that utilizes clustering, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This paper proposes a new RL framework that aims to improve the exploration strategy of the agent, which is a common problem in AI. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): Efficient exploration is a crucial problem in robotics, and this paper proposes a new RL framework that can potentially be applied to robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): RL is a common technique in systems and control, and this paper proposes a new RL framework that can potentially be applied to systems and control. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although this paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the proposed method can potentially be applied to RL problems that involve visual inputs, such as \\emph{Atari 2600} games. Therefore, this paper may also belong to cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
