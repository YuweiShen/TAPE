The paper also discusses the use of parametric and non-parametric models to describe gaze patterns, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the motivation for this problem in an unobtrusive biometric setting, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Gaussian process priors to infer densities, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
