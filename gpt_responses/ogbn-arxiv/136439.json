The paper also introduces a new algebraic structure for propositional logic, which falls under the subfield of programming languages (cs.PL). The use of inverse limit construction to deal with infinite objects is a technique commonly used in the subfield of model theory (cs.MS). The paper also discusses the limitations of classical connectives in the sequential case, which is a topic studied in the subfield of formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the use of congruences to define valuation equivalences, which is a topic studied in the subfield of distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
