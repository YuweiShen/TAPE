The paper also discusses the extension of Miller et al's framework of uniform proofs, which is a topic related to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the soundness of the proposed framework relative to coinductive models, which is a topic related to computational logic (cs.CL). The paper also deals with the construction of infinite data, which is a topic related to type theory and formal languages (cs.LF). Finally, the paper proposes a proof-theoretic framework for handling coinduction, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
