Additionally, the use of linear programming and polytopes suggests a connection to mathematical optimization (cs.OC) and theoretical computer science (cs.THE). However, based on the focus of the paper on specific algorithms and their performance, the aforementioned sub-categories are more likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
