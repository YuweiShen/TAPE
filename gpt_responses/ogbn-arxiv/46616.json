The framework involves signal decomposition, sparse signal reconstruction, and spectral peak tracking with verification. This involves machine learning techniques and computer vision techniques, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of cs.LG and cs.CV. The paper also discusses the potential applications of the framework in wearable devices, which falls under the sub-category of cs.HC. Additionally, the paper involves the use of physiological signals, which is relevant to the sub-categories of cs.NE and cs.BIO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
