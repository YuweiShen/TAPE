It introduces a new code reuse technique called Block Oriented Programming (BOP) and a mechanism called BOPC to automatically assess whether an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a binary hardened with CFI/shadow stack defenses. The paper involves techniques from computer security (cs.CR), software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), systems and control (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG) to develop and evaluate the BOPC mechanism. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.SE, cs.PL, cs.SY, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
