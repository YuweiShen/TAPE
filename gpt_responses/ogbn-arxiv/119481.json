The paper specifically focuses on the protocols and architectures used in these networks, which is related to optical networking (cs.OT) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses user-perceived performance, which is related to communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper proposes a research framework for the comparative analysis of different network architectures, which could be considered as an application of artificial intelligence and robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
