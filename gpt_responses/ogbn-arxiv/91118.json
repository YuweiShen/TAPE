This involves leveraging automation mechanisms in networking and cloud computing management systems. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes an architectural scheme based on SDIs and includes a new training plane and an AI-aaS plane to deal with the model-development and operational phases of AI applications, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the monitoring, analysis, policy, execution plus knowledge (MAPE-K) loop (MKL) for each AI-aaS application, which could be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents experimental measurement results for three AI-aaS applications, which could be classified under cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it involves the development and deployment of software systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
