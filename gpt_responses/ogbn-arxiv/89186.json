This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to capture complex relationships between program instructions and their performance metrics. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to capture performance metrics for each resource type when it executes different program instructions under varying degrees of resource contention. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning category.\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a transformation of the input workflow into a Physical Resource Execution Plan (PREP) to model an arbitrarily complex workflow as a set of simpler programs running on physical nodes. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering category.\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a transformation of the input workflow into a Physical Resource Execution Plan (PREP) to model an arbitrarily complex workflow as a set of simpler programs running on physical nodes.
