It also involves formalizing the notion of plan robustness, which is a key concept in planning and scheduling (cs.PL). The proposed approach involves compiling the problem to a conformant probabilistic planning problem, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The experimental results involve using a state-of-the-art planner, which is a common practice in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with domain modeling, which is a key aspect of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
