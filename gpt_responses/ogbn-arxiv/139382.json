The proposed masking schemes and embedding/aggregating methods are specifically designed to address the issue of feature redundancy and improve retrieval accuracy, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The inclusion of a hashing module also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
