The focus is on interpretability, which suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), or computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). The use of Bayesian neural networks and sparsity inducing prior distributions also suggests a potential fit with the sub-categories of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
