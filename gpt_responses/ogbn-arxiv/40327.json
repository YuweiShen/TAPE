The use of Deep Learning architecture also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as facial analysis is often used in multimedia applications. Finally, the use of dual cascaded CNN subnetworks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
