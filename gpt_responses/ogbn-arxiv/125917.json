This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SP), information theory (cs.IT), systems and control (cs.SI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper proposes an adaptive combination of l0-LMS filters to address this problem, which involves designing a suitable combination structure and updating the combining parameter efficiently. These are topics that are likely to be of interest to researchers in the above-mentioned sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
