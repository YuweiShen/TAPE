This involves the use of multi-task generative adversarial nets with shared memory for cross-domain coordination control. The paper focuses on the application of this method in collaborative factory automation, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
