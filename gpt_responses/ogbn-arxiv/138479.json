This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper proposes several deep CNN architectures that consider multi-scale patches or take explicit location features while training, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also discusses the performance levels of the machine and the independent human observer, suggesting a possible interest in neural networks (cs.NE) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
