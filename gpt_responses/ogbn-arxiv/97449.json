The paper also proposes a new approach to learning local feature descriptors using weak supervision, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of siamese convolutional neural networks also suggests a possible fit under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the estimation of homography parameters, which is a common problem in optimization and numerical methods (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
