The paper provides tight bounds and approximation algorithms for the problem with respect to various structural parameters of the input graph, such as clique-width, treewidth, vertex cover, and tree-depth. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
