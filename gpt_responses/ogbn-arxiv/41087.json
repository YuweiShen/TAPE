The paper also discusses the interpretation of the extracted program in a model, which is related to denotational semantics (cs.DS). The use of let-polymorphism and the formal description of the notion of size for polymorphic functions suggest that the paper may also be relevant to type theory (cs.THEORY). Finally, the paper provides a formal foundation for cost recurrence extraction, which is a topic that is relevant to the analysis of algorithms (cs.LO) and functional programming (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
