Game theory is a natural fit for studying such markets, and the paper discusses the interplay between learning and market objectives. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a learning model for one side of the market that does not have a priori knowledge about its preferences for the other side and is required to learn these from stochastic rewards. The paper extends the standard multi-armed bandits framework to multiple players, with the added feature that arms have preferences over players. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a learning model for stable matching, which is a fundamental problem in AI and has applications in many real-world scenarios. The paper discusses the exploration-exploitation trade-offs in the proposed model. \n4. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper proposes a learning model for multiple players in a matching market, which is a natural fit for the multiagent systems sub-category. The paper discusses both centralized and decentralized approaches to the problem. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the stable matching problem, which is a fundamental problem in social networks and has applications in online dating, job markets, and other scenarios.
