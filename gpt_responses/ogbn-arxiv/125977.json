The paper also discusses the use of images as inputs, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The application of the method to robotics (cs.RO) is also mentioned. The paper proposes a new method for semi-supervised reinforcement learning, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
