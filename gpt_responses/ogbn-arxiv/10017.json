The paper also discusses the modeling of fingerprinting as a communications problem, which is a common approach in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of typical coalitions to obtain lower bounds is a technique often used in coding theory and information theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of mutual information quantities, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.MM, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
