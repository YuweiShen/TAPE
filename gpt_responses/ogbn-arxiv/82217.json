The paper proposes a graph learning approach to estimate the interference environment of a wireless network based on passive traffic monitoring. This involves observing network traffic transmission patterns and collecting information on transmission successes and failures to identify the interference graph reliably with high probability. The paper also establishes bounds on the number of observations required to achieve this goal and provides scaling laws for the observation requirements in terms of the network size and the maximum number of interfering transmitters per node. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a practical algorithm for interference estimation. Overall, the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), systems and control (cs.SY), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
