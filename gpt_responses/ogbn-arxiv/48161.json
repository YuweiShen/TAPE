It proposes a relational actor programming model for in-memory databases, which is a holistic approach towards fulfilling these challenging requirements. The paper discusses the design of ReactDB, a system design exposing reactors that allows for flexible virtualization of database architecture. Therefore, this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DB (Database) - as the paper proposes a new approach towards fulfilling the requirements of OLTP database systems. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - as the paper discusses the intra-transaction parallelism and state encapsulation in their applications to reduce latency and improve locality. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages) - as the paper proposes a relational actor programming model for in-memory databases. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - as the paper discusses the design of ReactDB, a system design exposing reactors that allows for flexible virtualization of database architecture. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering) - as the paper proposes a new approach towards fulfilling the challenging requirements of OLTP database systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
