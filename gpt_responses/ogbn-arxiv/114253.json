These topics are closely related to information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of antenna configurations for full-duplex millimeter-wave transmission, and explores the potential benefits of full-duplex communication in a multi-user scenario. These topics are relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of millimeter-wave communication for full-duplex transmission, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes signal processing approaches to mitigate self-interference and multi-user interference, which are related to control and optimization of communication systems. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): While the paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to communication technology, it may have implications for the design and deployment of future communication systems, which could be relevant to the computers and society sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
