It also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category as it proposes a novel ResNet-like architecture that combines multi-scale context with pixel-level accuracy. This involves the use of residual connections, which are a popular technique in deep learning. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category as it deals with the development of autonomous driving systems, which is an application of AI. \n\nThe Robotics (cs.RO) category may also be relevant as the paper deals with navigation and action planning, which are important tasks in robotics. \n\nFinally, the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category may also be relevant as the paper deals with the processing of street scenes, which may involve sensitive information such as license plates and faces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
