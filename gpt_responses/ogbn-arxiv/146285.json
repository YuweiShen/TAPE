Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques such as image-based visual servoing and apriltag recognition, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of a smart edge device and the need for real-time control and communication suggest that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions the use of deep-learning recognition systems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
