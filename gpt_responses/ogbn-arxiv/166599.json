The use of sample access and testing algorithms suggests that this paper could also be categorized under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the focus on testing and verifying properties of distributions could also place this paper under social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
