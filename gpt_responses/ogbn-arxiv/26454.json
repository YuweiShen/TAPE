The paper also discusses the use of active learning approaches (cs.AI) and model-based formulations of curiosity (cs.CV) to optimize sampling strategies for training data. Additionally, the paper presents a validation dataset of action-conditioned video of robotic manipulation tasks, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
