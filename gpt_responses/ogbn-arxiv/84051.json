The paper proposes a novel approach to domain generalization, which involves training a model to solve a jigsaw puzzle on the same images it is learning to recognize. This approach involves both supervised and unsupervised learning, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of semantic labels, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses neural networks, which is a common topic in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
