This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computer science related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL) as these are the areas where XAI and LRP are commonly used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
