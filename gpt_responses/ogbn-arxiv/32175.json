The paper also discusses the use of LSTM for addition of decimal numbers, which falls under natural language processing and sequence modeling, hence cs.CL is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses navigation in Minecraft, which involves computer vision and robotics, hence cs.CV and cs.RO are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of Teacher-Student algorithms, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning and deep learning, hence cs.AI is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
