The focus of the paper is on a sequential setting without substitutions, which is a variant of the problem that has not been extensively studied before. This suggests that the paper is likely to be in the area of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) or machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes an efficient algorithm and analyzes its approximation factor, which indicates that it may be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with a practical problem of selecting centers from a finite sequence of i.i.d. samples, which suggests that it may be relevant to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
