The paper also proposes a distributed algorithm for estimating the rigidity eigenvalue associated with the weighted framework, which involves the use of linear algebra and graph theory, and thus could be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Mathematics of Computing (cs.MA). The use of range measurements and bearing measurements for estimating the relative positions of the robots could also fall under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper experimentally validates the proposed approach in a cluttered environment, which could be categorized under Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
