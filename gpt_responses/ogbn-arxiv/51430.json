Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the interface for creating interactive educational material, which suggests that it could also belong to the Education (cs.EDU) category. The paper also mentions the use of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) and Logic Production System (LPS), which are both related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper describes the architecture of the web server and client application, which could also be relevant to Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
