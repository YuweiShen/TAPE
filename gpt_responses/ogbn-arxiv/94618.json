The paper deals with methods for teaching machines to answer visual questions, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of language models for answering questions, which relates to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper presents a novel approach for handling new domains without relying on training examples, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
