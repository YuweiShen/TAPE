It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with neural networks. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep learning is a subfield of AI. The paper also mentions the use of neural nets for multi-class classification, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's investigation of the degrees of freedom in deep networks could also place it under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
