The paper discusses the use of distributed representation to alleviate data sparsity and proposes a novel spatiotemporal aware (STA) representation that models the spatial and temporal information as a relationship connecting users and POIs. This paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it deals with recommendation systems and the retrieval of relevant POIs for users. It could also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as it deals with location-based social networks. The paper also discusses the use of knowledge graph embedding, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of data sparsity and cold start problem could also place it in the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with recommendation systems, which could place it in the Social and Economic Networks (cs.SOC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
