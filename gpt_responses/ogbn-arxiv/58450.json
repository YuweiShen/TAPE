These issues are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including multimedia (cs.MM), computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), information theory (cs.IT), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). However, given that the paper proposes a new approach that shifts most of the burden due to interactivity from the decoder to the encoder, and uses optimization techniques based on user behavior modeling to minimize the cost of transmission rate and storage, it is most likely to belong to the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
