The paper also presents algorithms for maximizing the overall size of packets that are successfully transmitted, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the tension between two conflicting algorithmic approaches, which is a topic that falls under the category of optimization and control (cs.PF) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
