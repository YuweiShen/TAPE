The concept of malleability is also relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and cryptography (cs.CR), which are both closely related to information theory. Finally, the paper establishes connections to coded side information (cs.SI), which is a subfield of information theory that deals with the transmission of correlated data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
