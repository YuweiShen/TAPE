Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel network architecture and visualization technique, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of ConvRes blocks and recurrent-feature aware visualization technique also suggests the relevance of cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The problem of detecting objects in aerial scenes also involves robotics and automation, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper deals with visual data, which suggests the relevance of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
