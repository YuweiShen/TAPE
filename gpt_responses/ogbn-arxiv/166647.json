This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of natural language processing techniques to extract arguments also suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also deals with knowledge representation and management, which falls under the category of databases (cs.DB). Finally, the focus on creating an explainable method suggests a connection to the field of computational transparency (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
