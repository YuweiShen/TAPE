This involves combining Neuroevolution techniques with off-policy training and proposing a novel architecture mutation operator. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. The proposed approach in this paper involves combining Neuroevolution techniques with off-policy training to automatically find strong neural network topologies for continuous control tasks, which falls under the scope of this sub-category. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development of intelligent agents and systems. The proposed approach in this paper involves using Deep Reinforcement Learning to train agents for continuous control tasks, which falls under the scope of this sub-category. \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.
