This falls under the domain of robotics and hence, cs.RO is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel maneuver optimization approach that combines domain knowledge with Reinforcement Learning methods. This falls under the domain of AI and hence, cs.AI is the second most likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new autonomous collision avoidance system that requires control over the spacecraft. This falls under the domain of systems and control and hence, cs.SY is the third most likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new software tool for optimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. This falls under the domain of software engineering and hence, cs.SD is the fourth most likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new software tool for optimizing collision avoidance maneuvers.
