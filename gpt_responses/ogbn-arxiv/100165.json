Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves the study of functions with the bent property, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and computer science, making cs.COMM (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) likely categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of algebraic codes, which falls under the category of cs.SI (Systems and Control) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
