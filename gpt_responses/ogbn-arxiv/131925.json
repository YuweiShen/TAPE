This falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the efficiency of signature schemes compared to symmetric primitives, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), computer engineering (cs.CE), or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
