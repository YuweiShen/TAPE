The paper also proposes a model-based metric to estimate factual accuracy, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The large-scale dataset used in the paper is based on Wikipedia and Wikidata, which are commonly used in information retrieval and knowledge representation research (cs.IR). The paper also involves analyzing multiple models and conducting a human evaluation study, which are common practices in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the end-to-end fact extraction models used in the paper involve neural networks and deep learning, which are also commonly used in neural engineering research (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
