It also involves self-supervised learning, which is a popular topic in computer vision research. The paper also mentions robotics (cs.RO) as a potential application of their method. Additionally, the use of epipolar geometry suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also involves optimization and machine learning, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
