This involves processing a large number of streamlines containing information on structural connectivity. The proposed method uses kernel dictionary learning and sparsity priors to group streamlines into meaningful bundles. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), or computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
