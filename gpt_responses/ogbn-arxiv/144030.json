The paper also uses tools from Markov processes and large deviation theory, which are commonly used in the fields of control systems (cs.SY) and applied mathematics (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper establishes a discrete state model, which is a technique often used in the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
