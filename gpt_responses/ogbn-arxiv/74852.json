Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the interference management capabilities of centralized decoding at the cloud, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The study also sheds light on effective design choices as a function of fronthaul capacity constraints, which is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions the multiplexing of enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) users, which involves multimedia processing (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
