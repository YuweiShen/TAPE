Additionally, the problem involves constraints and optimization, which could place it in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of submodular utility functions also suggests a possible connection to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
