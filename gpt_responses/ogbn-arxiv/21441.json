The proposed method involves encryption (cs.MM) and manipulation of the color components of an image (cs.CV). The use of a secret key and encryption algorithm also suggests the involvement of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the visual quality of stego images, which falls under computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
