Therefore, cs.SD (Sound) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses multiple instance learning (MIL) and pooling functions, which are common topics in the sub-categories of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper proposes a new neural network architecture, which could also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
