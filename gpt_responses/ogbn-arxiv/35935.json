This involves the study of information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI) to ensure timely delivery of data. The focus on perfect feedback and heterogeneous erasure probabilities suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of uncoded packets at key times for effective delay control may involve multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
