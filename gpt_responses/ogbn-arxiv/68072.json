It also involves the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a new approach to solving the problem, which involves the use of a discriminative training criterion, and transfer learning, which are techniques commonly used in the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of a modular structure, which is a common technique in the sub-category of Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves the use of a progressive pretraining regimen, which is a technique commonly used in the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
