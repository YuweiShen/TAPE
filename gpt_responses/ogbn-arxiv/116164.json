The problem of realizing a degree sequence is a classic problem in graph theory and falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of flips to transform one graph into another is a topic in graph theory and falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The study of nested collections and connected subgraphs is a topic in graph theory and falls under the category of graph theory (cs.GT). The algorithmic approach and approximation algorithm used in the paper falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
