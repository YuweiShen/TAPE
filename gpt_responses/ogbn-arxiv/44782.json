Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also evaluates the performance of different CFI mechanisms, which involves programming language concepts and compiler-based implementations, suggesting possible sub-categories of cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the empirical evaluation of the mechanisms, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
