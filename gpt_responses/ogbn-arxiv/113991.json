Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of web queries to identify extrapositional cases suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the system's performance also suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of syntactic rules suggests a possible connection to computational linguistics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
