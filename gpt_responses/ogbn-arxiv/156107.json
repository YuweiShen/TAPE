Additionally, the paper focuses on machine learning and feature engineering, which are topics commonly found in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of Graph Neural Networks also suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category.
