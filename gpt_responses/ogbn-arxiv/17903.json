This involves designing an interactive system that is easy to use and provides visual feedback to the user. \n3. cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity): The paper briefly mentions the need for a secure and reliable infrastructure to support the distributed AR training tool. This may involve addressing cybersecurity concerns related to data privacy and network security. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions the use of real-time deformable medical models, which may involve robotics techniques for modeling and simulating the behavior of soft tissues. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper introduces a novel adaptive synchronization algorithm (ASA) to maintain a shared state among participants in the collaborative AR environment. This may involve techniques from social and information networks to optimize the communication and coordination among distributed users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
