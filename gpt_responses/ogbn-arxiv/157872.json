It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it explores the ability of neural networks to approximate functions. Additionally, it could be categorized under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) as it investigates the robustness of neural networks to internal perturbations. The paper also involves experimentation and analysis, which could place it under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, it could be categorized under computational linguistics (cs.CL) as convolutional neural networks are also used in natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
