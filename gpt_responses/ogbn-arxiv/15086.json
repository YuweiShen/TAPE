This approach involves creating a dependency tree where each dependency relation corresponds to an instance of temporal anaphora. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
