The use of transfer learning is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) to improve performance on small datasets. The paper also discusses the use of connectionist temporal classification (CTC), which is a technique used in speech recognition (cs.IR) and handwriting recognition (cs.CV). Finally, the paper uses artificial neural networks, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
