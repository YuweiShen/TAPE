The paper also discusses the operational consistency of responses to queries, which is a concern in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper proposes a restricted system that achieves a good compromise between the power and utility of the Prolog cut and the need for internal consistency, which suggests that it belongs to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
