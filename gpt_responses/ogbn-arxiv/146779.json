This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and cybersecurity and privacy (cs.CR) sub-categories. The proposed defense strategies are based on wavelet domain denoising, which involves manipulating and analyzing the input data at a granular level, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on iris recognition, which is a subfield of image recognition (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
