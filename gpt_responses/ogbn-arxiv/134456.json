The use of decision trees and random forests for classification suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on Internet Protocol (IP) group and SNMP-MIB dataset suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of network infrastructure (cs.NI). The use of machine learning for anomaly detection and intrusion detection systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
