The addition of deadlines adds a temporal constraint to the problem, which is also relevant to the field of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also presents an algorithm based on integer linear programming, which is a common technique in optimization and operations research (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses a reduction to a flow problem, which is a topic in graph theory and network optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
