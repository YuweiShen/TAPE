This involves techniques related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), and machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the system performance and theoretical properties of the Sigma-Delta approach, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
