The use of onboard cameras and feature extraction for pose estimation involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The distributed nature of the control strategy and the need for collision avoidance suggest the involvement of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of algorithms for pose estimation and control suggest the involvement of machine learning and optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the use of novel algorithms for pose estimation and control suggest the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
