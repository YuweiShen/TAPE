It also involves the use of mathematical models (cs.PL) and statistical analysis (cs.LG) to evaluate the impact of errors in early size predictions on effort estimation. The paper also discusses the COCOMO model, which is a well-known software cost estimation model (cs.SD). Finally, the paper uses Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the impact of errors, which is a common technique in computational science (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
