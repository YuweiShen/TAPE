The proposed approach is based on word embeddings, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a dictionary and various methods of query translation and aggregation, which are common techniques in natural language processing and information retrieval. Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
