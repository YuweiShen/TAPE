The concept of popular matchings is also relevant to social choice theory (cs.DM). The paper proposes a new subclass of popular matchings called dominant matchings, which is a novel contribution to the field and may be of interest to researchers in data structures (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
