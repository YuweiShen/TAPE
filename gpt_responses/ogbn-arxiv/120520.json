The paper proposes a novel algorithmic pipeline based on nonconvex optimization with a spherical constraint, which is naturally phrased in the language of manifold optimization. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), scientific computing (cs.SI), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
