The paper also involves transfer learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for classification suggests the possibility of research in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves the creation and evaluation of a dataset, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
