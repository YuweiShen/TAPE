Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves graph theory and combinatorics, which are covered by cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DM (Combinatorics). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of c-planarity, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
