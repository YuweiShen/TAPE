Therefore, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) is a likely sub-category. The paper also uses techniques from information theory and computational complexity, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the study of algorithms and data structures for efficiently computing matching families, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves some analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the size of matching families as the parameters of the finite field are varied, which suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
