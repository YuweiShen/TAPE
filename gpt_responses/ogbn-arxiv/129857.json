The use of error-correcting codes is a central theme of the paper, which suggests that it may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of the decoding algorithm, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and could potentially place it in the sub-category of sparse recovery (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
