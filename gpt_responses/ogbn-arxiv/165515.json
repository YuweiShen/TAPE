The use of finite-state channels and Markovian channels suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). The use of block codes and universal decoders suggests a networking and internet architecture perspective (cs.NI). The use of capacity results suggests a machine learning perspective (cs.LG). Finally, the use of memoryless channels suggests a multimedia perspective (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
