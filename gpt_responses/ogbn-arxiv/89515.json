The paper also proposes the use of neural networks for sensor data fusion, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper introduces a new training method for neural networks, which is related to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
