The paper also derives a closed-form expression for the average throughput of the proposed protocol. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory sub-category. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper investigates a WPCN setup with one multi-antenna access point (AP) and one single-antenna source. The paper proposes a protocol for the considered WPCN and characterizes its performance. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) setup and proposes a protocol for energy accumulation and information transmission. The paper also models the energy accumulation process at the source battery using a discrete Markov chain. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Systems and Control sub-category. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper investigates a wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) setup with one multi-antenna access point (AP) and one single-antenna source. The paper proposes a protocol for the considered WPCN and characterizes its performance. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Multimedia sub-category. \n"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
