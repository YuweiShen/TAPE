The paper also presents analyses of the proposed technique. Given these characteristics, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
