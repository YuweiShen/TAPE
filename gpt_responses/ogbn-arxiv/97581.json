The markers are obtained as color images synthesized by a deep network from input bit strings, and another deep network is trained to recover the bit strings back from the photos of these markers. This involves photometric and geometric distortions associated with marker fabrication and marker scanning, which are characteristic of computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) research. The use of deep generative networks also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the experiments involve demonstrating the ability to combine information encoding with artistic stylization, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
