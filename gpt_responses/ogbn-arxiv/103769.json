This topic falls under the category of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper proposes a general framework that learns to discriminate between global and local noises in the external information, which requires machine learning techniques and could potentially involve deep learning models. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various neural architectures, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could be another relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on real-world scenarios, which could involve image or video captioning tasks, and therefore cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) could also be a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
