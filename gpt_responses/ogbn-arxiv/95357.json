It specifically focuses on sponsored search auctions (cs.IR) and online ad-exchanges, which involve the allocation of digital goods and the optimization of revenue/efficiency (cs.EC). The paper also mentions the use of linear programming to identify optimal probability distributions, which is a common technique in optimization and algorithms research (cs.DS).
