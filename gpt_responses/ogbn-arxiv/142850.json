The paper also introduces a language for describing the different formats and a query language for extracting statistics about sparse tensors, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses an abstract interface for assembling data structures efficiently, which could be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
