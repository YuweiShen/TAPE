This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The proposed method involves processing of signals to detect OFDM signals from sub-Nyquist samples. This falls under the domain of signal processing.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Spectrum sensing is an important aspect of cognitive radio networks, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses statistical properties of sample covariance matrix to derive an approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for detection of OFDM signals. This involves the use of statistical learning techniques.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): OFDM signals are commonly used in multimedia applications such as digital TV and radio broadcasting. The proposed method for spectrum sensing of OFDM signals from sub-Nyquist samples can be applied in such multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
