It also involves the study of the Tanner graph for codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The examination of simple ways of constructing codes from other codes and the analysis of their stopping redundancy may fall under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The study of the stopping redundancy of codes may also have applications in network information theory (cs.SI) and network coding (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
