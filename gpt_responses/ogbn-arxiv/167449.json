Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of deep learning models, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions hand-drawn sketches, which could indicate that it belongs to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
