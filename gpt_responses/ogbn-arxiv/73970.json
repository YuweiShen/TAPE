This makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on continuous control benchmarks, indicating a potential fit for the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of reinforcement learning suggests a potential fit for the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
