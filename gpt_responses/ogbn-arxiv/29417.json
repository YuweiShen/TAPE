The paper proposes an algorithm that uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to address the problem of latent confounders in contextual bandits. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
