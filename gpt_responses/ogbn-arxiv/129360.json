This task falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The proposed approach also involves regularization and weighting, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses the challenge of partial occlusion, which is a common problem in computer vision and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
