The paper also proposes several neural network models leveraging attention mechanisms and embeddings, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with ranking object values for a given subject-predicate combination, which is a task related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and possibly social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
