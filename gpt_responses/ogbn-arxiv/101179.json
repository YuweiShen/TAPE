The paper proposes a novel method called Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) to improve the generalization of adversarial training. This work involves both computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) techniques, and it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing adversarial training approaches and proposes a new method to address these limitations, which could be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that the proposed method could be relevant to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
