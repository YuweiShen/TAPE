This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with analyzing optimization progress, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new theorem, which could make it relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
