This involves joint optimization of baseband fronthaul compression and baseband signal processing under different PHY functional splits. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses information-theoretical arguments to analyze the optimal functional split between RRHs and BBU for uplink channel estimation and downlink precoding in C-RANs. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the fronthaul connectivity between RRHs and BBU in C-RANs, which is a key aspect of network architecture and requires efficient networking and internet architecture solutions. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves joint optimization of baseband fronthaul compression and baseband signal processing, which can be seen as a control problem in C-RANs. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with signal processing challenges in C-RANs, which are relevant to multimedia applications that require high-capacity and low-latency fr"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
