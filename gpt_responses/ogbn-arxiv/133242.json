The authors use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the performance of the classifiers. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the performance of different classifiers and builds an ensemble of classifiers to improve the accuracy. The authors also use PCA to reduce overfitting, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses machine learning techniques to improve the performance of classifiers on the CIFAR-10 dataset. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the performance of different classifiers and builds an ensemble of classifiers, which involves designing and implementing algorithms to combine the classifiers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
