The paper proposes a modular attention mechanism that is implemented in neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed mechanism involves updating and rectifying the output likelihood distribution, which is a characteristic of neural networks that use optimization algorithms such as backpropagation, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed mechanism on various datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
