The paper also discusses the use of heuristics and the NP-hardness of the problem, which are common themes in the field of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS). The paper introduces a temporal approach to building social networks, which involves the use of time windows and forgetting mechanisms, which are techniques commonly used in the field of data mining and machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of node structural measures like degree and betweenness, which are common concepts in the field of network science (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on real datasets, which is a typical approach in the field of data science (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
