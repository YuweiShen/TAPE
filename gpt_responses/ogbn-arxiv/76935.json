However, the paper also mentions that the transform can be computed in linear time and consuming linear storage, which suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results indicating that their variant of the transform gives better compression ratio than the original Burrows-Wheeler transform, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
