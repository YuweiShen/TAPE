Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization problems, which can be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the achievable system throughput and spectrum efficiency, which can be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
