The paper also mentions solving design problems for large-scale component systems, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) or distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper's focus on reconciling different views of a system could also be relevant to the field of deep learning (cs.DL), where models often involve multiple layers and perspectives."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
