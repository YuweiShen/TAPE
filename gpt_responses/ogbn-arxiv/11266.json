The paper also discusses the use of cost-sensitive classification methods, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the approach is done in terms of expected cost, which is a metric commonly used in network intrusion detection (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different classification models, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
