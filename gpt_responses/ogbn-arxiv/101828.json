The paper also uses the Group Shapley value, which is a concept from cooperative game theory, and hence can be categorized under cs.GT. The problem of influence maximization is a well-studied problem in computer science, and the paper provides hardness of approximation results, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.DS). The paper also deals with the spread of information in a social network, which is a topic in social computing (cs.SOC). Finally, the paper proposes a greedy algorithm to solve the problem, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
