This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning. \n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of mobile health technologies to generate positive influence on people's health, which is a topic related to the intersection of computers and society. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a network cohesion constrained RL method for mHealth, which involves learning policies based on the similarity of users and their behaviors. This falls under the domain of social and information networks. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the use of mobile health technologies to provide health guides to device users, which is a topic related to human-computer interaction. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for optimizing policies in mHealth interventions, which involves controlling the behavior of the system (i.e. the users) to achieve a desired outcome.
