This falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) since MDPs are commonly used in reinforcement learning. The paper also discusses the use of model order reduction and space discretization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems, which falls under the category of mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
