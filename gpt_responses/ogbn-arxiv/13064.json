The proposed method involves training a model using predictive coding, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using mutual information to maximize the similarity between normal and noisy skeletons, which is a concept from information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper uses datasets commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
