This problem is related to the field of information theory, which deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a non-convex optimization algorithm based on projected gradient descent to solve the blind calibration problem. This algorithm can be seen as a machine learning method for estimating the unknown gains of the random sensing vectors. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The blind calibration problem is a common issue in computer vision applications, where it is necessary to calibrate the camera or sensor parameters to obtain accurate measurements. The proposed method can be applied to solve this problem in a computationally efficient way. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of recovering an unknown signal from noisy measurements, which is a common issue in social and information networks. The proposed method can be used to estimate the unknown gains of the sensing vectors in a networked sensing system. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper proposes an optimization algorithm based on projected gradient descent to solve the blind calibration problem.
