Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of information and communication. The paper also involves network capacities and multi-user scenarios, which are related to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The investigation of channel behavior and performance evaluation can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control), while the use of arrays and antenna ports can be related to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves channel measurements and evaluation, which can be categorized under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
