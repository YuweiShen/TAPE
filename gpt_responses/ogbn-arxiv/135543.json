Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes an ensemble algorithm, which involves combining multiple models, suggesting that it may be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of data to improve default box selection may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the application of the improved algorithm to construction sites suggests that it may be relevant to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
