The paper uses a policy-based agent with continuous states based on knowledge graph embeddings, which reasons in a KG vector space by sampling the most promising relation to extend its path. This work involves machine learning, natural language processing, and database systems, which are all covered by the above-mentioned sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.DB, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
