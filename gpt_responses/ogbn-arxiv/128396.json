This involves techniques for synchronization, detection, and estimation, which are all related to information theory and communication systems (cs.IT, cs.COMM). The use of up-sampling, matched filtering, and differential correlation approach at the receiver also suggests a focus on digital signal processing and data structures (cs.DS). The proposed techniques are also well-suited for software implementation, indicating a potential interest in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with the performance analysis of the proposed techniques, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
