The use of neural networks and large-scale graph learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation tasks mentioned, such as image classification and triplet ranking, are common in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the effectiveness of image retrieval based on the proposed method, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves capturing semantics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
