This involves extending regular grid CNN to irregular point configuration by generalizing a convolution operator, which holds the permutation invariance of points, and achieving efficient inductive learning of local patterns. The paper also finds inspiration from dense connection mode, to repeatedly aggregate multi-level and multi-scale semantics in a deep hierarchy. Given these technical details, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with geometric reasoning (cs.GR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) to some extent, but these are less likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
