This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-disciplines, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), communication and security (cs.COMM), optics and photonics (cs.OH), and signal processing (cs.SP). Given the focus on wireless communication and modulation techniques, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories. However, the paper also discusses the technical properties of optical signals and their transmission, which suggests cs.OH and cs.PHOTONICS as possible categories. Finally, the paper's emphasis on performance evaluation and comparison with other techniques suggests cs.COMM as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
