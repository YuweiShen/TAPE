The paper proposes a new approach to bridge the gap between the architecture and high-level specifications of DNNs, which is related to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the theoretical foundations of the proposed approach, which is related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed approach through various experiments, which is related to the field of computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
