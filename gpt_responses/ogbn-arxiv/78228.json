This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as generating intermediate code strings and matching them with pronunciations of input text. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, as it involves matching input text with pronunciations. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, as it uses a scheme to generate intermediate code strings. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with inputting text on computers, which involves human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques.
