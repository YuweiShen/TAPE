This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the sum-rate-distortion function, which is a concept commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also leverages convex-geometric properties, which is a topic in both data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
