Additionally, the use of histogram statistics, representational dissimilarity matrix, and class activation mapping to observe the selective and invariance representations of DCNN in HRRS image recognition are common techniques used in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also involves training a deep neural network (AlexNet) on a large-scale remote sensing image recognition benchmark, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on understanding the effective feature representation of DCNN in remote sensing images tasks, such as classification, detection, and segment, suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe use of deep neural networks and their properties in remote sensing image recognition also suggests that the paper could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of visual stimulation-characteristic response combined with feature coding-classification decoding suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category, which involves the analysis and retrieval of information from large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
