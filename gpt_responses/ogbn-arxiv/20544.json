This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of uncertainty maps and facial keypoints also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (cs.MM) and the evaluation of results on challenging benchmarks (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
