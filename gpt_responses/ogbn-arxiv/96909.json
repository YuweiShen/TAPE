The paper also discusses constructing a hypothesis space using weak classifiers, which is a common technique in computer vision (\"cs.CV\") and artificial intelligence (\"cs.AI\"). The use of Kullback-Leibler divergence and empirical performance measurement suggests a focus on statistical theory and analysis, which could also place the paper in the categories of \"cs.ST\" (Statistics) or \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
