The proposed construction of polar lattices involves quantization, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The nesting structure of polar lattices also provides solutions for multi-terminal coding problems, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for achieving the rate-distortion bound, which is a fundamental concept in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
