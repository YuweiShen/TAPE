This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme can be applied to wireless communication systems, which is a sub-domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the computational complexity and required hardware complexity reduction of the proposed scheme, which falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme can be used for multimedia transmission in wireless communication systems.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the computational complexity reduction of the proposed scheme, which falls under the domain of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
