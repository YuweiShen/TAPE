Additionally, the use of distorted images and limiting display time to 100ms suggests a focus on early visual processing, which is a common topic in the cs.CV field. \n\nThe paper also touches on neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it compares the performance of the human visual system with state-of-the-art deep neural networks. \n\nFurthermore, the paper's focus on performance evaluation and comparison suggests a potential fit for the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. \n\nFinally, the paper's consideration of the limitations of the human visual system and potential implications for future research suggests a potential fit for the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
