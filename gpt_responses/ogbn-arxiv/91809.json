The paper proposes a novel training paradigm that involves cooperative training of a single convolutional neural network on both RGB visual features and depth features, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves deep aggregation of features, which is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
