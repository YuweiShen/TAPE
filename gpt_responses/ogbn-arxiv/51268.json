The proposed weakly linear disjunctive datalog language and its application to ontology reasoning suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational logic (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a tractable extension of OWL 2 RL with disjunctive axioms, which is a topic in computational reasoning (cs.CR). Finally, the paper's empirical results suggest that query answering over weakly linear programs is feasible in practice, which is relevant to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
