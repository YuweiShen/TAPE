The use of machine learning models for recognition of social domains and relations suggests a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning (cs.AI) as well. The paper also discusses the use of social psychology theory, which could be categorized under social and information sciences (cs.SI). The focus on interpretability of features suggests a focus on machine learning and data mining (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of a dataset composed of visual data suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
