Additionally, the paper proposes a method that employs non-linear mappings combined with cross-view discriminative subspace learning and cross-view distance metric learning based on pairwise similarity constraints, which are common techniques used in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques such as kernel methods, which are commonly used in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). \n\nThe paper's focus on handling small size training data suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with the processing and analysis of multimedia data, including images and videos. \n\nThe use of pairwise similarity constraints in the proposed method suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category, which deals with the development of intelligent agents and systems that can learn from data. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of person re-identification systems suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR), which deals with the development of secure systems and protocols for protecting sensitive information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
