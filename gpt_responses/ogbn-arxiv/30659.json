This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the concept of pre-expansivity, which is related to the information content of pairs of configurations in cellular automata. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the properties of cellular automata, which can be seen as logical systems. The concept of pre-expansivity can also be seen as a logical property.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the behavior of cellular automata, which can be seen as dynamical systems. The concept of pre-expansivity can be seen as a property of the dynamics of cellular automata.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of cellular automata, specifically in terms of their expansivity and pre-expansivity properties. This falls under the scope of computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
