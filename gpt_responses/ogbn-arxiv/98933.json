This topic falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the evolution from two-user to multi-user cognitive interference channels, which involves network communication and networking (cs.NI). The paper proposes novel capacity inner and outer bounds, which involves signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the role of a global cognitive user in managing interference in the network, which involves computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
