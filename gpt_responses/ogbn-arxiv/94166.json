The paper also introduces a novel approach called Forward-Backward Pursuit (FBP), which is a type of iterative algorithm that falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also includes simulations for the recovery of a sparse image, which falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category.
