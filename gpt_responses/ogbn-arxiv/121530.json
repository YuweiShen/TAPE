This is a central topic in computational complexity theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper studies the query complexity of computing Boolean functions, which is a fundamental problem in data structures and algorithms. The use of quantum subroutines adds a new twist to this problem.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses information-theoretic techniques to derive lower bounds on the hybrid query complexity of Boolean functions. This is a common approach in information theory.\n- cs.QI (Quantum Physics): The paper uses quantum subroutines to speed up the computation of Boolean functions, and analyzes the resulting hybrid decision trees. This is a central topic in quantum information theory.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the conjecture that an exponential separation exists between classical and quantum query complexity for certain Boolean functions, which has implications for cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
