The paper proposes a systematic two-stage approach for detecting false data injection attacks, which involves monitoring abnormal load deviations and suspicious branch flow changes. This approach involves the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and network intelligence (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of state estimation in energy management systems, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a method for improving operator situation awareness in real-time, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
