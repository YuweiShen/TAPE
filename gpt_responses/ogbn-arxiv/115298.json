The paper also addresses the practical constraint of a maximum permitted power level radiated by each antenna, which is a constraint commonly encountered in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper proposes a solution to optimize the system in a maximum fairness sense, which is a problem in optimization and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). The paper also investigates the implications of the novel constraints via prominent applications and paradigms, which is a problem in systems and control (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
