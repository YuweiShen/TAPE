The paper also discusses efficient correlators, which are commonly used in information theory applications. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a new construction for complementary sets and complete complementary codes, which are commonly used in signal processing applications. The paper also discusses polyphase and QAM sets, which are signal processing techniques. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new generator for complementary sets, which involves constructing a specific data structure. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses hexagonal PU sets, which are used in machine learning applications such as image recognition. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses QAM sets, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as digital television and satellite communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
