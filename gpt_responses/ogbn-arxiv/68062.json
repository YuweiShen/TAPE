The paper also mentions the use of auto-encoders, which are a type of deep learning model (cs.LG, cs.DL). The task of document image binarization is also related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed approach compared to existing strategies, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence research (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
