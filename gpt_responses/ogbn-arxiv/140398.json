This suggests that the paper is likely to fall under the categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of a novel CTP-based programming language, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL).
