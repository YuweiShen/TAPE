The paper also formulates a non-convex optimization problem to minimize the error rate with a fixed spectral efficiency. These aspects are related to information theory and signal processing, making cs.IT the most likely category.\n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a communication system using visible light, which is a type of wireless communication. The paper also considers practical illumination constraints, which are related to the deployment of VLC systems in real-world scenarios. These aspects are related to networking and internet architecture, making cs.COMM a likely category.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Similar to the previous category, the paper deals with the design of a communication system using visible light and considers practical illumination constraints. These aspects are also related to networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI a likely category.\n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper proposes a new modulation scheme for VLC system using RGB LED, which involves joint utilization of different optical wavelengths, multiple baseband subcarriers, and adaptive DC-bias. These aspects are not specific to any particular sub-category of computer"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
