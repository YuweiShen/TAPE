The paper also discusses wireless communication channels, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of Marton coding and Gaussian input distribution suggests that the paper may also be relevant to source coding (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of results to more than two channel components, which could be related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
