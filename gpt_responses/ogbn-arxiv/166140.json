This suggests a strong connection to logic in computer science.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the modelling of software architectures with quantitative characteristics, which is a key aspect of software engineering.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the modelling of component-based systems, which is a key aspect of programming languages.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the modelling of systems with multiple components that are connected via their interfaces, which suggests a connection to distributed computing.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the modelling of synchronous applications, which suggests a connection to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
