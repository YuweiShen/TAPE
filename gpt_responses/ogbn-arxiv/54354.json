The paper proposes a novel interactive attention model for semantic text matching, which involves learning new representations for source and target texts through interactive attention via global matching matrix and updates local fine-grained relevance between source and target. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category is focused on the intersection of computer science and linguistics, which includes topics such as natural language processing, computational linguistics, and speech processing. The problem of semantic text matching is highly relevant to this sub-category, as it involves understanding and processing natural language text. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category is focused on the retrieval of information from large collections of data, such as text documents. Semantic text matching is a key problem in information retrieval, as it involves matching a target text to a source text in order to retrieve relevant information. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category is focused on the development of intelligent agents and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language understanding and reasoning. The problem of semantic text matching is relevant to this sub-category, as it involves developing models that can understand and reason about natural language text. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning):"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
