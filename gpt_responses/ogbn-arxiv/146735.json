It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a family of similarity measures. The paper also mentions natural language processing (cs.CL) as a potential application of the proposed measures. Cybersecurity (cs.CR) is another possible sub-category as the paper discusses the impact of algorithmic changes on search results. Finally, Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) could be a relevant sub-category as the paper presents solutions for optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
