The use of biologically inspired architectures also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The evaluation of the approach on the Atari suite suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV), and the use of second order optimization and wavelet scattering suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
