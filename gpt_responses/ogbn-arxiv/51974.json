The paper also discusses the use of different loss functions for training these networks, which is a topic within machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper explores the effect of training objective on image encoding and analyzes conditions under which perceptually-optimized representations yield better performance on image classification, which are topics within artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper demonstrates the superiority of perceptually-optimized networks for super-resolution imaging, which is a topic within multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
