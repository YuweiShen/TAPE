The aggregation of individual approvals of voters can be modeled as a game where each voter is a player and the committee formation is the outcome of the game. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new aggregation rule for committee selection with attribute approval. This involves designing an algorithm that can efficiently aggregate the individual approvals of voters. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses different aggregation techniques proposed in the literature and analyzes their properties. This involves studying the computational complexity of these techniques and their suitability for different scenarios. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of committee formation, which is a social network problem. The preferences of voters are based on their opinion on candidate suitability, which can be influenced by their social network. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new aggregation rule that satisfies Unanimity and Justified Representation when attribute based approvals are considered. This involves designing a learning algorithm that can learn from the individual approvals of voters and arrive at the optimal committee."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
