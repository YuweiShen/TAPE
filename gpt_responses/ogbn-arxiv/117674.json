This topic falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the difficulty in defining the quality of datasets, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses the MNIST dataset as an example, which is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
