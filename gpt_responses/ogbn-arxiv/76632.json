The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper proposes different utility functions to optimize the allocation, which can be considered as a machine learning approach (cs.LG). Finally, the paper assumes perfect channel knowledge, which is a common assumption in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
