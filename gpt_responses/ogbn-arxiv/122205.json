The paper also proposes a novel framework that learns an accurate execution time model for deep neural networks and informs a compression algorithm to minimize execution time without impacting accuracy, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework using three different sensing-related tasks, which could fall under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
