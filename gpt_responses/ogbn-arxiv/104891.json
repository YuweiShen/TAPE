Additionally, the paper proposes a novel financial AI visualization framework for deep learning-driven stock market prediction, which involves the use of various machine learning techniques such as attention mechanisms and class-enhanced response maps. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of computer vision techniques for visualizing and explaining the decisions made by deep learning models, which suggests the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). Furthermore, the paper involves the use of information retrieval techniques for analyzing the decision-making process of deep learning models, which suggests the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves the application of deep learning to the financial industry, which suggests the sub-category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
