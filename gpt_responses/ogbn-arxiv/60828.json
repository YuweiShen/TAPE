The use of the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) for testing the discriminability of visualizations suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the ranking of competing encodings and selecting visualizations, which could involve machine learning (cs.AI) and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
