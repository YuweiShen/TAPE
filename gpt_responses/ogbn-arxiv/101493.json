Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses automatic annotation of speakers, which falls under the category of cs.SD (Sound). Additionally, the paper uses deep neural networks for training, which is related to cs.SI (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of limited annotated data, which is related to cs.LG (Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a language recognition system, which is related to cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
