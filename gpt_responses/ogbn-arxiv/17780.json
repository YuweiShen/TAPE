Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The use of neural networks for feature extraction and classification suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.SD (Sound), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses dataset augmentation, which is a common technique in computer vision, suggesting that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision).
