Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the complexities of state-of-the-art CNNs and their optimization, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of IoT and automation in agriculture makes cs.IOT (Internet of Things) a likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a classification taxonomy, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper discusses the development of deep learning tools for agriculture, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
