This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video stabilization, which is a multimedia-related task. Hence, cs.MM is also a likely category.\n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper formulates an optimization problem to find a virtual camera pose that retains smooth rotation and translation transitions across frames. This involves graphics-related concepts, making cs.GR a possible category.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on stabilizing selfie videos, which is a task that involves human-computer interaction. Hence, cs.HC is also a possible category.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions that the proposed method is robust to different kinds of camera motions. This involves concepts related to robotics, making cs.RO a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
