The use of linkage construction involves graph theory and combinatorics, which are also relevant to computer science. Therefore, cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.DM (discrete mathematics), and cs.CC (computational complexity) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of subspace codes, which could fall under cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
