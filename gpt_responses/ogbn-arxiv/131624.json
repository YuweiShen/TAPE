The paper specifically focuses on one data selection approach called Feature Decay Algorithms (FDA) and proposes the use of an approximated target-side in addition to the source-side when selecting suitable sentence-pairs for training a model. Given this focus on NMT and data selection, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
