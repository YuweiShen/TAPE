Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of limited workspace, which suggests that it may be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the time and space complexity of the algorithms, which could fall under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
