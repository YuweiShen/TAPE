The method involves learning the labels of unlabelled data directly and works in a discriminative manner without suffering from overfitting. The empirical studies involve datasets related to computer vision (MNIST, Caltech-256, and ImageNet) and cybersecurity (KDD99), indicating that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cybersecurity (cs.CR), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
