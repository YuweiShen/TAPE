This falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a new loss function for training these models, which involves optimization and objective functions, making it relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on standard benchmark datasets, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
