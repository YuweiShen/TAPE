The paper also proposes a new model for generating multiple plausible future trajectories, which involves designing convolutional RNNs over graphs, a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques for annotating the dataset, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a 3D simulator for creating the dataset, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
