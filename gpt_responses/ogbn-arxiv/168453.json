It also reviews parallel CHR implementations in software and hardware. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions multisets of constraints that are transformed by CHR rules, which can be seen as a data structure. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of CHR for implementing and reasoning with models for concurrency, which can be seen as a software engineering task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
