This falls under the category of networked systems and technologies, which is covered by cs.NI (Networked Systems). The paper also discusses the use of augmented reality and holoportation, which falls under the category of computer graphics and virtual reality, covered by cs.AR (Computer Graphics). The paper also discusses the need to efficiently harness recent technological advances, which falls under the category of software engineering, covered by cs.SD (Software Engineering). The paper also discusses the limitations of the current network architecture and protocols, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing, covered by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the need for reliable and secure communication protocols, which falls under the category of information theory, covered by cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
