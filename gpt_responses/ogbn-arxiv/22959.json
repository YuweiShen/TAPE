It also uses machine learning techniques to estimate power consumption based on resource utilization, which falls under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Additionally, the paper involves regression analysis, which is a common technique in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of its findings, which could fall under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
