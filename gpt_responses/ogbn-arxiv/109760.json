The use of object representations also involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) as it requires identifying and manipulating objects in an environment. Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of these representations on generalization, which is a key aspect of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
