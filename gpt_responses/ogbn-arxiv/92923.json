The use of stochastic geometry to model the system also suggests a possible category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the benefits of pilot reuse on cell-throughput and user-rate, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT) in terms of optimizing system performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
