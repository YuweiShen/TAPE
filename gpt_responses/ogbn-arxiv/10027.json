The proposed approach involves constructing a hierarchy of abstractions, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG, cs.RO). The paper also mentions applications such as navigation and planning under uncertainty, which are relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves computational methods for solving large-scale problems, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
