This is a common problem in computer vision, and the proposed method is based on generative adversarial networks, which are widely used in computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method based on generative adversarial networks, which is a popular machine learning technique. The method learns to discover relations between different domains given unpaired data, which is a challenging problem in machine learning.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for discovering cross-domain relations, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The proposed method is based on generative adversarial networks, which are widely used in artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on transferring style between different domains, which is a common problem in multimedia. The proposed method is based on generative adversarial networks, which are widely used in multimedia.\n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a method based on generative adversarial networks, which is a popular neural computing technique.
