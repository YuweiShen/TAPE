The use of Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) also involves control and optimization of network functions, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The proposed routing scheme and optimization methods involve computational complexity and algorithm design, which are relevant to computer science theory (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
