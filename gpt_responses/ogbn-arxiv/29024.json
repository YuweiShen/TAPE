Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR. The paper also mentions the use of neural models and learning-to-rank frameworks, which are common in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) research. This suggests that cs.CL and cs.LG are also likely categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multiple fields and passage retrieval, which are relevant to computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL) research, respectively. Therefore, cs.CV and cs.DL are also possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
