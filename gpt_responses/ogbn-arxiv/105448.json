The paper also focuses on the design of storage systems (cs.DS) and the use of network protocols (cs.NI) to optimize the repair bandwidth. Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical characterization of the tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth, which falls under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
