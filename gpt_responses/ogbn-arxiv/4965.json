The scheme is based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, which involves algebraic geometry and number theory, suggesting that it could also fit into the cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The extension of the scheme to supersingular abelian surfaces involves more advanced algebraic geometry, which could place it in the cs.CY (Computational Geometry) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a specific implementation of the scheme using genus 2 supersingular isogenies, which could be relevant to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
