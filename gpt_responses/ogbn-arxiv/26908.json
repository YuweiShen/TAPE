The paper also discusses the use of different classifiers to construct a predictive model, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed classifier fusion strategy involves the use of analytic evidential reasoning, which is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with medical imaging, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
