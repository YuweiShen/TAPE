The use of RGB-D sensors and OpenPose algorithm for human skeleton estimation suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the importance of safety standards and risk assessment, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a framework for separation distance monitoring, which is directly related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
