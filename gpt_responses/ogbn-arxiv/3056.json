The method involves selecting a smaller number of deformation modes, which can be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction, and thus relates to machine learning (cs.MM) and computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions a global optimization step, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
