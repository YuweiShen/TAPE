Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a fully learning-based approach, which suggests that it may fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with multi-person pose estimation, which may fall under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves the use of camera distance-aware techniques, which suggests that it may fall under the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
