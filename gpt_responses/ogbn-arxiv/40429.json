The proposed method also involves quality-aware feature aggregation, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of multimodal data (RGB-T) suggests that this paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
