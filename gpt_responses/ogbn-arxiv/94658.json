This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for learning a policy using observational data and a learned model of the environment dynamics. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses a large-scale observational dataset of driving behavior recorded from traffic cameras. This falls under the domain of computer vision, specifically object detection and tracking. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a method for learning a policy for driving in dense traffic. This falls under the domain of robotics, specifically autonomous driving. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for learning a policy for driving in dense traffic using a learned model of the environment dynamics. This falls under the domain of systems and control, specifically model predictive control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
