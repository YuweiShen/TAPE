The use of LP-rounding algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT). The problem of maximizing the expected weight of the matching in the presence of uncertainty and limited queries can be seen as a problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the use of approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
