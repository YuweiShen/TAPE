The system is designed to be accessible to non-experts, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper mentions the system's potential for broadening education access, indicating a possible connection to computer science education (cs.EDU). Finally, the use of modern web technologies suggests a potential overlap with natural language processing (cs.CL) in terms of web-based interfaces and user interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
