The paper also discusses practical applications and deployment in industrial settings, which suggests a focus on systems and information retrieval (cs.SI). Finally, the paper describes experiments confirming the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
