The paper also discusses nonparametric approaches, which are often used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves a filtering procedure, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also deals with natural language processing, as it discusses the labeling of images (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses benchmark datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia and computer vision research (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
