Specifically, the paper proposes a new algorithm for pruning (sparsifying) trained neural networks in a layer-wise manner. This algorithm is based on solving a convex optimization program and is applicable to networks that use the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the nonlinear activation. Given this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
