The proposed framework involves formulating an intrinsic objective as the mutual information between the goal states and the controllable states, which encourages the agent to take control of its environment. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new framework for reinforcement learning, which involves formulating an intrinsic objective and deriving a surrogate objective that can be optimized efficiently. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to reinforcement learning that is motivated by the observation that intelligent organisms learn from internal drives. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper evaluates the developed framework in different robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision or pattern recognition, but the evaluation of the developed framework in different robotic manipulation and navigation tasks may involve visual perception. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition sub-category. \n- cs.SY"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
