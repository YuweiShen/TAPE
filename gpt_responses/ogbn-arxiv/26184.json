Additionally, the paper introduces a formal model of resilience in X10, which is relevant to distributed computing. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses mutable objects on the heap, which are a fundamental data structure in programming. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the behavior of concurrent, multi-place X10 programs, which is relevant to software engineering. Additionally, the paper introduces principles that permit an X10 programmer to write clean code that continues to work in the presence of place failure, which is relevant to software engineering. \n- cs.LOPLAS (Logic and Verification): The paper mentions that the given semantics have been mechanized in Coq, which is a proof assistant that is often used for logic and verification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
