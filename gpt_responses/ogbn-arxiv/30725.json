The paper also uses techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and probability theory (cs.PR). The paper's abstract mentions the use of small ball estimates and chaining techniques, which are commonly used in statistical learning theory (cs.LG) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper's title mentions \"improved bounds,\" which suggests that the paper is building upon existing results in the field, indicating that it may belong to the sub-categories of numerical analysis (cs.NA) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
