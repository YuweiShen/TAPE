The use of conditional constraints and the complexity analysis suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the application of the techniques to conditional constraint trees suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
