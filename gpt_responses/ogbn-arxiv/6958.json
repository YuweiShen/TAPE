This problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry and has applications in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, and wireless sensor networks. The paper proposes a novel approach based on distance distribution matching and constrained nonconvex optimization. This approach is different from conventional greedy build-up approaches and is robust to noise. The paper also discusses several initialization strategies and provides numerical experiments to substantiate the claims. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
