This involves utilizing redundancy in the Rx-Xmit plane to interpolate missing data. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image processing and analysis. The paper also involves the use of deep learning algorithms, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with ultrasound imaging systems.
