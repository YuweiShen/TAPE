This paper deals with natural language processing and information retrieval tasks related to argumentation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The use of ranking algorithms and feature engineering for information retrieval tasks points towards cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the study of argument types and their impact on the detection task may also relate to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
