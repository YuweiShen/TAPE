The use of load-balancing theory suggests that it could also fall under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a self-randomized modulation code, which could be related to error-correcting codes (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
