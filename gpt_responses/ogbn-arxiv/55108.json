Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization and cooperation among mobile edge nodes, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper mentions cache hit rate and traffic load, which are related to information theory and multimedia systems, respectively, and could be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
