It could also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category as it proposes a defense approach to mitigate the threat. Additionally, it involves real-time streaming and detection, which could place it in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) category. The paper also deals with the timely verification and mitigation of incidents, which could place it in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. Finally, the paper discusses privacy and flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, which could place it in the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
