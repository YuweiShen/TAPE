The paper also investigates the impact of error propagation in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, which involves machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI a likely category as well. The use of BERT models also involves deep learning (DL) and large-scale machine learning (LSML), making cs.LG a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with biomedical data, which could fall under the category of computational biology (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
