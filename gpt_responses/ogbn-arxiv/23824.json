The paper also proposes algorithms for pre-computation of skyline results, which involves dynamic programming and greedy heuristics, and this falls under the data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper focuses on the encrypted setting, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
