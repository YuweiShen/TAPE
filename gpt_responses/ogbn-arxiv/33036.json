This topic falls under the intersection of coding theory, information theory, and quantum computing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves algebraic geometry and group theory, which are relevant to cs.GT (Computational Geometry). Additionally, the paper discusses the construction of MDS codes, which is a topic in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves computational methods and algorithms, which are relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SD (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
