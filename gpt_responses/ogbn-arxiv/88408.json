This involves compressive sensing techniques and information theory (cs.IT), computer vision (cs.CV), and multimedia (cs.MM) to achieve high-resolution imaging at video rate. The paper also discusses the optical architecture underlying LiSens, which falls under optics (cs.OH) and signal processing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
