The use of a neural estimator (MINE) and matrix exponential for transformation matrix computation suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves information theory, specifically mutual information, which could place it under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the use of a neural estimator suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
