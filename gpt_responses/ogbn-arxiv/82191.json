Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of reliable communication and information processing. The paper also involves the design of nonorthogonal pilot signals, which is related to the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of spatially common sparsity and distributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm suggests the category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also deals with the performance analysis of the proposed scheme, which falls under the category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the closed-loop channel tracking scheme and the Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis suggest the category cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
