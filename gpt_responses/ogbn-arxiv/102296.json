It also mentions the application of the problem to multi-view video coding (cs.MM) and wireless sensor networks (cs.NI). The paper uses analytical tools and ideas from the recent information-theoretic streaming literature, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
