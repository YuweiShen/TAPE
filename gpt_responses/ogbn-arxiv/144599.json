Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of low bit-width weights and activations, which is related to optimization and hardware implementation, suggesting that it could also fit into cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper proposes a method for efficient computation, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
