The proposed approach involves network architecture search and pruning, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a hybrid criterion for network pruning, which involves data-driven decision making and can be considered as an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
