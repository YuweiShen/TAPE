The paper also proposes an algorithmic framework for NLOS imaging, which is a key area of research in computer vision.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the use of time-resolved computational imaging systems for NLOS imaging, which involves the use of graphics techniques to model the light transport in the scene.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions the potential applications of NLOS imaging in navigation and mapping capabilities of autonomous vehicles, which is a key area of research in robotics.\n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper discusses the use of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based acquisition system for NLOS imaging, which is a novel technology that may not fit neatly into any specific sub-category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the limitations of existing NLOS reconstruction algorithms in handling partial occlusions within the hidden scenes, which is a problem that can be addressed using information theory techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
