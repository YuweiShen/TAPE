It could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category as it discusses the impact of function approximation and off-policy learning on the agent's performance. The paper also touches upon robotics (cs.RO) as reinforcement learning is often used in robotics applications. The system-level analysis of the components of the deep Q-networks could also place this paper in the systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the use of neural networks in the deep Q-networks could place this paper in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
