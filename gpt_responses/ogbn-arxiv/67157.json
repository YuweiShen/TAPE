The paper also discusses performance bounds and mathematical results, indicating a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The lingering effect and its impact on performance can be seen as a system dynamics problem, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the simulation experiments suggest a focus on machine learning and data analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
