The paper also discusses the use of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a new search space representation, which could potentially fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
