The paper also introduces a new concept of Condensed Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) and develops a suite of protocols that offer desirable statistical utility while preserving privacy, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with different types of client data, ranging from ordinal data types in finite metric spaces to non-ordinal items and sequences of ordinal and non-ordinal items, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.DB (Databases) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper presents case studies with Symantec datasets, which further supports its potential classification under the sub-category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
