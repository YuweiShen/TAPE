The proposed approach involves learning unified binary codes through a fusion hash network, which is a common technique in computer vision.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Cross-modal retrieval is a task in information retrieval, and the paper proposes a novel approach for this task. The approach involves learning high-quality unified hash codes that can be used to encode out-of-sample queries.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): Cross-modal retrieval is a common task in multimedia, and the paper proposes a novel approach for this task. The approach involves learning unified binary codes that can be used to encode heterogeneous multi-modal data.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning approach for cross-modal retrieval, which involves learning unified binary codes through a fusion hash network. The approach also involves supervising the training of modality-specific hash networks using high-quality unified hash codes.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves learning unified binary codes that can be used to encode semantic information. The approach involves embedding both pair-wise similarity information and classification information in the hash networks, which preserves cross-modal similarity and keeps semantic consistency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
