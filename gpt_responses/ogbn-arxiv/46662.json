The paper focuses on the impact of multiple status changes in primary user traffic on the sensing performance, which is a key issue in cognitive radio networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper involves the analysis of network traffic, signal processing, and machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
