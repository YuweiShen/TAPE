This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The approach also involves encryption and obscuring traffic side-channels, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions using machine learning to detect side-channel attacks, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
