The use of visual odometry also suggests a robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The fusion moves technique used for combining flow proposals could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the method on challenging sequences could be related to graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
