Information theory is closely related to the design and analysis of communication systems, which is the main focus of this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new scheme for mmWave communication systems, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme can efficiently exploit the potential multi-user diversity, which is important for multimedia applications that require high data rates and low latency.\n4. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper focuses on the design and analysis of a communication system, which falls under the scope of communications and networking.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The resource allocation problem studied in the paper involves designing a suboptimal two-stage algorithm for maximizing the system sum-rate, which can be viewed as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
