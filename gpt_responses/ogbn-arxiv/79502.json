The use of spatial coupling, which involves the coupling of multiple copies of the same code, is a recent development in the field and has been studied in the statistical physics (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The lecture also discusses the use of belief propagation decoding on graphs with certain properties, which falls under the network science (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
