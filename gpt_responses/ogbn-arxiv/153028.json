The paper also involves mathematical modeling and analysis of the jamming schemes, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes the use of reinforcement learning algorithms, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves experimental evaluation on a testbed, which could also fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
