The paper also discusses algorithms for computing the Alternating Burrows-Wheeler Transform, which falls under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of compressed full text indices, which is a topic studied in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the transform, which are topics studied in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
