The use of an additional variable to achieve averaging is a common technique in control theory, and the paper's focus on time-varying topologies is also relevant to this sub-category. \n2. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper's main focus is on multi-agent consensus, which is a core topic in this sub-category. The use of surplus-based algorithms is also relevant to this sub-category. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The problem of multi-agent consensus is a distributed computing problem, and the paper's focus on time-varying topologies is also relevant to this sub-category. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of consensus on digraphs, which are a type of network structure. The paper's focus on time-varying topologies is also relevant to this sub-category. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The problem of multi-agent consensus is also relevant to this sub-category, as it is a common problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning and other AI applications. The use of surplus-based algorithms may also be of interest to researchers in this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
