The paper also discusses the use of neural architecture search (NAS), which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves optimizing the computational cost and accuracy trade-off, which could fall under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on multiple detection datasets, which could fall under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
