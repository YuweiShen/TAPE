This involves learning a neural score function and a dynamics model from sparse reward interactions, which can be used for planning on unseen tasks in a zero-shot condition. The paper covers a wide range of applications including gridworld, robotics tasks, and video games, indicating that it could fall under several sub-categories. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), followed by robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
