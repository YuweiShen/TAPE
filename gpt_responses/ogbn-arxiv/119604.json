The paper also provides analysis of several concrete models, including Linear Models, FM, MVM, Perceptron, MLP and Deep Neural Networks, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
