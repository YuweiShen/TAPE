Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The method involves image processing techniques such as filtering and thresholding, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) fields. The paper also mentions the use of Fourier transform, which is a common technique in signal processing and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) only in the sense of providing a clear and concise abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
