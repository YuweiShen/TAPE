The approach involves selectively sharing information across tasks based on the overlap in sparsity patterns, which suggests a focus on optimization and regularization techniques (cs.AI). The experiments involve image classification and natural language processing tasks, indicating a potential fit with computer vision (cs.CV) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of low-dimensional subspaces, which is a common technique in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
