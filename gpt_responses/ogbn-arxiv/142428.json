The paper also discusses the use of tensor decomposition (TD) for compression, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper analyzes the influence of spatial similarity on the low-rank structure of the kernels, which is a topic related to data analysis and machine learning (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
