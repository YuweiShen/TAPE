The paper also includes experiments on image classification tasks (cs.CV) and discusses the generalizability of the findings to more complex problems (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper touches on the topic of optimization (cs.SI) in the context of gradient descent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
