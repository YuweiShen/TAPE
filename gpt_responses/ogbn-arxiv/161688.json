The use of sparse representation modeling and dictionary learning also suggests a possible fit with the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Finally, the development of upper bounds and worst-case analysis is a common technique in Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
