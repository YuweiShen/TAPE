The problem also has applications in interface modelling of wireless networks, which falls under the category of computer networks (cs.NI). The paper presents an approximation algorithm for the maximum edge $2$-colouring problem, which is a graph theory problem and hence falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also involves the analysis of algorithms, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
