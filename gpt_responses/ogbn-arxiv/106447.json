The paper also discusses the use of drift detection and feature selection methods, which are commonly used in data mining and data stream analysis (cs.DM). The paper's focus on deep learning and neural networks suggests that it may fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's emphasis on continual learning and non-stationary data streams suggests that it may also fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
