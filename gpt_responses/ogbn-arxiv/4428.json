The paper focuses on the use of reconfigurable antennas and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
