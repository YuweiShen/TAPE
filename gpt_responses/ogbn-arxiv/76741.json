The proposed architecture involves a recurrent network with memory units, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a new memory cell, which involves learning to selectively preserve spatio-temporal correlation, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve analyzing the performance of the proposed architecture on a dataset of cars, which is a common object of interest in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
