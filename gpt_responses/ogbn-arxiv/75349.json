This topic falls under the area of formal methods and verification, which is typically categorized under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). The paper also discusses the complexity of deciding monitorability and liveness, which falls under cs.PL (Complexity Theory and Cryptography).
