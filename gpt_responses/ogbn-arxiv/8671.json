This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also deals with natural language processing (NLP) and semantic feature space, which are relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of NMF for clustering can also be applied to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
