Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper uses a novel deep learning technique based on hypercolumn descriptors, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with the classification of cells in large-scale patient cohorts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
