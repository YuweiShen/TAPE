The use of bounded rationality and coarse beliefs also suggests a connection to computational economics (cs.EC) and decision making (cs.DS). Finally, the construction of good voting rules may involve optimization and algorithm design, which are topics in social computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
