This involves object detection, obstacle avoidance, and semantic mapping, which are all computer vision tasks. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The system also includes a touch-based interaction component, which is designed to help visually impaired people understand their 3D surroundings. This involves designing user interfaces that are accessible and intuitive for people with visual impairments, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The system includes a wearable terminal equipped with an RGBD camera, which can be seen as a type of robot that is worn by the user. The system also involves obstacle avoidance, which is a common problem in robotics. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The system is based on a data-driven learning approach that uses deep learning to predict safe and reliable walkable instructions. This involves training a model on a dataset of RGBD data and semantic maps, which is a machine learning task. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The system uses artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning to assist visually impaired people in perceiving their environment. This involves developing intelligent algorithms that can analyze RGBD data and make decisions based on that analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
