The use of recurrent models of visual attention (RAM) and machine learning methods for feature extraction and control strategy optimization suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the organization of human haptic search behavior, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of online data acquisition and optimization suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
