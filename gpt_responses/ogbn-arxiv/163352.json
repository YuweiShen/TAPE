The paper also discusses covertness metrics and their impact on information-theoretic limits, which could potentially place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. The use of pulse position modulation as the optimal scheme for covert communication suggests that the paper could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. The paper's focus on the technical details of code design and expurgation arguments suggests that it could also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) category. Finally, the paper's discussion of missed detection probability and false alarm probability suggests that it could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
