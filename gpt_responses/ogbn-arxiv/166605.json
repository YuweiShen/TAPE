The paper proposes a novel training strategy for anchor-free detectors, which involves optimization techniques and feature selection. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the speed/accuracy trade-off, which is a common concern in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
