This falls under the purview of computational linguistics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses automatic methods for selecting the funniest caption, which involves machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This makes it relevant to the AI community.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning methods to analyze and select the funniest captions, which makes it relevant to the machine learning community.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper mentions the possibility of extending the analysis to multimodal systems that involve both text and vision. This makes it relevant to the computer vision community.\n- cs.SD (Sound): Although not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, humor can also be conveyed through sound. Therefore, this paper could potentially be relevant to the sound community as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
