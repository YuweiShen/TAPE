The use of biLSTM network with co-attention mechanism and self attention on embeddings suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The incorporation of hand-crafted features also suggests the paper may belong to the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
