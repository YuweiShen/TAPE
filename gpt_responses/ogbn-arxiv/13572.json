It also involves feature ranking techniques to measure the importance of neurons in the final response layer, which is a common approach in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it involves optimizing neural networks and improving their predictive power. The paper may also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it involves pruning neurons in a network. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves feature ranking techniques, which are commonly used in text classification tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
