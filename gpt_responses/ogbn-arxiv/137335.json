This involves addressing issues such as complex noisy connections, high heterogeneity, and oversmoothing of GNNs. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on a large-scale real-world dataset. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
