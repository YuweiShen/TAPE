The extension of the definition to capture degrees of responsibility and blame involves probabilistic reasoning, which is also relevant to computational ethics and decision-making (cs.CE, cs.CR). The paper also touches on issues of typicality and epistemic states, which are relevant to the field of social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
