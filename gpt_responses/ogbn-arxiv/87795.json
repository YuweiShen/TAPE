The algorithmic application mentioned in the abstract suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the use of separation bounds suggests that the paper may be related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
