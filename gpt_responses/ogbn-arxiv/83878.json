It proposes a new program behavior model that incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. The paper also presents a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
