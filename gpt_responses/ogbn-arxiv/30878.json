The approach of using evolutionary synthesis to produce efficient networks is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the stress-induced evolutionary synthesis framework is a novel approach that could also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
