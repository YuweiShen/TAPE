This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), specifically machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) for sensorially complex robots. The paper also discusses the integration of classical robotics and other approaches from artificial intelligence, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
