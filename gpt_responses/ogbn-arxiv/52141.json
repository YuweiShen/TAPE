The paper also proposes an algorithm for efficient computation of betweenness centrality, which falls under the category of social network analysis (cs.SD) and graph algorithms (cs.DS). The use of non-uniform node sampling model and analysis of Erdos-Renyi graphs suggests a focus on statistical analysis and modeling (cs.SY) and network inference (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
