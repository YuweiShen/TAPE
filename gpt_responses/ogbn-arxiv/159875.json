The paper also discusses techniques for optimizing the decoding process, which could fall under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and embedded systems (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of logarithmic domain processing to reduce complexity, which could be relevant to digital signal processing (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
