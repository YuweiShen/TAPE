The paper proposes a new sampling algorithm for graph-based active learning, which is likely to be of interest to the machine learning community. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also deals with graph theory and signal processing, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory). \n\nFinally, the paper compares its proposed method with a state-of-the-art method based on graph spectral properties, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
