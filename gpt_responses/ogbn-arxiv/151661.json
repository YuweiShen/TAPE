The use of attention mechanisms is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.AI), which are also relevant to this work. The paper proposes a new model for integrating two types of attention, which involves optimizing the model's performance (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed approach using various evaluation metrics, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
