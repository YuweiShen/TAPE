This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques, such as object detection, which suggests that it could also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) category. Additionally, the use of semantic object features involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), which is another likely category. The paper also discusses the robustness of the algorithm, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
