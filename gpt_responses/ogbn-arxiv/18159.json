The method involves a transformation that reduces the number of roots of each transformed value, which could be seen as a technique for error-correcting codes (cs.IT) or algebraic coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of the method for other exponents, which could be related to number theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a more efficient transformation, which could be seen as a machine learning or optimization problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
