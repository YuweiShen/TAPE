It also presents two specific schemes and proves their security. This fits well within the scope of cs.CR.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the performance of the proposed schemes and suggests methods to improve the performance of ciphertext comparisons. This involves analyzing the computational complexity of the schemes, which is a topic of interest in cs.CC.\n3. cs.DB (Databases) - Order-revealing encryption is a useful primitive for range queries on encrypted data, which is a topic of interest in databases. The paper proposes a multi-client version of this primitive, which could be relevant to the database community.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new cryptographic primitive and presents two specific schemes. This involves designing and analyzing algorithms, which is a topic of interest in cs.DS.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper defines a security model for the proposed primitive and quantifies the amount of information leaked by the scheme. This involves concepts from information theory, which is a topic of interest in cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
