This problem is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves matching queries (user visits) with documents (contracts). The use of compact allocation plans suggests the use of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM) to efficiently solve the problem. The evaluation of the approach on real data suggests the use of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
