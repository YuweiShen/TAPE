Information theory is a relevant sub-category as it deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. \n2. cs.GT (Game Theory) - The paper uses the multi-player multi-armed bandits framework to model the spectrum access problem. Game theory is a relevant sub-category as it deals with the study of strategic decision-making in situations where multiple players are involved. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper presents a policy that achieves expected regret of order $O(\\log^{2+\\delta}{T})$ for some $\\delta > 0$. Machine learning is a relevant sub-category as it deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of spectrum access, which is a common problem in wireless communication systems. Networking and Internet Architecture is a relevant sub-category as it deals with the design and implementation of computer networks and communication protocols. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of spectrum access, which is a control problem in wireless communication systems.
