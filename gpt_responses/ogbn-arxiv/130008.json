This involves the use of a trained sparse auto-encoder to extract rich unsupervised features, which are then correlated and passed through a moving-average filter to obtain the auto-encoder correlation-based (AEC) rate. The paper focuses on the application of this technique to machine bearings. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
