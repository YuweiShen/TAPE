This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.AI, which is the primary category for XAI research. Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on deep learning models, which are commonly used in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) applications, making cs.CV and cs.CL possible categories. The paper also mentions the use of adversarial examples, which is a topic that falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the incorporation of business or domain constraints, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
