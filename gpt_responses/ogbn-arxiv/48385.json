The paper presents a data structure that occupies limited space and provides an approximate solution to the problem. This makes it relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
