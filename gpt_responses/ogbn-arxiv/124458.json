This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Of these, cs.SI and cs.SD are the most likely, as they directly relate to the analysis of social networks and software engineering techniques for data analysis.
