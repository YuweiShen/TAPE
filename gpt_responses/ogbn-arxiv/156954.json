The paper focuses on the convergence analysis of the algorithm in the non-convex stochastic setting, which suggests that it belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve various deep learning models and datasets, indicating that it may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
