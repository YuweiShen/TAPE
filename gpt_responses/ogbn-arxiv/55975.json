This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and spectral efficiency. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): FSO systems are a type of wireless optical communication system, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. The paper discusses the performance of the proposed technique under various turbulence conditions and models, which is relevant to network design and optimization. \n3. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The proposed technique involves adapting the modulation order of S-PSK to optimize the utilization of the FSO channel capacity. This involves optimization and control concepts such as adaptive algorithms and feedback control. \n4. cs.PH (Physics): FSO systems operate in the physical domain of free space, which involves atmospheric turbulence and other physical phenomena. The paper discusses the impact of turbulence on FSO system performance and proposes a technique to mitigate its effects, which is relevant to the physics of FSO systems. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed technique involves adapting the modulation order of S-PSK based on the instantaneous state of turbulence-induced fading and a pre-defined BER requirement, which involves control concepts such as feedback control and closed-loop"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
