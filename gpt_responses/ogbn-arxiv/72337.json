The paper also employs multi-task learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for improving model performance. The use of RNN-based classifiers suggests a focus on sequence modeling, which is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
