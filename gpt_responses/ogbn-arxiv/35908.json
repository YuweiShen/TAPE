This falls under the purview of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter to balance between spatial multiplexing and interference avoidance, which is a topic of interest in the field of signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the issue of interference management in cognitive radio networks, which is a key challenge in the field of cognitive radio (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
