This topic is closely related to database management systems (cs.DB) and concurrency control (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a lock-free approach for transaction isolation, which is a common problem in distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also implements and evaluates the proposed approach, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
