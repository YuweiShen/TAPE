This problem is primarily related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves developing effective strategies to improve the performance of object detection models. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of hierarchical tag systems, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of deep learning models such as SENet154 and feature pyramid modules is also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
