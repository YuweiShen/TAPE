The use of prior knowledge to explicitly utilize the target risk in the learning process suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of \"Learning Theory\" (cs.LG). The analysis of sample complexity and the use of stochastic optimization algorithm suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT), \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI), \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS), and \"Social and Information Networks\" (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
