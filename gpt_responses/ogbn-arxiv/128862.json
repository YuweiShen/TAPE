The focus on measuring and regularizing networks in function space suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of neural networks also suggests that it could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the proposed learning rule that constrains the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space in any one update suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
