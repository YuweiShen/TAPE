Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel bidirectional network that is end-to-end trainable, which falls under the category of deep learning and machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with boundary inference and feature fusion, which could fall under the categories of cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
