The iterative algorithms mentioned in the paper suggest a systems and control (cs.SY) aspect. The use of B\u00e9zout identities and the ground domain being a commutative, unital, integral domain suggest a numerical analysis (cs.NA) aspect. Finally, the appendix deals with linear complexity of reverse sequences, which is a topic in scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
