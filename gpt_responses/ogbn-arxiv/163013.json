The proposed method utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically universal compression algorithms, to learn the normal behavior of systems and detect anomalies (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also presents specific applications of the proposed method, such as detecting Botnets Command and Control channels (cs.NI) and identifying data leakage (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
