The paper specifically focuses on reducing communication costs, which is a common concern in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses convergence rates and stability properties, which are topics in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The benchmarks used in the paper involve large datasets, which is a common topic in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the algorithms on multiple nodes, which is a topic in scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
