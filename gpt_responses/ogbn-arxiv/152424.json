The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper's focus on eye-tracking and physiological eye characteristics suggests that it could also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of video-based eye-tracking suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
