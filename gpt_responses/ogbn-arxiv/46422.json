The paper also introduces a novel text representation and similarity deep learning model, Hierarchical BiLSTM Attention Model (HBAM), and compares it with other state-of-the-art language models. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to natural language processing, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to AI, which is also relevant to the paper's proposed chatbot framework. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, which is the underlying technology used in the proposed HBAM model. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers topics related to information retrieval, which is relevant to the paper's focus on finding the most similar question from a large QA dataset. \n- cs.DB (Databases): This sub-category covers topics related to databases, which is relevant to the paper's use of a knowledge graph constructed from medical data collected from the Internet."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
