This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. The paper also discusses quantization thresholds, integer constraints, and demodulation problems, which are related to Data Structures (cs.DS), Signal Processing (cs.SI), and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
