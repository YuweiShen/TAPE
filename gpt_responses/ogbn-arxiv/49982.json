This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Active learning is a subfield of machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper mentions that the proposed method works well on real data from a wide range of domains, including computer vision. This suggests that cs.CV is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper does not explicitly mention natural language processing, but the proposed method could potentially be applied to text data, which falls under the domain of computation and language.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper does not focus on data structures and algorithms, but the proposed method involves selecting samples for training, which could be seen as a data selection problem. Therefore, cs.DS is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
