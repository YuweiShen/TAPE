The use of black-box access and queries suggests a connection to computational complexity and algorithms, which falls under cs.CC. The study of hereditary graph properties and forbidden subgraphs is a topic in graph theory, which falls under cs.DM and cs.GT. The paper also involves breaking symmetry, which is a topic in information theory and coding theory, falling under cs.IT.
