The proposed model involves deep learning techniques, specifically bilinear pooling and feature alignment, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on fine-grained classification datasets, which are also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
