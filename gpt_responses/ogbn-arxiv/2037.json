The approach involves the use of deep learning to detect and track multiple aircraft, while addressing challenges such as detecting stationary aircraft and rejecting moving ground vehicles. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) are also likely sub-categories given the focus on developing an SAA system for unmanned aerial vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
