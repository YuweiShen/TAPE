The paper also explores the differences between ML models and traditional software components, which could be relevant to Software Engineering (cs.SE). The study compares the features and policies of different model stores, which involves analyzing and evaluating data, making it relevant to Learning (cs.LG) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for identifying software engineering practices specific to ML applications, which could involve Data Structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
