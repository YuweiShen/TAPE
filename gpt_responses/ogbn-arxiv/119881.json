The paper specifically addresses the issue of tail latency in short flows, which is a common problem in datacenter networks (cs.DC). The proposed solution involves prioritizing packets based on their congestion history, which involves system-level optimization (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of ECN mechanism, which is a congestion control technique (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves the use of priority queues, which is a common data structure in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
