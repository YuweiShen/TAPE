The use of collision-based testers suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS), while the analysis of sample complexity and information-theoretic optimality suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of uniformity testing also has connections to computational complexity (cs.CC), while the problem of closeness testing has connections to statistics and probability (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
