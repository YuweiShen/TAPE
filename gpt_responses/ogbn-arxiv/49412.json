This involves exploring different architectural solutions for soft error resilience in processor cores. \n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper deals with soft errors in processor cores, which are a common concern in embedded systems. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of software techniques in combination with hardware techniques for achieving soft error resilience. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with designing a framework for achieving resilience targets in digital systems, which involves control and optimization of various system parameters. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper does not directly deal with distributed or parallel computing, but the techniques and framework proposed could be applied to such systems as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
