The paper also involves group actions, which are often studied in the sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves polynomial-time algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-category cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of reduction techniques and the study of complexity classes also suggest the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
