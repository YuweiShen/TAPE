The focus is on first-order Markovian protocols, which are a specific type of interactive protocols that have been extensively studied in the literature on communication complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the achievable rates of reliable simulation, which is a central question in coding theory and information theory (cs.CR). The authors use techniques from probability theory and combinatorics to analyze the properties of Markovian protocols, which are relevant to the field of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a novel scheme for simulating Markovian protocols based on non-interactive simulation and block-wise interactive communication, which may be of interest to researchers working on distributed systems and network protocols (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
