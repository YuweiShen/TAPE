Additionally, the paper discusses the use of weakly supervised learning (cs.LG) and the performance of the models on various benchmarks (cs.AI). The paper also briefly touches on adversarial attacks (cs.CR) and the underlying characteristics of the models (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
