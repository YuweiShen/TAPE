The paper also involves hypergraph Ramsey's theorem, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, falling under cs.DS. The paper also discusses constant composition codes, which are a type of combinatorial object, and thus could be categorized under cs.CC. The paper also involves the completely positive tensor cone and the copositive tensor cone, which are topics in convex optimization and algebraic geometry, and could be categorized under cs.DM.
