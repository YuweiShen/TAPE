The techniques involve reinforcement learning, reference state initialization, and termination curriculum. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics (RO), and machine learning (LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of synthetic animations, which can be generated using computer vision (CV) techniques. Finally, the paper focuses on locomotion movements, which are relevant to the field of systems and control (SY). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
