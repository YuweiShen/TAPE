The technique involves training the network to be robust against adversarial attacks, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing adversarial training methods, which is related to the field of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed technique involves adjusting the perturbation margins for each training sample, which is a form of optimization and could be related to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
