The paper also discusses the use of policy-based data synthesis, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for these networks to be used in mobile devices, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
