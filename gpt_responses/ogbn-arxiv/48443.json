Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of a straight-through estimator (ST), which is a technique used in machine learning and optimization, indicating a possible fit for cs.SD (Software Engineering). The paper also involves optimization and training of models, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Signal Processing). Finally, the paper discusses the improvement of ASR performance, which could also fit under cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
