The paper introduces a deep learning aided method to incentivize credible sample contributions from selfish and rational agents, which falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the estimation of a certain $f$-divergence function, which is a topic in information theory. The paper uses the example of building an image classifier, which falls under the category of computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DS, cs.IT, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
