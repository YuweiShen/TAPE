The paper also discusses the encoding of integer functions, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper's focus on ordered subsequences and suffix arrays suggests that it may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
