The use of pre-trained 2D CNNs for feature extraction suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the proposed approach on a real-world clinical dataset suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of medical imaging (cs.MM). The use of deep learning techniques for classification suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of convolutional neural networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
