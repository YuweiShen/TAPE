The paper proposes a new constraint for Capon beamforming to suppress sidelobes. Information theory is closely related to wireless communication systems, and this paper may fall under this category. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with beamforming and signal processing techniques to suppress sidelobes. This category seems highly relevant to the paper. \n3. cs.SP (Speech Processing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention speech processing, beamforming is a common technique used in speech processing applications. Therefore, this category may also be relevant. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new constraint for Capon beamforming, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. Therefore, this category may also be relevant. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with beamforming, which is a common technique used in wireless communication systems. Therefore, this category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
