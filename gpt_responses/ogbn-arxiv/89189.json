The paper also discusses increasing the depth and learning capacity of networks, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method proposed in the paper involves introducing computation orderings, which is a technique that can be applied to neural networks in general (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
