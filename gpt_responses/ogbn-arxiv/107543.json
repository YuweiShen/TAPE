The notion of \"protected attribute\" and \"equalized odds\" are related to fairness and privacy, which are also important topics in computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem, which is relevant to the field of computational complexity and algorithms (cs.CY). Finally, the paper proposes a relaxation of the non-discrimination definition, which involves statistical moments, and this is related to the field of statistical inference and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
