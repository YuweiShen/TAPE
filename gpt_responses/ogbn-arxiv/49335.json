The paper also discusses the trade-off between rate and complexity which is a common theme in Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Communications Engineering (cs.CE). The use of weight matrices with specific properties suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Network Information Theory (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of an exhaustive search which is a common technique in Multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
