This makes it relevant to the field of databases. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a deep learning approach for text-to-SQL generation, which is a subfield of AI. \n4. cs.LG (Learning) - The paper proposes a neural architecture for text-to-SQL generation, which involves training a model to learn from data. This makes it relevant to the field of machine learning and falls under cs.LG. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper deals with generating SQL queries from natural language text, which is a task that involves retrieving relevant information from a database.
