The optimization problem formulation also involves signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which is a common metric in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses resource allocation algorithm design for multiuser communication systems, which is a networking problem. The use of power splitting receivers and artificial noise also involves wireless networking concepts.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The optimization problem formulation and solution involve control theory concepts such as beamforming and covariance matrix optimization.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions the maximum tolerable data rate at potential eavesdroppers, which is a multimedia security concern.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper aims to provide secure communication in the presence of potential eavesdroppers, which is a key topic in cryptography and security. The use of artificial noise is also a common technique in secure communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
