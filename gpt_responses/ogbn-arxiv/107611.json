The paper also focuses on improving memory usage and data shuffling, which are important aspects of database systems (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS). The experiments performed in the paper involve processing large-scale real-world graphs, which is a common problem in network science and graph theory (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach for memory management and data processing, which can be considered a contribution to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
