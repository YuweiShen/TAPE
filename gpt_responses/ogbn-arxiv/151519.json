The proposed method involves the use of deep neural networks (NN) and is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NE) subcategories. The experiments conducted in the paper involve digit recognition and face recognition, which are both common tasks in multimedia (MM) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
