These topics are closely related to several sub-categories in computer science, including Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Game Theory and Economics (cs.GT), Information Theory (cs.IT), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on the mathematical properties of submodular and ${\\rm M}^{\\natural}$-concave functions, rather than their applications in computer science, we believe that cs.DM and cs.CC are the most likely sub-categories. The other three sub-categories are also possible, but less likely, as they are more focused on applications of these concepts in specific areas of computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
