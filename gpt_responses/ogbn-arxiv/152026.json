This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the noise generated during the label collection process, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques to generate candidate labels, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
