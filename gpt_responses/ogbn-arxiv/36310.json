This involves using a graph to plan a sequence of manipulation primitives, which is then translated into robot motions. This work involves robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for planning and execution. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) for object recognition and localization, as well as machine learning (cs.LG) for learning manipulation primitives. Finally, the use of a dual arm robot with parallel grippers suggests that this work may also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
