This work involves both parallel programming and runtime systems, which are typically covered in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the performance of hpxMP compared to Clang's OpenMP library on linear algebra benchmarks, which falls under the Performance (cs.PF) sub-category. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges of porting legacy applications to AMT systems, which is a software engineering concern covered in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the adoption of higher-level interfaces in standards conforming runtime systems, which is a topic covered in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
