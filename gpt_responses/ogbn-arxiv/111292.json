The paper also discusses the use of expander graphs, which are often studied in the context of distributed systems (cs.DS) and network science (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper uses concepts such as trapping sets and fixed sets, which are relevant to the study of error correction codes in the context of network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
