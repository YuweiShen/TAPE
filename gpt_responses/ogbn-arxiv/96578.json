The paper also proposes a new approach to adversarial training, which involves combining search-based techniques with abstraction-based techniques. This approach is relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of string transformations, which are relevant to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper applies its approach to datasets and shows that the resulting models are robust to combinations of user-defined transformations, which is relevant to the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
