The paper also discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the need for workload-adaptive and self-tuning RDF data management systems, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
