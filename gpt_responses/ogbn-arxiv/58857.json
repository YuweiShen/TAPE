The proposed method involves local analysis of image blocks, which suggests the use of signal processing techniques (cs.IT). The paper also mentions the importance of having low hardware complexity, which is relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM). The application of the proposed method is in the medical field, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and the use of image processing techniques for medical diagnosis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
