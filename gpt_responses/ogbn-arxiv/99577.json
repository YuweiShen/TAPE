The approach is data-driven and does not assume data distribution, which is a common theme in machine learning. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with the problem of estimating a threshold for a tail probability of a random sequence, which is a statistical problem. The paper also discusses the estimation of parameters of extreme value distributions and the extremal index, which are statistical concepts. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the problem of estimating a threshold for a tail probability of a random sequence, which can be seen as a problem of information theory. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a computational approach for estimating the threshold, which involves estimating parameters of extreme value distributions and the extremal index. This involves the use of algorithms and data structures. \n- cs.PR (Probability): The paper deals with the problem of estimating a threshold for a tail probability of a random sequence, which is a problem in probability theory. The paper also discusses the estimation of parameters of extreme value distributions and the extremal index, which are concepts in probability theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
