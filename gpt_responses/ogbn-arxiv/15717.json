Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves training neural network models with different hyperparameters, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of a database and the comparison of results also suggest the sub-categories of cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper involves information retrieval techniques to build the database, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
