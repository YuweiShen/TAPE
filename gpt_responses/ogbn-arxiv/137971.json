The use of deep learning also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The mention of contextual information and multi-scale learning could also suggest Multimedia (cs.MM) as a possible category. Finally, the use of a deep network and the mention of improving performance could suggest Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) as another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
