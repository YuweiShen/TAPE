The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which suggests that it could belong to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper involves optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, which could place it in the categories of operations research (cs.RO) or social and information networks (cs.SI).
