It also involves the analysis of the autocorrelation of these sequences, which is a common technique in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper uses mathematical methods to analyze the complexity of these sequences, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the practical applications of these sequences, such as in coding theory and cryptography, which falls under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
