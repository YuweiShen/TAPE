This problem is related to compressive sensing, which is a subfield of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of a cognitive receiver that can adapt its sensing strategy based on the observed data, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a Markov chain to model the dynamics of the underlying random vector, which is a topic of interest in control theory (cs.SY) and networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
