The use of Convolutional Neural Networks for this purpose also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of Transfer Learning and End-to-End Learning techniques suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
