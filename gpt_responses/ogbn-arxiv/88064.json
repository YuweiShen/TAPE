Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper proposes a new learning method for MOBA games. The paper also discusses multi-agent cooperation, which suggests the sub-category cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper uses a dense reward function, which could fall under the sub-category cs.GT (Game Theory). Finally, the paper mentions experiments with a mobile MOBA game, which could relate to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the game involves visual input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
