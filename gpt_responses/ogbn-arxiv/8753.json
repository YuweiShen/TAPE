The paper also mentions the use of digital distributed coding, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The use of deterministic annealing, a global optimization framework, is a technique that has been applied in various fields, including machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SI, cs.MM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
