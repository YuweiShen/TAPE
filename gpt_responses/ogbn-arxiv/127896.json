The paper also discusses the existence of Nash equilibria on different classes of graphs, which involves graph theory (cs.DM) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses mathematical techniques to prove the existence of equilibria, which can be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
