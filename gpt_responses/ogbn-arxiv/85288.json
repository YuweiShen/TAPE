Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also focuses on autonomous navigation, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) category. The use of deep neural networks suggests that the paper may also belong to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the training time and convergence, which are related to neural networks (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
