Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions numerical experiments, indicating a focus on empirical evaluation, which could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
