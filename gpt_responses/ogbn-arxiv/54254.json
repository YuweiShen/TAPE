The paper discusses the challenges of handling images from different domains and how to jointly train for multiple product objectives. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach through offline metrics, user studies, and online A/B experiments. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
