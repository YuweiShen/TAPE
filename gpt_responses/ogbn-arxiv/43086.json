The use of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and control theory suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The mention of hybrid systems and numerical implementation using sum-of-squares (SOS) programs suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
