The use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) also suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves sequence labeling, which is a common task in information retrieval, suggesting that it may also belong to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval).
