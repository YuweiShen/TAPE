This involves low-level details of the language and its runtime environment, which are typical concerns of programming languages research. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper addresses the need for dynamic analysis tools for WebAssembly to ensure the security, performance, and correctness of future web applications. This is a software engineering concern that involves developing tools and techniques to improve the quality of software. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the need for security in web applications and presents taint analysis as one of the dynamic analyses that can be implemented using the framework. Taint analysis is a technique for identifying and tracking data flows in a program to detect potential security vulnerabilities. \n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the challenges of dynamically analyzing WebAssembly, such as tracing type-polymorphic instructions and controlling the overhead imposed by an analysis. These are architectural concerns that involve designing and implementing efficient and effective systems. \n- cs.SD (Software Development): The paper presents a framework that makes it straightforward to implement various dynamic analyses, including instruction counting, call graph extraction, memory access tracing, and taint analysis. This is a software development concern that involves providing developers with tools and techniques to improve their productivity and the quality"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
