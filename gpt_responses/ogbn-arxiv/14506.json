This is a fundamental problem in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a communication channel where multiple primary users are interested in the same message. This is a relevant problem in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes capacity results for a cognitive interference channel, which is a system that involves multiple agents interacting with each other. This is a relevant problem in systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper reports capacity regions of the corresponding Gaussian settings, which is a relevant problem in multimedia communication. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Although the paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, the problem of interference management is relevant in secure communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
