The paper also explores self-supervision techniques for learning without manual labels, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also discuss the use of data augmentation, which is a common technique in both computer vision and machine learning. Additionally, the paper touches on the use of synthetic transformations, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
