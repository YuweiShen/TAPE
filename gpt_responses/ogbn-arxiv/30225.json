The paper focuses on improving the feature aggregation strategy in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) by allowing nodes to adaptively select the optimal neighbors. This falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on several datasets, including image classification (cs.CV) and sentiment analysis (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper introduces a unified regularization framework for GmCN, which can be seen as a form of optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
