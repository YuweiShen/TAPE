The use of word-vectors and semantic spaces also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also proposes improvements to the standard zero-shot learning pipeline, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
