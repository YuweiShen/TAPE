The paper specifically focuses on the Possible Winner (PW) problem, which is a fundamental algorithmic problem in computational social choice. The paper investigates the PW problem on partial chains, which are a type of partial order that arises in various settings, including rankings of movies or restaurants. \n\nBased on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), which is the subfield of theoretical computer science that deals with the mathematical modeling and analysis of strategic interactions among agents. The PW problem is a classic problem in computational social choice and is closely related to voting theory, which is a central topic in game theory. \n\nThe second likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which is the subfield of computer science that deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures. The paper establishes the complexity of the PW problem on partial chains, which involves analyzing the computational complexity of algorithms for solving the problem. \n\nThe third likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which is the subfield of computer science that deals with the design and analysis of intelligent agents and systems.
