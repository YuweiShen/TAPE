This technique involves using a decision procedure for a subset of first-order logic and symbolic methods originally developed for finite-state model checking. The paper specifically focuses on models containing first-order state variables, where the system state includes mutable functions and predicates. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category deals with the use of logic in computer science, including formal methods, automated reasoning, and verification. Predicate abstraction is a technique used in formal verification, making it likely that the paper belongs to this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages. Predicate abstraction is a technique used in the analysis of software systems, making it likely that the paper belongs to this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. Predicate abstraction is a technique used in the verification of software systems, making it likely that the paper belongs to this sub-category.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of formal languages and automata, including their use in the specification and verification of software systems.
