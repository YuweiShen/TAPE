Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of input resolution for achieving optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off, which is a topic that falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also proposes a framework for mutually learning from different input resolutions and network widths, which involves optimization techniques that are commonly used in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed framework on object detection and instance segmentation tasks, which are topics that fall under the Computation and Language (cs.CL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
