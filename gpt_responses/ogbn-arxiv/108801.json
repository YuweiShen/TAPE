Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the ongoing efforts in the 3GPP for the evolution towards 5G cellular systems, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper presents the design of an active antenna system (AAS) and discusses the optimization of antenna ports, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper mentions the development of a 3D channel model, which could be related to cs.AR (Augmented Reality)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
