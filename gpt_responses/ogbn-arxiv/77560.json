The use of linear-time branching algorithms and kernelization routines suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of representative sets in matroids suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computational geometry (cs.CG), which often deals with geometric structures and algorithms. The evaluation of algorithms on benchmark instances suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT), which often involve the analysis and evaluation of algorithms on specific problem instances."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
