The paper also mentions the Gaussian source and binary source, which are commonly studied in the fields of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the notion of successive refinement, which is relevant to signal processing and machine learning, and thus could potentially fall under the categories of cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
