The paper also proposes a linear precoding scheme, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the roles played by transmit zero-forcing, interference alignment, random beamforming, symbol extensions, and asymmetric complex signaling, which are all related to communication and coding (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
