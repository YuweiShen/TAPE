Given that the paper proposes a new method for generating adversarial examples using syntactically controlled paraphrase networks, it is most likely to be classified under cs.CL, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI. However, since the paper also uses neural encoder-decoder models and large-scale backtranslation, it could also be relevant to cs.NE and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
