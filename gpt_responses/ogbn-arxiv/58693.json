The use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for occupancy mapping and exploration is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of gradient-based methods for computing probabilistic frontier maps, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the control and decision-making aspects of the robot, which falls under the field of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
