Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also presents routing algorithms that use constant memory and only look at direct neighbors, which are topics in distributed computing and data structures, respectively. Hence, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the visibility graph, which is a topic in graph theory, and provides lower bounds on the routing ratio, which is a topic in optimization and robotics. Therefore, cs.GR (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.RO (Robotics) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
