The paper also discusses optimization of policies, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of probabilistic guarantees and optimization of expectations are also relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with Markov decision processes, which are a type of stochastic process, making the paper relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
