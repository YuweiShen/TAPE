The experiments are conducted on image datasets, which further supports the relevance to these sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of batch normalization for training on mobile or embedded devices, which suggests a potential connection to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The proposed method involves computing statistics along different dimensions, which could be related to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experiments with image classification, which could also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
