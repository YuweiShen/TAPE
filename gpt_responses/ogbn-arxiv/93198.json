Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a design principle and considers different decoding architectures, which fall under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), which are related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
