The paper proposes a novel NLI model that reasons relationships from multiple perspectives associated with the three relationships (entailment, neutral, and contradiction). This involves routing-by-agreement policy and making the final decision from a holistic view, which suggests the involvement of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces an auxiliary supervised signal to ensure the model learns the expected perspectives, which further supports the involvement of Neural Networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed model on SNLI and MultiNLI datasets, which involve natural language processing and potentially Computer Vision (cs.CV) for image-related tasks in the datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
