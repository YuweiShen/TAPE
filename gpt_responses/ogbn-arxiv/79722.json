However, the paper also discusses the use of lambda calculi in cryptography, which is a topic that falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also touches on information theory (cs.IT) and programming languages (cs.PL) due to its focus on lambda calculi. Finally, the paper discusses computational complexity (cs.CC) in the context of probabilistic polynomial time computable functions. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LO and cs.CR, followed by cs.IT, cs.PL, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
