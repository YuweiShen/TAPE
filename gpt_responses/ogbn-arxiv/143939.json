It also uses reinforcement learning techniques to train agents on the Atari suite. Additionally, it could also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) because it deals with training agents to perform tasks. Computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a possible sub-category since the Atari games involve visual input. Finally, it could belong to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY) because it deals with controlling the behavior of agents in a Markov decision process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
