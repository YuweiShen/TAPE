The approach is based on constructing a 3-connected graph, which is a well-studied topic in combinatorial and geometric graph theory (cs.CG, cs.DM). The algorithm also maintains a planar embedding, which involves data structures and algorithms for maintaining planar graphs (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the Kuratowski-subdivision, which is a classical result in graph theory and topology (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents a linear-time algorithm, which is a common theme in algorithm design and analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
