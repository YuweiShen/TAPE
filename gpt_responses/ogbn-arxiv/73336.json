The use of machine learning models for classification also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The comparison of human and machine performance on the task of fine-grained race classification involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of deep neural networks for classification suggests the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of a face database and the focus on facial features suggests the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
