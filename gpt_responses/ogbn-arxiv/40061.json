The use of Bayesian networks and Time-Dependent Markov Processes (TMDPs) for alerting automation policies suggests a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the interaction between the automated system and the pilot, indicating a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of TMDPs also suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY), while the overall goal of improving safety in aircraft suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
