It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as hand pose estimation is an important task in human-robot interaction. Additionally, the use of structured region ensemble networks and tree-structured fully connections suggests that this paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of public hand pose datasets and the focus on performance evaluation suggests that this paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
