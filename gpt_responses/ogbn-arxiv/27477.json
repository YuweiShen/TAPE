This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper proposes a new approach to extract local features from videos and aggregate them into global features for action recognition. This involves training a mapping function on the same training data to map the global features into global labels, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of maximum pooling on sparsely sampled features, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper involves the study of different methods for aggregating local features, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed approach on two popular action recognition datasets, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
