The paper proposes a novel NMT architecture called Block Multitask Learning (BMTL) that predicts multiple targets of different granularities simultaneously, removing the need to search for the optimal segmentation strategy. This involves a combination of techniques from machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper involves the use of neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper involves the use of image-based techniques for NMT, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
