The paper proposes two metrics for measuring the informativeness of an object hypothesis, which are based on the overlapping ratio between the region proposal and the final prediction, and the variation of predicted object locations when input images are corrupted by noise. These metrics are used to reduce the amount of labeled training data needed for object detection, which is a problem that can be addressed using machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it discusses the use of text data for image annotation. Finally, the paper uses information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques to select the most informative samples for annotation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
