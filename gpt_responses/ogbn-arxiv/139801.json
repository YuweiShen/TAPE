The application of these bounds to ensembles of codes on graphs suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.DS). The mention of sphere-packing bounds and information-theoretic bounds on the bit error probability further supports the relevance to information theory and coding theory. The potential application to turbo-like codes suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
