This involves developing a shallow CNN to derive \"virtual\" recombined images from FFDM images and a deep CNN to extract features from both LE and recombined images for ensemble models to classify cases as benign vs. cancer. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper involves developing a CNN approach for improved breast cancer diagnosis using medical images, which falls under the scope of computer vision. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves developing a machine learning approach using CNNs for improved breast cancer diagnosis, which falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves using medical images for breast cancer diagnosis, which falls under the scope of multimedia. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves using medical images for classification of benign vs. cancer cases, which falls under the scope of information retrieval. \n- cs.DL (Deep Learning): The paper involves developing a deep CNN approach for improved breast cancer diagnosis, which falls under the scope of deep learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
