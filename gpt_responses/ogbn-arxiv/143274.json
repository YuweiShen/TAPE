Information theory is closely related to coding techniques and communication systems, making this category the most likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the delivery of contents to multiple cache-enabled user terminals, which is a networking problem. The use of multiple antennas at the base station also suggests a networking and internet architecture perspective.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the delivery of contents to multiple users, which can be seen as a social network problem. The use of caching also suggests a network optimization perspective, which is relevant to this category.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of coded caching technique to improve the delivery of contents, which can be seen as an algorithmic problem. The derivation of closed-form rate expressions also suggests an analytical approach, which is relevant to this category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the delivery of contents to multiple users, which is a multimedia problem. The use of multiple antennas at the base station also suggests a multimedia perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
