The specific problem of editing a graph to a connected graph of given degrees is closely related to graph connectivity (cs.DS), as well as graph coloring and partitioning (cs.DM). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DM, cs.DS, cs.CG, cs.GT, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
