However, the focus on limited feedback channels and frequency selectivity suggests that the paper is most likely to be categorized under Information Theory (cs.IT) or Communications (cs.COMM). The use of large antenna arrays and spatial multiplexing also suggests a possible categorization under Signal Processing (cs.SY) or Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the consideration of low complexity algorithms and hardware constraints suggests a possible categorization under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
