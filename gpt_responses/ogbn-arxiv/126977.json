Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses signal words to improve classification accuracy, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with identifying and extracting temporal information from text. Finally, the paper's use of signal words to improve classification accuracy suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) in the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
