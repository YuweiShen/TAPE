Specifically, the paper proposes increasing the batch size during training instead of decaying the learning rate, which can lead to shorter training times and greater parallelism. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
