It also involves the use of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) which is a popular technique in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it involves training an end-to-end model. The use of interactive correction via humans-in-the-loop suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it mentions the use of splines for object annotation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
