The focus of the paper is on the use of belief propagation algorithms for structured prediction on CRBMs, and the comparison of this approach with CD methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
