The paper proposes an unsupervised objective to train sentence embeddings using compositional n-gram features. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the arXiv sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). \n\nThe paper also uses machine learning techniques to learn these embeddings, which makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised objective, which makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nThe paper also evaluates its method on benchmark tasks such as sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection, which makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) or Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
