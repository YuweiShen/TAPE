The study focuses on the visualization of saliency maps and reward-decomposition bars to improve participants' mental models of an RL agent in a simple Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI) sub-category, as it deals with the interaction between humans and RL agents. Additionally, the paper is also likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as it deals with RL agents and their understanding. The paper may also belong to the Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) sub-category, as it investigates the impact of explanations on non-experts' understanding of RL agents, which may have implications for security. Finally, the paper may belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category, as it deals with the visualization of saliency maps and reward-decomposition bars."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
