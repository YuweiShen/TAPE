The focus of the paper is on identifying best safety engineering practices for NN and other learning-enabled components, which suggests a software engineering (cs.SE) perspective. The proposed metrics for measuring NN dependability attributes, such as robustness, interpretability, completeness, and correctness, indicate a focus on security and privacy (cs.CR) as well as control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
