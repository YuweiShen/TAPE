The paper also proposes a model that learns to ground (localize) mentioned characters and do visual co-reference resolution, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed model on the MPII Movie Description dataset, which is a multimedia dataset (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
