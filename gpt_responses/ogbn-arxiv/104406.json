It also involves generating adversarial perturbations, which is a common topic in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses black-box attacks, which falls under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The algorithm proposed in the paper involves generating perturbations without accessing the inner states of the DNN, which is related to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experimentation with a DNN, which is a common topic in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
