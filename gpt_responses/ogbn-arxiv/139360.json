The study involves numerical simulations and experiments to investigate the synchronization behavior of two oscillators based on thermally coupled VO2 switches. This falls under the domain of neural computing and hence, cs.NE is the most likely category.\n\n2. cs.ET (Embedded Systems) - The paper discusses the use of VO2 switches in ONNs, which can be considered as embedded systems. The study involves the analysis of the external circuit capacitance and resistance, which are important parameters in embedded systems design. Hence, cs.ET is a likely category.\n\n3. cs.EM (Electromagnetism) - The study involves the use of VO2 switches, which are based on the principles of electromagnetism. The paper discusses the effective action radius RTC of coupling, which depends on the total energy released during switching and on the average power. Hence, cs.EM is a likely category.\n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The study involves the analysis of the synchronization behavior of two oscillators based on thermally coupled VO2 switches. The paper proposes an advanced algorithm for synchronization efficiency and subharmonic ratio calculation. Hence, cs.SY is a likely category.\n\n5"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
