The proposed method involves interleaving planning and learning, which is a common theme in reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The Iterated-Width (IW) planner, which is used in the planning step, is a state-of-the-art planner in robotics (cs.RO) and planning (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the evaluation of the proposed method in a subset of the Atari games suite, which is a popular benchmark in machine learning for games (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
