Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new method for optimizing product quantization using SIMD instructions, which falls under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on multimedia retrieval systems, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
