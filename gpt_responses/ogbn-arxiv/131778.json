It is also likely to belong to cs.ET (Embedded Systems) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) because it deals with energy-efficient computing and runtime swapping of approximators. Additionally, it may belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) because it proposes efficient co-training methods for the MCMA architecture and deals with neural approximators and classifiers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
