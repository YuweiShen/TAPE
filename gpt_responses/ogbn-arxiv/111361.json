Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses tools from additive combinatorics, which is a subfield of discrete mathematics, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also mentions the use of simulation, which is a topic in cryptography, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category.
