It also explores the effect of embodiment on social interactions, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of socially assistive robotics suggests a potential application in systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the review and analysis of existing work involves machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
