The paper proposes a method to mitigate the issue and discusses potential directions for further research. Given the focus on machine learning and control, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions experiments involving image-based control tasks, which suggests a potential connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the issue in the context of control theory, which suggests a potential connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
