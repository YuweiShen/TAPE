The approach involves capturing implicit feedback through mouse moves and explicit interaction with data points, which can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach through realistic examples, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
