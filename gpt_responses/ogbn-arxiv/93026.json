The architecture is designed to scale linearly with the number of agents, which is a characteristic of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The method is evaluated on tasks from chess and soccer, which are domains related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
