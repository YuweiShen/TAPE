The paper proposes a new framework for unifying recent developments in variational bounds parameterized by neural networks, which are commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
