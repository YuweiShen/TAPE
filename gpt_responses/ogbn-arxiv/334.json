This involves techniques such as network inference, link prediction, and semantic analysis of posts. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also deals with limited resources and fetching data efficiently, which falls under cs.SD (Software Development and Programming). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques for analyzing posts. Finally, the paper uses PageRank as the metric for influence computation, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
