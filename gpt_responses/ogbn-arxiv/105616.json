The paper also presents a sampling framework that optimizes the quality of multiple answers to group-by queries, which involves statistical analysis and optimization (cs.DS). The framework uses a metric based on the norm of the coefficients of variation (CVs), which is a statistical measure commonly used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses how the framework can be tuned to cases where partial information about a query workload is known, which involves information theory and optimization (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
