The paper proposes a model-based control with regression trees algorithm (mbCRT) for demand response (DR) and integrates it into an open-source tool called DR-Advisor. The paper also compares DR-Advisor with other data-driven methods and ranks 2nd on ASHRAE's benchmarking dataset for energy prediction. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
