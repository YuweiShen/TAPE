The paper also focuses on the communication problem among the intelligent agents, which is a key aspect of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The proposed conflict-avoidance mechanism and federal training method involve the use of neural networks, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The simulation scenario involves the movement of mobile agents, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of digital pheromone, which could be considered a form of control theory, making cs.SY another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
