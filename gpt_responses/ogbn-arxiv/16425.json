The paper proposes a hierarchical end-to-end model for joint learning of text summarization and sentiment classification, which involves techniques from both NLP and ML. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which also cover topics related to NLP and ML."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
