This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which falls under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
