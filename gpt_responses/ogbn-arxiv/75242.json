The paper introduces a new model called contextual decision processes and proposes a new algorithm for efficient exploration. These topics are closely related to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), robotics (cs.RO), and systems and control (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.DS, cs.RO, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
