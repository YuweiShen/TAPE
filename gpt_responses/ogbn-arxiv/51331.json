The paper draws on innovation studies, scientometrics, and other fields, indicating a broad scope. The category \"cs.CY\" (Computers and Society) is a likely fit, as the paper deals with the societal implications of emerging technologies. \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks) is also a possible category, as the paper discusses empirical approaches for detecting and studying emerging technologies, which can involve network analysis. \"cs.DL\" (Digital Libraries) is another possible category, as the paper discusses citation analysis and other bibliometric methods. \"cs.HC\" (Human-Computer Interaction) is a possible category, as the paper touches on the impact of emerging technologies on human behavior and cognition. Finally, \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) is a possible category, as the paper discusses methods for analyzing and visualizing large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
