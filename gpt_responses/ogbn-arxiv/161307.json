The undecidability results and the introduction of classical versions suggest a focus on theoretical aspects of logic. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper's title mentions \"non-associative\" and \"linear\" which are keywords associated with cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity), respectively. The paper's focus on undecidability also suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these fields often deal with undecidability and complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
