The paper also discusses the use of beamforming, which is a common technique in communication systems and signal processing, making the systems relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of multiple antennas, which is a key aspect of millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems, making it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of coding techniques, which is a common aspect of communication systems, making it relevant to the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
