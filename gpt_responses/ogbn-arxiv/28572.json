This is a topic related to logic in computer science. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions that hyperproperties include many security properties, which suggests a connection to cryptography and security. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the correctness of programs using concurrent objects and proposes a refinement notion that simplifies reasoning about hyperproperties.
