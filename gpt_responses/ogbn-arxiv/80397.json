The paper focuses on safety verification of hybrid systems (cs.SY) and proposes a new technique that allows local reasoning using system designer intuition about performance within particular modes as part of a proof task. The paper also introduces a new inference rule into the proof calculus of KeYmaera (cs.PL) and presents a methodology to discover useful forward invariants (cs.SE), which are then used with the new cut rule to complete verification tasks. Finally, the paper demonstrates how the new approach can be used to complete verification tasks involving an automotive powertrain control system (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
