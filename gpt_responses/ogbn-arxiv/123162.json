The paper proposes a distributed collaboration strategy through game theory, which involves modeling the problem as a non-transferable coalitional game (cs.GT). The paper also considers the impact of false alarm probability on the network topology and dynamics, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes simulation results that involve measuring the performance of the proposed algorithm, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
