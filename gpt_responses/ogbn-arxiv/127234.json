The technique used in the paper is based on abstract interpretation, which is a standard basis for static analysis of programs (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the challenges of precision and scaling to widely used programming languages, which are topics related to software engineering (cs.SE) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the paper presents a systematic technique for design of monitors that are correct by construction, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
