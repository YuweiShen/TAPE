The paper focuses on natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as semantic similarity, sentence surface information probing, and question-answering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP research. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as learning-to-rank and fine-tuning, which are common in sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of BERT embeddings on information retrieval tasks, which falls under the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper discusses the use of deep neural networks for question-answering tasks, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
