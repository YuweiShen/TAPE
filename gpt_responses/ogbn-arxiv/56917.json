This involves embedding entities into different latent spaces to preserve the order of relations in paths and using a pooling strategy to extract nonlinear features. This work is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves representation learning and prediction. It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as knowledge graphs often involve textual data. Additionally, it is related to databases (cs.DB) as it deals with completing and improving knowledge graphs. Finally, it may be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) as knowledge graphs can be used for information retrieval tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
