Specifically, it focuses on discounted MDPs, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) since the paper deals with learning and decision-making. Additionally, the paper mentions UCRL-style algorithms, which are commonly used in multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO), making these sub-categories also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
