The paper also uses optimal control techniques, which are commonly used in the systems and control (SY) subcategory. The paper mentions the use of adaptive step-size integrators, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (LG) to improve the efficiency of algorithms. The paper also mentions the use of receding-horizon optimal control, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) for planning and decision-making. Finally, the paper mentions the use of real-world mobile manipulators, which may involve computer vision (CV) techniques for perception and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
