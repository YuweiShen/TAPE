The use of computer search and software also suggests a possible fit in the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) due to the search for minimal field sizes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
