The problem involves submodular functions, which are often studied in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses numerical experiments, which could indicate a focus on computational methods and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
