The proposed method uses graph convolutional networks to analyze the text data and identify spam reviews. \n\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Spam review detection is a common problem in information retrieval, as it affects the quality of search results and recommendations. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy of spam review detection, which is relevant to this sub-category. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The proposed method uses a heterogeneous graph to capture the local context of a comment, which is a common approach in social network analysis. This sub-category also deals with the analysis of online communities and the detection of spam and fake accounts. \n\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method uses graph convolutional networks, which are a type of deep learning model. This sub-category deals with the development and application of machine learning algorithms, which is relevant to this paper. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Spam reviews can be used to mislead buyers and affect the reputation of online shopping websites. The proposed method aims to improve the security of Xianyu, the largest second-hand goods app in China, by detecting and removing spam reviews"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
