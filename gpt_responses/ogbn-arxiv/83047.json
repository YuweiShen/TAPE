The paper also proposes a method to learn generic, action-independent connections between representations of a person's pose, gaze, and scene cues and the interactee object's position and scale, which involves machine learning techniques and falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of data-driven natural language scene description, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
