The paper also combines results from two different domains, namely autonomous planning through Markov Decision Processes (cs.SY) and a general data clustering approach (cs.LG). The paper also discusses self-organizing problems, which is a topic that falls under the domain of robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE).
