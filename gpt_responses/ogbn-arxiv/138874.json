The model is based on visually detected linear features, which involves computer vision (CV) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of probability and likelihood, which are common in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the real-time implementation of the proposed model, which involves system engineering (SY) considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
