The proposed approach involves disentangling the embeddings into semantically distinct subspaces, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenge of capturing different notions of similarity, which is a problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed approach involves comparing it to other methods using triplet questions, which is a common evaluation metric in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
