The terms \"sensitivity\" and \"block sensitivity\" are well-known measures of complexity for Boolean functions, and the paper aims to determine the maximal separation between these measures. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which are the two most relevant sub-categories for this topic. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves constructing a sequence of Boolean functions and reporting results of a computer search, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), or cs.CG (Computational Geometry). These sub-categories are also likely because they involve the study of discrete structures and algorithms, which are relevant to the study of Boolean functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
