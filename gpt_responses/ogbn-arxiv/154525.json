The use of feedback links also suggests a possible connection to networked systems (cs.NI). The paper proposes achievable schemes and outer-bounds for different interference models, which involves system design and optimization (cs.SY). The use of lattice codes in the Gaussian case suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also involves theoretical analysis and proofs, which suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
