Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). However, the paper also discusses concepts like carrier aggregation and coordinated multi-point connectivity, which are related to information theory and communication systems, respectively. Hence, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes novel design solutions, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses throughput enhancement and latency reduction concepts, which could be related to multimedia and fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
