The paper focuses on developing automated question answering systems for social media data, which involves natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) techniques. Therefore, \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language) and \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of neural models, which falls under \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks) and \"cs.SD\" (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper deals with real-time knowledge, which could be related to \"cs.CY\" (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
