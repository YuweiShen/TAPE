Therefore, cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses variance-reduction stochastic methods and optimization techniques, which are relevant to machine learning and statistics, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) likely sub-categories as well.
