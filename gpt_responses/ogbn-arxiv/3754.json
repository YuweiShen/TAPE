The use of graph convolutional networks (GCN) is also a key aspect of the paper, which is a popular technique in both AI and LG. The paper also deals with relation extraction, which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
