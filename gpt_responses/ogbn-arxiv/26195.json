The use of exponential search trees is a well-known technique in data structures (DS) and algorithms (AL), and the paper presents an improvement on the previously known bounds for both static and dynamic tries, which suggests that the paper could be classified under the categories of data structures (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), data mining (cs.DM), algorithms (cs.AL), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
