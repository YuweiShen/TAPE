The paper also discusses text recognition and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of CNNs for classification is a machine learning technique, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
