The techniques used in the paper involve the structure of the integer cone and the set of vertices of the underlying integer polytope. These are concepts that are commonly studied in computational geometry, combinatorics, and optimization, which suggests that the paper could belong to categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
