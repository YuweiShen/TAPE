The paper discusses the use of neighborhood fields inspired by neurobiological experiments to describe distinct segments of the environment. The optimization of the cognitive map is formulated as a non-linear least squares problem, which can be efficiently solved by linear solvers. The paper also discusses loop closure and scene integration. Given the focus on robotics and computer vision, as well as the use of optimization and machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
