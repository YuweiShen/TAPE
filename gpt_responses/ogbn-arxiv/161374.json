Additionally, the paper discusses differential privacy, which is a common technique used to protect privacy in ML models, suggesting that it could also belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. The paper also discusses domain adaptation, which is a technique used to improve the performance of ML models on specific domains, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories.
