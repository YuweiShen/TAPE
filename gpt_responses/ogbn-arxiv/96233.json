The use of threshold cryptography and redundancy techniques also suggests a possible connection to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. The paper also discusses the practical implementation of the proposed architecture, which could be relevant to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category. The use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and the focus on high-assurance hardware suggest a possible connection to the cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a solution to the problem of supply chain attacks, which could be relevant to the cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
