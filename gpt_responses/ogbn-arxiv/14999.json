The paper discusses various methods for vector representations of SQL text and optimized query plans and evaluates them on multiple real SQL workloads. The paper also proposes a new embedding strategy specialized for queries based on tree-structured Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network architectures. Given the focus on database systems and natural language processing, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DB and cs.CL. However, the paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.AI and cs.LG likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval techniques, which makes cs.IR a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
