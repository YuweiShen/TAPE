This falls under the domain of sound and music processing.\n- cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper presents an iterative optimization algorithm for piano reduction, which involves controlling the difficulty of the resulting piano scores. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses probabilistic generative models and statistical inference for developing performance difficulty measures and constructing a probabilistic model for musical fidelity. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses computational methods for quantifying performance difficulty and optimizing musical fidelity, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a method for controlling performance difficulty in piano reduction, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
