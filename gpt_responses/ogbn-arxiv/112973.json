This involves multi-task learning to address high dimensionality and small cohort size challenges. The proposed approach is a deep modeling approach for non-linear multi-task censored regression, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
