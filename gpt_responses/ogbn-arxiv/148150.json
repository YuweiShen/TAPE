This falls under the category of networked and distributed systems (cs.NI). The paper proposes two approaches, one based on statistical knowledge and the other based on machine learning, to optimize throughput in the scheduling process. This involves modeling the problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) process, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of channel state information (CSI) and the limitations of its accuracy, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The proposed approaches involve optimization and decision-making, which falls under the category of control and systems theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a solution that is widely applicable to many real operational environments, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
