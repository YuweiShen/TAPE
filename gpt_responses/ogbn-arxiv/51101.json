The paper discusses the shortcomings of existing aggregate losses and proposes a new method that adaptsively minimizes the loss for points close to the decision boundary. This topic is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. Additionally, the paper conducts experiments on benchmark datasets that involve image classification (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential security implications of suboptimal decision boundaries, which falls under the cs.CR sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
