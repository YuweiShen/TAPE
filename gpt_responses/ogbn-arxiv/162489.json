The use of attention-based encoder-decoder framework and LSTM-based captioning framework suggests that the paper may also fall under natural language processing (cs.CL). The integration of semantic and spatial object relationships into image encoder involves learning and modeling, which are areas of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset, which is a multimedia dataset (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
