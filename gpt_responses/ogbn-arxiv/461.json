The use of matrix factorization and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) also suggests that the paper could belong to the subcategories of linear algebra (cs.LA) or numerical analysis (cs.NA). However, the focus on learning from incomplete ratings and the use of adaptive gradient optimizer suggests that the paper is more likely to belong to the subcategories of machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
