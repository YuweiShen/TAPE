It may also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because summarization is a common task in this field. Additionally, the paper discusses the interpretability of the model, which could fall under Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions abstractive training, which involves generating new text, and could be related to Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
