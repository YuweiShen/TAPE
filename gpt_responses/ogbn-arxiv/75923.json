This problem is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), systems and control (cs.SY), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), machine learning (cs.MA), and learning (cs.LG). However, given the focus on theoretical performance bounds and geometric interpretation, cs.IT and cs.SY are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
