The paper also addresses the issue of limited computational resources of sensor nodes, which is relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed scheme involves timestamping and synchronization-related computations, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
