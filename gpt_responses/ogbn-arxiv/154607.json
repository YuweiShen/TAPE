The paper also involves the use of a monocular camera for detecting helipads, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The use of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the optimization on manifold also suggests the possibility of the paper being categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques, which could also place it under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
