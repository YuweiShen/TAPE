This makes it highly likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses two real datasets from computer vision domain, indicating a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new parameter for early stopping of iterations in RVM, which suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of kernel space and statistical learning paradigm further supports the connection to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper conducts intensive experiments on several classification datasets, indicating a possible connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
