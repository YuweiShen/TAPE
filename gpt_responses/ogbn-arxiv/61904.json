The use of SVM classifiers and decision rules also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the classification of images, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of subimages and kernel evaluations suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
