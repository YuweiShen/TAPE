The construction involves blockwise Toeplitz matrices, which are commonly used in signal processing and data analysis, making the paper relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper involves the use of binomial coefficients, which are a fundamental concept in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
