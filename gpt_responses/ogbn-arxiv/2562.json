The paper focuses on the use of compressive sensing for spectrum sensing, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the organization of secondary users into clusters, which involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also evaluates the proposed scheme using several metrics, including probability of detection and error rate, which are relevant to cognitive radio networks (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses simulation results to compare the proposed scheme with other cooperative sensing schemes, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
