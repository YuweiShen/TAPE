The paper also discusses the challenges of recognizing faces in unconstrained and low-resolution images, which is a security and privacy concern (cs.CR). The paper uses deep learning models to tackle the problem, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the need for more effective and robust models, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
