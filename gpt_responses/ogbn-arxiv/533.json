The applications mentioned in the paper (optical flow estimation, Poisson-Gaussian denoising, and 3D surface reconstruction) are all related to computer vision and image processing, suggesting that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of gradient linearization is a key aspect of the proposed method, which may also suggest a connection to optimization (cs.NE) or information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper is focused on practical applications and empirical evaluation, which is a common theme in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
