It could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as deep neural networks are widely used in computer vision applications. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as neural networks are a fundamental component of AI. The paper's focus on the optimization of neural networks also makes it relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
