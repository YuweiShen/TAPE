Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves propositional logic and set theory, which are topics covered in cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The algorithms presented in the paper involve elimination and minimization, which are common techniques in data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with propositional CNFs, which are a type of formal language, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
