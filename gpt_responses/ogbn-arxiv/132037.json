The use of beamforming and single-user detection techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents theoretical results on the achievable rate region, which may be of interest to researchers in the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
