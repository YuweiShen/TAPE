The paper also discusses the use of relational conditional independence (RCI) oracle, which is a concept in databases (cs.DB) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes a method for conducting conditional independence tests against relational data, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
