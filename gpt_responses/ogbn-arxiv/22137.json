The method is specifically aimed at solving problems that require cooperation among agents, which suggests the category of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the privacy model used by agents, which could be categorized under Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The planning model used in FMAP is a partial-order planner, which falls under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the heuristic function used in FMAP, which could be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
