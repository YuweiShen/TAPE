Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of information transmission and processing, is the most likely category. The paper also involves designing beamformers and pilot symbols, which are related to signal processing and optimization, making cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) likely categories as well. The use of mmWave communication systems also involves high-frequency electromagnetic waves, which can be related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
