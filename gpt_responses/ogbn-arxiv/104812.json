The use of concave lower bounds and control variates are common techniques in RL, which suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with optimization, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of iterative methods and the focus on efficiency suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
