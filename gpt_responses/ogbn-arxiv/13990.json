The use of channel estimation and mismatched decoding also falls under the category of system theory (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of low-density parity-check codes, which is a topic related to networked information systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper provides bounds on the block error probability, which is a topic related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
