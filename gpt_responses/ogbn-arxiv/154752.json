It proposes a radical design that combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, using positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. The paper also presents the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 2-bit elements. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control), as they are all related to wireless communication and networking. Additionally, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.EM (Electromagnetism) are also possible sub-categories, as they are related to antenna design and electromagnetic surface."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
