This falls under the category of Embedded Systems (cs.ET) and Cybersecurity (cs.CR), as well as potentially Augmented Reality (cs.AR) due to the use of 3D integration. Additionally, the paper involves VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design and manufacturing, which is a subfield of computer engineering and computer science (cs.VLSI). Finally, the paper also discusses the development of a security-driven CAD and manufacturing flow, which falls under the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
