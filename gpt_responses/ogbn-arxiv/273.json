This involves decomposing the task into sub-tasks and learning reward functions local to the sub-tasks while also handling global dependencies. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves learning from demonstrations and dealing with complex tasks with delayed rewards."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
