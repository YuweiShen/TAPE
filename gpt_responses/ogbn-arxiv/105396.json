This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm is applied to Markovian Decision Problems, which are commonly studied in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions testing the proposed method in artificial domains, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
