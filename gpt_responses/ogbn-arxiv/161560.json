It introduces a higher-order probabilistic language descended from Lisp and a compositional language for custom inference strategies. The paper also describes key aspects of Venture's implementation that build on ideas from probabilistic graphical models, such as the stochastic procedure interface, probabilistic execution traces, partitions of execution histories called scaffolds, and a family of stochastic regeneration algorithms. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), programming languages (cs.PL), systems and control (cs.SY), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
