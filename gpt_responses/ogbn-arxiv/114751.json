It proposes new deep learning methods for tasks such as source detection, popularity prediction, article illustration, and geolocation of articles. The paper also introduces a new dataset, BreakingNews, which includes images, text, captions, and meta-data. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM) aspects, which make cs.IR and cs.MM likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper proposes new deep learning methods, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
