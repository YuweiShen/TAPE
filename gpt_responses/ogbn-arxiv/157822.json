The use of stochastic calculus suggests a focus on stochastic processes and modeling, which could also place the paper in the cs.SI (Systems and Control) sub-category. The use of auxiliary random variables suggests a potential connection to network information theory, which could place the paper in the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The use of formulae and computation suggests a potential connection to numerical analysis, which could place the paper in the cs.MA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category. Finally, the study of broadcast and wiretap channels suggests a potential connection to control theory and security, which could place the paper in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
