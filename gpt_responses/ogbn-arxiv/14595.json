The paper also discusses the use of the model for designing appropriate size of energy storage devices, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) for energy optimization. Additionally, the paper discusses the inter-temporal dependency of solar irradiance, which is relevant to the field of electrical engineering (cs.ET) for power system analysis.
