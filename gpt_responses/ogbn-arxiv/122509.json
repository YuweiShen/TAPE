The proposed solution involves deep learning techniques for volumetric grid recovery and orthographic texture view synthesis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also deals with the problem of self-occlusions caused by complex body poses and shapes, clothing obstructions, lack of surface texture, background clutter, sparse set of cameras with non-overlapping fields of view, etc. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nThe paper proposes to co-learn the depth information readily available with affordable RGBD sensors (e.g., Kinect) while showing multiple views of the same object during the training phase. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
