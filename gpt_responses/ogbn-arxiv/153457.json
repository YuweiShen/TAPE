It may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it involves integer programming. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as boosting is a popular technique in AI. The paper also mentions classification, which suggests it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's focus on real-world practicability suggests it could be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
