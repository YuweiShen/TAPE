The paper focuses on correcting multipath errors in the ranging process, which is a common problem in ground-deployed scenarios or indoor applications. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a scheme to estimate each channel's multipath profile, which is then used to correct corresponding errors in phase measurements. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) or Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
