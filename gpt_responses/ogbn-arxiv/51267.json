However, the focus of the paper is on the software tool, rather than the hardware architecture. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions the use of a custom, high-level language for implementing recovery strategies, which is related to programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
