It uses name ethnicity classification as an indicator of ethnicity and analyzes the population size, publication contribution, and collaboration strength of computer science scholars. The paper also explores the evolution of name ethnicity from 1936 to 2010 and how it shapes the formation of coauthorship and research communities. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks), cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
