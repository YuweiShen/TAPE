It could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it involves point-cloud matching and pose estimation. The use of non-linear optimization methods suggests that it could also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the fusion of LiDAR and IMU sensors for ego-motion estimation is a common problem in the field of Autonomous Systems (cs.SY), making it a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
