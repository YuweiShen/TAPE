This falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a new algorithm for computing the Truncated Fourier Transform (tft) and heavily illustrates the presentation to make it accessible to a broader audience. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the Truncated Fourier Transform (tft) which is used in signal processing and information theory. \n- cs.SD (Sound): The Truncated Fourier Transform (tft) is used in sound processing and analysis, which falls under the scope of sound in computer science. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper mentions Joris van der Hoeven, who is known for his work in symbolic computation. The Truncated Fourier Transform (tft) is also used in symbolic computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
