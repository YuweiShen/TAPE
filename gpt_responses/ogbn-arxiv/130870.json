The paper also introduces a novel metric for evaluating the generated captions, which focuses on the subject, predicate, object, and product name, indicating a natural language processing (NLP) component (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural network architecture and multi-task learning, indicating a machine learning (ML) component (cs.MM, cs.LG).
