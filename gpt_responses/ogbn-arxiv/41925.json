The paper also emphasizes the need for decentralized and customer-friendly allocation schemes. Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Cybersecurity and Privacy (cs.CY) are also possible categories, as they may involve similar allocation problems in crowdsourcing systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
