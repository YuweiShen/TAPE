The use of temporal properties of nodes, links, and their groups also suggests a connection to social dynamics (cs.SD) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the study of evolution in bibliographic networks can be seen as a problem in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
