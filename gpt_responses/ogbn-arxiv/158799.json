This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with channel estimation in a wireless communication system, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a distributed orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for efficient channel estimation, which involves collaboration between different nodes in the network. This falls under the scope of social and information networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with channel estimation in a broadband communication system, which is a key aspect of multimedia communication. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a solution for channel estimation in a complex system involving multiple nodes and large-scale arrays, which falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
