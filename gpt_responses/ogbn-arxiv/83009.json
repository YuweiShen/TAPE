This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of 3D and 2D CNNs, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper mentions the reduction of model complexity, which is a topic often studied in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with remote sensing datasets, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
