As such, it is likely to fall under the categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of approximate computing techniques, which could also place it under the categories of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET) and Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
