However, the paper also touches on reproducibility and best practices for publishing code, which could place it in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of data processing scripts and configuration also suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper mentions the reward structure for publishing code, which could relate to Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
