This involves resolving occlusions locally while preserving the overall geometric context. The paper also presents three challenging use cases, which are related to computer graphics (cs.GR), computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), computational geometry (cs.CG), and biomedical imaging (cs.BI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.GR, cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.CG, and cs.BI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
