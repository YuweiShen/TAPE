This paper deals with the task of summarizing non-factoid Community Question Answering (CQA) forums such as Quora and Stackoverflow. It involves creating a large annotated dataset for CQA summarization, comparing popular multi-document summarization techniques, and introducing a new MDS called OpinioSumm. The paper deals with natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
