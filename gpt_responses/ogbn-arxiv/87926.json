This problem is addressed using deep reinforcement learning of marked temporal point processes. The paper proposes a flexible policy gradient method that embeds the agent's actions and feedback into real-valued vectors using deep recurrent neural networks. The methodology is applied to two different applications in personalized teaching and viral marketing using data gathered from Duolingo and Twitter. Given the focus on deep reinforcement learning and the use of neural networks, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with the problem of designing interventions, which suggests a focus on Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The use of temporal point processes suggests a possible fit with Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and the focus on applications in personalized teaching and viral marketing suggests a possible fit with Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
