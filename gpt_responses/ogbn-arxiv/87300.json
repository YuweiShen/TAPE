This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses practical aspects of building web applications, such as network communication and compatibility with common APIs, which could also place it in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The distributed nature of web applications could also make it relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper may also be relevant to the Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-category, as it discusses the implementation of a new programming language for web applications. Finally, the use of functional reactive programming suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
