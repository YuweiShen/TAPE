The paper also proposes a new method for addressing the dilemma between translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in object detection, which involves designing position-sensitive score maps. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Residual Networks (ResNets) for object detection, which is a type of neural network architecture that is commonly used in deep learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the PASCAL VOC datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
