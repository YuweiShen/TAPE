This involves modeling the waiting time of passengers using a quadratic Boolean function, which is shown to be submodular. The paper also uses a greedy algorithm to maximize the submodular objective function and derives provable guarantees on the optimality of the solution. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves optimization and control aspects, which make cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely category. Additionally, the use of a submodular function and a greedy algorithm suggest relevance to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
