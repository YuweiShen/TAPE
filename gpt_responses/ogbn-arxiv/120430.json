The use of crowdsourcing for obtaining labels also suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also mentions the TREC evaluation, which is a well-known information retrieval (cs.IR) evaluation forum. Finally, the paper discusses the use of metrics for evaluating classifiers, which could be relevant to cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
