This involves data grouping, machine learning prediction, and sampling. The paper does not focus on a specific application area, but rather on a general approach to analyzing uncertainty in big spatial data. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are those related to data management (cs.DB), distributed and parallel computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
