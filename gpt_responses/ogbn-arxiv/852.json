The paper also discusses multi-core scalability and compression algorithms, which are relevant to parallel computing (cs.PL). The tree-based compression method presented in the paper involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and the experiments involve software engineering aspects such as implementation and performance evaluation (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for compressing large states to a small constant, which is related to data compression (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
