Additionally, the focus is on detecting and tracking small flying objects, which suggests robotics (cs.RO) as another likely sub-category. The use of recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks for learning motion patterns suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a possible sub-category. The paper also involves training a single, end-to-end network, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of datasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects suggests multimedia (cs.MM) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
