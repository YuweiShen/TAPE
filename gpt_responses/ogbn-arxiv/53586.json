Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. The paper also focuses on supervised learning and classification tasks, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed approach on image classification datasets, indicating that it could belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category. The paper also discusses the potential for custom hardware implementation, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper's title mentions \"Deep Supervised Learning,\" which suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
