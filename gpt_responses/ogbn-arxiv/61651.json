The paper focuses on the quantization of DNNs to produce low-precision models for efficient inference of fixed-point operations. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses weight pruning and compression, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
