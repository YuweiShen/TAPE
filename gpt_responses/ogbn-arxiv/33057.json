The paper also discusses the challenges of few-shot learning and meta-learning, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method also involves generating class-specific codes, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for deployment on embedded devices, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
