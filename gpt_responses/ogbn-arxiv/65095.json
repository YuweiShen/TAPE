The proposed algorithm, BIT*, is a sampling-based planner that uses heuristics and dynamic programming principles, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of the implicit random geometric graph (RGG) representation, which is a common tool in control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the simulations involve problems in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}^8$, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
