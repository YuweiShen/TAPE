It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as argument mining is a core technology for automating argument search in large document collections. Additionally, the use of attention-based neural networks suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Finally, the annotation scheme used in the paper could also make it relevant to the cs.CY (Computers and Society) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
