The model is applied to wireless networks, which suggests that it is also likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. The paper also discusses QoS demands and channel conditions, which suggests that it may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. The paper also discusses self-organizing and distributed channel selections, which suggests that it may belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) category.
