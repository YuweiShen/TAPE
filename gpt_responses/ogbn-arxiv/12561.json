The paper also discusses constructing a corpus-based vector space, which involves machine learning techniques and falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with comparing meanings of sentences, which involves similarity measures and falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a concrete method for implementing the linear meaning map, which involves structured vector spaces and falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
