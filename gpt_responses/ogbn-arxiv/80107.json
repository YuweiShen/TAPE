The use of RNN-based iterative neural networks for reasoning suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's focus on symbolic logic and logical reasoning suggests that it may also fall under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
