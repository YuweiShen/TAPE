The paper proposes a new polynomial-time estimator that is optimal in the number of batches and achieves the best possible estimation accuracy. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
