The paper also proposes a new operator for fusing spatial and temporal information, which involves learning a differentiable interlacing target, indicating that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on several benchmarks, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) domain. Finally, the paper mentions that the proposed method reduces latency, which suggests that the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
