This involves generating positive and negative samples of seen categories in an unsupervised manner, and then learning to distinguish seen from unseen categories in a supervised manner. This approach is commonly used in machine learning and falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, since the paper focuses on image classification, the first two sub-categories are the most likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
