The paper also discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) and transfer learning, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves image processing and computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to map image pixels to action outputs. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on real robotic tasks, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
