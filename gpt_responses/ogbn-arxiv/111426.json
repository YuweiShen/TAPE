The paper proposes a new architecture for CNNs that is specifically designed to handle spectral variations in speech signals. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (sound), which deals with speech and audio processing. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a popular technique in computer vision. Therefore, cs.CL (computer vision and pattern recognition) is another likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques to improve speech recognition accuracy, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (ML).
