The paper proposes new local estimators of ID based on linear separability of data points, which is related to concentration of measure. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
