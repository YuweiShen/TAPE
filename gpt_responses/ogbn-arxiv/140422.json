The paper also proposes a new mechanism that discards a fraction of allocated resources to incentivize truthful reporting, which involves optimization and decision-making (cs.AI). The paper also discusses approximation guarantees, which is a common topic in algorithmic game theory (cs.EC). The paper also involves mathematical proofs and analysis, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS).
