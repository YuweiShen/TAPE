Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also possible sub-categories since the paper deals with text recognition and text tracking. cs.MM (Multimedia) is another possible sub-category since the paper deals with video data. Finally, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is a possible sub-category since the paper proposes an end-to-end trainable module."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
