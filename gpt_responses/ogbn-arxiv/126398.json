Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses evaluation measures for text-based image retrieval and image captioning, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a new task called Binary Image SelectiON (BISON), which focuses on the system's ability to understand fine-grained visual structure, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
