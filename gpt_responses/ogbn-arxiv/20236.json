The scheme is based on a piecewise linear dG discretization supplemented with an artificial diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the troublesome areas. The paper also provides a theoretical numerical analysis of the proposed schemes. \n2. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a new numerical scheme for solving transport and convection-diffusion problems with implicit time integration. The scheme is based on a piecewise linear dG discretization supplemented with an artificial diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the troublesome areas. The paper also provides a smoothed (twice differentiable) version of the nonlinear stabilization, which allows us to use Newton with line search nonlinear solvers and dramatically improve nonlinear convergence. \n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a new numerical scheme for solving transport and convection-diffusion problems with implicit time integration. The scheme is based on a piecewise linear dG discretization supplemented with an artificial diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the troublesome areas. The paper also provides a set of numerical results to support the proposed scheme. \n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
