It proves a Pumping Lemma and an impossibility result for precisely controlled growth of computationally-defined shapes. These topics are closely related to theoretical computer science, discrete mathematics, computational geometry, and complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.THEORY, followed by cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
