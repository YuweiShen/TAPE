This involves using a self-supervised inverse dynamics model and the framework of Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA) to simultaneously learn many directed exploration policies with the same neural network. The paper also discusses the potential for incorporating the proposed method into modern distributed RL agents. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper uses Atari-57 games as a benchmark, which suggests a potential fit with cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
