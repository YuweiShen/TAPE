The method is evaluated on image classification and detection tasks, indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also introduces a weight balanced binarization technique and a gated residual to compensate for information loss, suggesting a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a generic network module that can be applied to various network architectures, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
