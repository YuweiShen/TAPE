The use of ultra-wideband millimeter-wave measurements and channel sounders also suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and augmented reality (cs.AR) applications. Additionally, the paper discusses the generation of path loss models using directional power delay profiles, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.MA) for signal processing and feature extraction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
