The paper also focuses on optimizing energy efficiency, which is a concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed methodology involves a hierarchical classification framework, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve the use of image datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
