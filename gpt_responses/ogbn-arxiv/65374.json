It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a novel deep network architecture to improve accuracy and reduce inference time. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it discusses the use of deep neural networks and their limitations. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it discusses the use of side branch classifiers to improve performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
