This topic is closely related to logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), and formal methods (cs.SE). The paper also discusses improvements to the implementation of the theory, which could fall under categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) or formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
