This involves using high-frequency information from the source contrast and undersampled acquisitions of the target contrast to preserve details and prevent feature leakage or loss. This approach is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) techniques for image synthesis and reconstruction. The use of MRI data also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the use of generative adversarial networks is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
