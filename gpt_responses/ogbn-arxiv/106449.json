This involves computer vision techniques such as feature extraction and matching, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods and proposes a new method, which involves designing a sloped funnel lane to overcome these limitations. This involves designing a control system, which is commonly studied in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.RO, cs.CV, and cs.AI, followed by cs.LG and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
