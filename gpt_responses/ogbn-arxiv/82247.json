The use of heuristics and formal results in the literature suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with querying data. Finally, the empirical verification of the heuristics and the focus on optimizing queries for RDF stores suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
