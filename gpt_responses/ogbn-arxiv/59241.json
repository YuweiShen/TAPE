It could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category as it proposes a new algorithm for improving RL. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it experiments on the Cartpole problem, which is a classic control problem in robotics. The paper also deals with control systems (cs.SY) as it proposes a new algorithm for stabilizing greediness in RL. Finally, the paper involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it combines CPI with deep RL using neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
