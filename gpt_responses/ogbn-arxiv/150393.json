Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a new method for transfer learning, which involves optimization procedures, suggesting that it may also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the properties of data scheduled by the co-curriculum, which could be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of EM-style optimization may also suggest a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
