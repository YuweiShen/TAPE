The use of system identification techniques to build the model further supports this category.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of computational fluid dynamics simulations to generate training data for the model, which falls under the purview of computational engineering. \n- cs.FL (Fluid Dynamics): The paper deals with the flow-induced vibration of a bluff body in a fluid flow, which is a problem of interest to fluid dynamicists. The use of CFD simulations to generate training data further supports this category.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper deals with the flow-induced vibration of a bluff body, which is a problem of interest to mechanical engineers.
