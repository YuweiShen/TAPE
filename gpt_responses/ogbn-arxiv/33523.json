The descriptor captures spatio-temporal distribution of events, which is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.RO). The proposed descriptor is also used as local features in a bag-of-features classification framework, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
