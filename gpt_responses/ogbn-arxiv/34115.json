The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.SY (Systems and Control), which deals with the analysis and control of complex systems. The paper also involves aspects of logic (cs.LO) in the definition of delta-reachability, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the probabilistic version of delta-reachability, programming languages (cs.PL) in the implementation of ProbReach, and robotics (cs.RO) in the benchmarks involving non-linear hybrid systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
