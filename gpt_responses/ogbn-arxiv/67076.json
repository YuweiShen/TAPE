The paper also discusses the use of a training curriculum, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper specifically focuses on board games, which falls under game theory (cs.GT). The use of a structured training curriculum also involves optimizing the learning process, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the training curriculum to an AlphaZero-inspired player, which involves robotics and control (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
