Additionally, the paper discusses the use of pre-trained models and fine-tuning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of loss functions, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the improvement of network robustness, which is a topic that falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
