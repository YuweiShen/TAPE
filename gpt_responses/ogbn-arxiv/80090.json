Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the network's performance and optimization, which suggests that it could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of MobileNetV2 and contractive bottleneck blocks also suggests a focus on neural networks, which could place it under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the deployment of the network in mobile and embedded systems, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
