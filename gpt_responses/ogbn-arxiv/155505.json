The proposed method involves a Conditional Gating Module (CGM) that determines the use of each residual block, which is a technique that can be applied to various types of neural networks and therefore could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve image classification on ImageNet, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
