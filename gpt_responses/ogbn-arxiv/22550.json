The use of minimum storage regenerating codes and interference alignment schemes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on minimizing repair bandwidth and optimizing efficiency suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
