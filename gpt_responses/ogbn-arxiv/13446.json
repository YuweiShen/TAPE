The use of relative entropy and R\\'enyi divergences also suggests a possible connection to data science (cs.DS) and statistics (cs.MS). Finally, the focus on stationary finite state Markov chains and spectral radius may indicate a potential overlap with systems and control theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
