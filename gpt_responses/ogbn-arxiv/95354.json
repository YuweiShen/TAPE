The use of logical theories and query reformulation also relates to logic (cs.LO). The paper specifically employs methods and results from Boolean circuit complexity (cs.CC) to analyze the size of query reformulation. Finally, the use of algorithms and data structures to optimize query answering may also relate to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
