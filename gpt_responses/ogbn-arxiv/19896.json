The paper proposes a joint iterative optimization strategy for the design of the reduced-rank beamformer, which involves adjusting the parameters of a rank-reduction matrix, a reduced-rank beamformer, and diagonal loading in an alternating manner. This optimization strategy involves stochastic gradient and recursive least-squares adaptive algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SI (Signal Processing), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
