This suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves human studies, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of computational models also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
