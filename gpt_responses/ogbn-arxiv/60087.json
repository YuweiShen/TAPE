The paper proposes a segmentation procedure to extract individual events of specific length and expressive features to accomplish a qualitative motion assessment by supervised classification. The study was conducted on athletes undertaking different body weight exercises. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the development of a concept for qualitative assessment of recurrent human motion, which involves the interaction between humans and technology. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a supervised classification approach to accomplish a qualitative motion assessment, which involves the use of machine learning techniques. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with the processing of multi-dimensional, continuous time series tracked with motion sensors, which involves computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a supervised classification approach to accomplish a qualitative motion assessment, which involves the use of neural networks. \n- cs.SD (Sound): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with sound, the proposed approach could potentially be extended to include sound-based features for motion assessment, which involves the use of sound processing techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
