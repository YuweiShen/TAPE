The paper evaluates the degree to which saliency maps represent the semantics of RL environments using counterfactual analysis. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
