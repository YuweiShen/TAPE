The paper also discusses the use of mixed-supervised learning and multi-task learning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on medical image datasets, which are typically associated with multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes the use of a novel architecture and a recent technique called \"Squeeze and Excitation,\" which are related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
