Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of antenna arrays with hundreds or thousands of active elements, which falls under the category of Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of power control and pilot reuse, which are common topics in Communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
