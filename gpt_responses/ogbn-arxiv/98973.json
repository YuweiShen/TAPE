Hence, cs.LG is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with developing an adaptive emotion recognition system, which involves the use of AI techniques. Therefore, cs.AI is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the practical applications of speech emotion recognition, which can be used in social and information networks. Hence, cs.SI is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
