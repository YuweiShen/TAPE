It focuses on the implementation of an internal Scala DSL and the use of Scala typing to verify DSL integrity. These topics are most closely related to programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of parboiled2 in parsing natural language, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL), and the use of parboiled2 in testing HTTP JSON APIs, which is related to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
