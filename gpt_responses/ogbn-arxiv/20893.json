It involves the use of citation-based recursive ranking methods to identify emerging technology trends. The paper also discusses the dynamics of citations from different precursor classes, which can help predict future technological developments. This work involves techniques from information retrieval, data mining, and network analysis, which are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
