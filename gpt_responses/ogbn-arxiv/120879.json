This involves natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques, which are commonly associated with the arXiv sub-categories cs.CL and cs.CV. Additionally, the paper introduces an automatic method for testing the performance of pragmatic speaker models, which could fall under the sub-categories cs.AI (artificial intelligence) or cs.LG (machine learning). Finally, the paper also discusses efficiency in the implementation of RSA, which could relate to the sub-category cs.SD (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
