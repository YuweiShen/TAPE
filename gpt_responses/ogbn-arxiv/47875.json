The use of subresultants and discriminants suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of symbolic computation (cs.SC). The paper also mentions the challenge of certifying the topology of singular curves, which may involve the study of singularities (cs.SY) and algebraic geometry (cs.AG). Overall, cs.SC and cs.NA seem to be the most likely categories, followed by cs.CG, cs.GC, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
