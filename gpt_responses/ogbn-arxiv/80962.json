These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning (cs.DL) for feature extraction, and the evaluation of the system's usability (cs.HC). Finally, the paper presents a novel dataset of manga images (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
