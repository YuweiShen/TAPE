Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the embedding of hybrid type-logical grammars into first-order linear logic, which falls under the category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also touches upon the problems with lambda grammars/abstract categorial grammars, which are related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the syntax-semantics interface, which is related to cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
