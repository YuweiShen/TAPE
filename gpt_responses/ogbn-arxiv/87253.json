The use of integer-forcing (IF) precoding and lattice-reduction-aided (LRA) precoding also suggests the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The proposed low-complexity method for finding good parameters for the RDIF scheme may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
