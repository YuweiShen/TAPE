This falls under the domain of parallel computing, which is a subfield of distributed computing. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): String matching algorithms are a fundamental topic in data structures and algorithms. The paper proposes a modified version of the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which is a well-known string matching algorithm. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) for parallel processing on GPUs. CUDA is a programming language developed by NVIDIA for parallel computing on GPUs. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper focuses on the use of GPUs for parallel processing, which falls under the domain of hardware architecture. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of GPUs for scientific computation, which is a subfield of computational engineering, finance, and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
