The proposed method involves sparse representation modeling and dictionary learning, which are techniques commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of Gaussian mixture models, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI).
