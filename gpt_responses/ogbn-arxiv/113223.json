As such, it is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computer vision (cs.CV), robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper's focus on improving transfer learning between simulators and generalizing to unseen environments suggests that it may be particularly relevant to the computer vision and robotics sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
