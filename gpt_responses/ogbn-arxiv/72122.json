The paper also uses a deep visual perception model, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category. Additionally, the paper involves training a custom convolutional neural network architecture, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the paper deals with feedback controllers to enforce safety-critical constraints, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
