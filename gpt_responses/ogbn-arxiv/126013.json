The model is inspired by standard autoregressive (AR) models and gating mechanisms used in recurrent neural networks. The architecture was designed for applications on asynchronous time series and is evaluated on such datasets: a hedge fund proprietary dataset of over 2 million quotes for a credit derivative index, an artificially generated noisy autoregressive series and UCI household electricity consumption dataset. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
