Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep mixture models, which is a common machine learning model for clustering and classification tasks. \n\nThe paper also mentions the modeling of discrete structures, which suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category, as modeling discrete structures is a common problem in AI. \n\nThe mention of modeling symmetries in data distributions suggests that the paper could also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category, as symmetries are often used in image processing and computer vision tasks. \n\nThe use of locally invertible functions for domain partitioning suggests that the paper could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category, as neural networks often use invertible functions for data transformation. \n\nFinally, the mention of modeling both continuous and discrete structures suggests that the paper could also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category, as modeling hybrid systems with both continuous and discrete components is a common problem in control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
