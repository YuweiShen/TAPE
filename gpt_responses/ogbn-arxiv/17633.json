The mention of homotopy type theory and (\u221e, 1)-categories suggests that the paper may belong to the Logic (cs.LO) or Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The mention of a semantic framework and type formers suggests that the paper may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories.
