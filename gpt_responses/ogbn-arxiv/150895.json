The paper also mentions the use of lattice decoding, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel algorithm, which involves combining different search strategies, and this could potentially fall under the Machine Learning (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance and complexity of the proposed algorithm, which could be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
