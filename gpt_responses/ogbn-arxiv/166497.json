The proposed method involves developing a new loss function, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using interior-point methods, which is a technique commonly used in optimization and numerical analysis (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on the COCO dataset, which is a popular benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
