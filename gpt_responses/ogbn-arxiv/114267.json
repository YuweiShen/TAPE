Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel approach for connecting task-specific CNNs, which involves deep collaboration and skip connections, indicating that it may fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions recent advances in deep learning, suggesting that it may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper uses facial landmark detection datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia applications, indicating that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
