This involves analyzing the relay function and formulating an optimization problem to maximize the signal to distortion-plus-noise ratio under relay and source transmit power constraints. The problem complexity is addressed by proposing a gradient-projection-based (GP) algorithm and a non-alternating sub-optimal solution. The paper also discusses the impact of hardware impairments on system performance. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
