It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as bootstrapping is a common technique in AI research. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as bootstrapping is a statistical method that involves resampling data. The paper's focus on large-scale learning suggests it could also be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as these fields often deal with large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
