The paper proposes a new algorithm for NMF, which is based on the notion of subset-separability. This algorithm is shown to be provably correct and efficient, and is also robust to small noise. The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithm on simulations and compares it to state-of-the-art methods. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
