The focus is on the development of a system that allows robots to implicitly communicate through their actions, rather than through explicit messaging. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), systems and control (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
