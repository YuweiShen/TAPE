This involves using unconventional approaches, which could fall under the categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the performance of the codec in terms of video quality, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses how Daala fits into the newly created AV1 codec, which could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
