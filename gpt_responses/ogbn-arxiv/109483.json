This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DS). The paper also involves the lifting of codes, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper discusses the error correction capabilities of the constructed codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
