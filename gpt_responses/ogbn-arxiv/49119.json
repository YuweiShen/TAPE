Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of ResNeXt blocks, which are commonly used in deep learning for image classification, indicating that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of parameters to reduce computational cost, which could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with remote sensing and land-cover classification, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
