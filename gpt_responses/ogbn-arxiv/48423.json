The paper presents new algorithms and conditional lower bounds for this problem, which suggests that it belongs to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of metric spaces and norms, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-categories. The use of algorithms and complexity analysis suggests that it could belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category. Finally, the mention of Hausdorff and Fr\\'echet distances suggests that it could belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
