The use of probabilistic methods and analysis of algorithms also suggests that it could belong to the data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The mention of rescaling and distance-like functions suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the mention of \"complexity of approximations\" suggests that the paper could also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
