The use of almost Gaussian random vectors and almost linearly dependent random vectors suggests a focus on signal processing and statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also mentions optimization techniques, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) or optimization and control (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
