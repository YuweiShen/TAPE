Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The use of 360-degree cameras also suggests that the paper could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), while the re-training of a face detector for this purpose could be considered a machine learning task, placing it under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of vision sensors also suggests that the paper could fall under cs.RO (Robotics and Control). Finally, the paper's focus on face detection could place it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
