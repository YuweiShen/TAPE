Additionally, the paper discusses the issue of bias in AI, which is a topic that falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also proposes a framework that leverages Bayesian parameter search, which is a technique commonly used in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category.
