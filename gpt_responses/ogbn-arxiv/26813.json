This optimization problem can be formulated as a nonconvex QCQP, which requires advanced signal processing techniques such as SDR and time-sharing. Information theory plays a crucial role in analyzing the achievable rate region and characterizing the multiuser power region. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper also involves the design and analysis of a complex system, namely a MIMO WPT system with multiple TXs and RXs, which requires the integration of various subsystems such as power electronics, magnetic resonators, and signal processing algorithms. The optimization of magnetic beamforming involves the control of the TXs' current allocation to achieve the desired power transfer performance while satisfying the constraints on peak voltage and current. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper may also be relevant to the multimedia community, as wireless power transfer is becoming increasingly important for various multimedia applications such as wireless charging of mobile devices, smart homes, and electric vehicles. The optimization of magnetic beamforming can improve the power transfer efficiency and reduce the charging time, which is critical for user experience and convenience. \n4. cs.EM (Electromagnetics"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
