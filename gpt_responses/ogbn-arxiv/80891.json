The paper also discusses the usefulness of feedback and delayed CSI for the MIMO X-channel, which involves networked communication (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the K-user X-channel, which involves multiple users and messages, and hence falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
