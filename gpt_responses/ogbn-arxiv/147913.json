The paper introduces a new criterion called resilience, which allows for robust computation of properties of a dataset even in the presence of a large fraction of arbitrary additional data. This makes it relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) as well as information theory (cs.IT) which deals with robustness and error correction. The paper also provides new algorithmic results on robust distribution learning and robust mean estimation, which makes it relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on robustness and resilience makes it relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI) which often deal with noisy and unreliable data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
