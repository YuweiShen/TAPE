The paper proposes a new method for image matching using adaptive convolutions, which involves constructing convolution kernels on the fly, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the generalizability of the proposed method to handle various unseen scenarios, which is a topic commonly studied in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) field. Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on the person re-identification task, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
