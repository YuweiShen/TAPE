This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the MPEG standard Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), which falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The evaluation methodology described in the paper can also be used to evaluate any other/new adaptation logic, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
