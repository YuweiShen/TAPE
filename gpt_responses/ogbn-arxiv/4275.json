This involves designing an algorithm to replace the VN update rule of the standard min-sum (MS) decoder with lookup tables, which are designed in a way that maximizes the mutual information between decoding messages. The paper also discusses a custom pseudo-hierarchical backend design strategy to further alleviate routing congestions and to handle the large design. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.ET (Embedded Systems), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.EM (Electronic Markets)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
