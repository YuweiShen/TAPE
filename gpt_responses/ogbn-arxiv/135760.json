The proposed method involves the formulation of a new loss function and the use of a hierarchical tree structure to collect informative training samples, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the method is based on benchmarks commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
