This falls under the category of cybersecurity (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY). The proposed algorithm uses dynamic watermarking, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for data protection. The framework is practically implementable, which involves software updates, making it relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with power systems, which can be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
