This involves image processing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition, which are all relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The method also involves training the networks using fingerprint datasets, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of precision and recall, which are metrics commonly used in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the potential use of the proposed method in fingerprint individuality evaluation, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
