Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also involves complexity classes such as $\\mathcal{NP}$ and $\\mathcal{PSPACE}$, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of natural deduction formalisms and the mention of intuitionistic and classical formalisms suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
