The paper also discusses finite-context models (FCMs) and introduces a generalization of FCMs, called extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCM), which calculates the probability of occurrence of the next d symbols, given the previous k symbols. These topics are closely related to information theory. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of FCMs and xaFCMs in different applications, such as ECG biometric identification and DNA sequence similarity estimation. These applications involve machine learning techniques, such as pattern recognition and classification. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the memory and computational time requirements of FCMs and xaFCMs. This topic is related to data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the use of NRC in biometric identification, which is a security-related application. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of FCMs and xaFCMs in different applications, such as ECG biometric identification and DNA sequence similarity estimation. These applications involve artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
