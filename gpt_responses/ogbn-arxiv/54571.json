This involves analyzing large-scale social network datasets, modeling edge prediction as an outlier detection problem, and evaluating the proposed approach against previous methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
