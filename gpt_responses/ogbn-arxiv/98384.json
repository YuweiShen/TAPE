The use of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm and end-to-end approach suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The fact that the robot operates in partially observable environments indicates the involvement of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the potential applications of the research in search and rescue situations suggest the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
