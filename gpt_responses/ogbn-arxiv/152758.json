It could also belong to robotics (cs.RO) as it is related to automated driving systems and path planning. Machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE) are also likely sub-categories as the paper proposes a new network layer and uses recurrent neural networks for image processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
