The paper proposes three BERT-based models for WSD and fine-tunes the pre-trained BERT model on SemCor3.0 training corpus. The paper falls under the category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also involves the use of AI techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
