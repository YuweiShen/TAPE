The paper also involves the analysis of bounds and characterizations of common information, which could fall under cs.CC (computational complexity) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms). The extension of common information to sources with continuous alphabets could also relate to cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.SI (signal processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
