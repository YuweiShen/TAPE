The paper also uses techniques from parameterized complexity, which is a subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC). The problem of computing rotation distance is closely related to problems in computational geometry, such as computing the edit distance between two planar graphs, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also uses techniques from graph theory and combinatorics, which are relevant to the subcategories of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
