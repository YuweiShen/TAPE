The use of a robot to trawl the web for full-texts and the analysis of citation data suggest a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The mention of subfields with high levels of open access, such as physics, may also suggest a focus on cybernetics (cs.CY) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper's interdisciplinary approach and focus on research impact may suggest a focus on social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
