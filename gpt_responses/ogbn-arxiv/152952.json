The paper specifically focuses on median-based algorithms, which can be seen as a form of robust optimization, and their performance in the presence of heterogeneous data. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) and \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT), which deal with issues related to distributed computation and communication. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel gradient correction mechanism that involves adding noise to the local gradients, which is a technique that is commonly used in the field of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) to improve the robustness of machine learning models. Finally, the paper also discusses the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms, which is a topic that falls under the category of \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
