This suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also involves set-intersection and distance oracle problems, which are common topics in the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The use of graphs and their properties also suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category.
