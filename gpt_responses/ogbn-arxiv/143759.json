The use of algebraic geometry codes is a specific technique within coding theory, which makes cs.CC a likely category. The paper also discusses the security properties of the schemes, which could fall under the sub-categories of distributed systems (cs.DS) or security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
