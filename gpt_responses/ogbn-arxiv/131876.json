Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. However, it also involves communication systems (cs.COMM) and signal processing (cs.SI) aspects. Additionally, the paper proposes precoding methods that optimize virtual MMSE and mutual information, which are related to network information theory (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
