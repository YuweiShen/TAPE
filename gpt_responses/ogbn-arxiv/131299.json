The study also involves evaluating the effect of JPG compression on the classification of adversarial images, which falls under the category of image compression (cs.MM) and potentially computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the use of adversarial images and their impact on neural networks is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
