The paper also proposes a new transmission framework and upper bound for DoF, which involves network coding and signal processing techniques, making it relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could fall under the computer engineering (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of multiple antennas, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
