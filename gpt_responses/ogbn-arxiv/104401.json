It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category as it discusses the use of deep neural networks for classification. Multimedia (cs.MM) is another possible category as it deals with video data. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possibility as the paper discusses the use of adversarial attacks to fool video classifiers. Finally, Cybersecurity (cs.CR) is a possible category as the paper discusses the vulnerability of video classifiers to adversarial attacks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
