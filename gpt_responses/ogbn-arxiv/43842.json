The paper also uses an antenna-theory-based channel model to analyze the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base station, which is a topic of interest in information theory.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of in-band full-duplex wireless communication, which is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture. The paper also analyzes the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base station, which is relevant to the design of wireless networks.\n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the design of in-band full-duplex wireless communication, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high-bandwidth and low-latency communication. The paper also analyzes the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base station, which is relevant to the design of multimedia communication systems.\n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of in-band full-duplex wireless communication, which is a topic of interest in systems and control. The paper also analyzes the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base station, which is relevant to the design of control systems that rely on wireless"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
