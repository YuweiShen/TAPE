The use of an overlay and aggregation tree suggests a focus on distributed computing, which is reflected in the cs.DC and cs.Distributed categories. The paper also mentions runtimes and algorithms, indicating a focus on data structures and algorithms, which are reflected in the cs.DS and cs.AL categories.
