This involves constructing a Structural Information of Spectrum (SIOS) through a searching algorithm to identify and analyze the harmonics of impulses generated by faults. This method involves signal processing, machine learning, and optimization techniques, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of cs.SD (Signal Processing), cs.SI (Sound and Music Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
