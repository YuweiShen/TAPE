The use of non-uniform quantization and codebooks is also a common technique in signal processing (cs.MM) and network information theory (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes low-complexity hybrid analog/digital precoding schemes, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
