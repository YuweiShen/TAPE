The paper also mentions the use of a high-level symbolic representation of the forward problem, which is related to computer algebra systems (cs.MS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the technique in a software package, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
