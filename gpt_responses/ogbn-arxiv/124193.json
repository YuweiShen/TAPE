Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes the use of BERT, a popular language model, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of detection techniques, which could relate to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
