The focus is on dealing with uncertainty and finding globally good solutions using problem-specific knowledge. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The use of nonparametric methods and the formulation of the problem as a linear program suggest that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
