The paper also discusses convergence behavior and trade-offs, which are common themes in the Learning (cs.LG) and Information Theory (cs.IT) categories. The paper's focus on mitigating the effect of stragglers suggests that it may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper's analysis of trade-offs between convergence rate, data set size, accuracy, and computational load suggests that it may also be relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
