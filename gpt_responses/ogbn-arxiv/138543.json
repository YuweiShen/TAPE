The method is applied to a specific problem of learning the past tense of English verbs, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of intensional background knowledge and avoidance of explicit negative examples suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
