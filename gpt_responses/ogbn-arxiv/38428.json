Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since the paper deals with training policy networks and improving agent performance. The use of Minecraft as the environment suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
