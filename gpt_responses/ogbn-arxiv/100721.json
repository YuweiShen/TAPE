This is a core area of research in programming languages.\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses how the static discipline of permissions in Mezzo can prevent certain mistakes and enable new idioms, which is relevant to software engineering.\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses a type system to enforce the static discipline of permissions, which is related to the use of logic in computer science.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions that the static discipline of permissions in Mezzo can prevent data races, which is a security concern.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions that Mezzo offers ways of working around the restriction of sharing a mutable data structure, which is relevant to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
