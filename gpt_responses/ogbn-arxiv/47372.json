The use of approximation algorithms and the focus on welfare maximization suggest that the paper could also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the connection to simultaneous auctions with item bidding suggests that the paper could also be relevant to cs.MA (Multiagent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
