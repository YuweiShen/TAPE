The use of expander graphs is a common technique in theoretical computer science (cs.TC) and machine learning (cs.LG), which makes these sub-categories likely as well. The paper also discusses the use of perturbations and algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
