This falls under the scope of information theory as it involves the study of communication systems and their performance metrics. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): OFDM is a signal processing technique widely used in communication systems. The paper proposes a new construction of complementary sets to improve the performance of OFDM systems. Hence, it is likely to be classified under cs.SI. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): OFDM is used in various wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G. The proposed construction of complementary sets can improve the performance of these systems, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new construction of complementary sets using generalized Boolean functions. This involves the design and analysis of algorithms for generating these sets, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of Boolean functions and the optimization of PMEPR can be related to machine learning techniques such as optimization and pattern recognition. Hence, it is possible that the paper may be classified under cs"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
