The paper focuses on improving the running time of the algorithm for graphs with maximum degree $\\Delta \\geq 4$, which suggests that it belongs to the Distributed Computing (cs.DC) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also mentions lower bounds and previous work on the topic, which indicates that it may also belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT), Network Economics (cs.NE), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
