The paper also introduces a new approach to expressing declassification policies using existential types, which is a type system concept that is often studied in the logic (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper formalizes its approach in a functional calculus, which is a topic that falls under the formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
