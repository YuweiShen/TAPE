This is a problem that is commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also introduces a learning architecture for solving this problem, which involves training inverse transport networks using stochastic gradient descent. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper introduces a physically-accurate differentiable renderer, which can be used to estimate derivatives of images with respect to physical scene parameters. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
