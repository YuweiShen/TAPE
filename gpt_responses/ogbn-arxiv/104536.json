These problems are typically studied in the computational geometry subfield, which is represented by cs.CG. The paper also uses optimization techniques, which could place it in the subfields of cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.NA (numerical analysis), or cs.DM (discrete mathematics). Finally, the paper provides an empirical evaluation, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of cs.SY (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
