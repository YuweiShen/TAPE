The proposed approach involves formulating semantic embedding as a metric learning problem, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves accurate attribute prediction, which is a problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on four challenging datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
