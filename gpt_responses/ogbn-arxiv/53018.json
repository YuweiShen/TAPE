The method uses a rolling-shutter camera, which is a specific type of camera used in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of optimization techniques and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) to improve the accuracy of the system. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a dataset, which is a common practice in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
