The paper focuses on the application of this approach to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and constrained TSP problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves the use of graph embeddings and hierarchical policies, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
