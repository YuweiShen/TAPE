The proposed method uses a lightweight network structure and anchor densification strategy, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of GPUs for faster processing, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method, which can be evaluated using metrics such as precision and recall, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
