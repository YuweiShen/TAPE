The paper proposes a novel convolutional network architecture to directly generate the sharp image. This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also deals with motion blur, which is a common problem in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of a high frame rate video camera and frame averaging also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.GR, cs.MM, cs.AI, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
