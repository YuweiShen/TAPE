The most relevant sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the retrieval of information from large collections of data. The use of Poisson processes to model the rate of relevant documents is a statistical approach, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The evaluation of the proposed method on a public dataset involves data analysis, which could also place the paper in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
