Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework, which involves optimization and decision-making processes, indicating a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also considers the sensitivity of mmWave links due to blockage, which suggests a possible connection with cs.SY (Systems and Control) as well. Finally, the paper deals with massive multiple-input multiple-output networks, which is a topic related to signal processing and wireless communication, indicating a possible fit with cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
