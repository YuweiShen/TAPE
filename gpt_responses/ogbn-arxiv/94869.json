Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also involves profiling of workloads, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.DB (Databases) as well. The use of programmable logic and integrated processing-in-memory and in-storage processing indicates the involvement of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential of NDC architecture for improving the performance of Apache Spark, which suggests the involvement of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
