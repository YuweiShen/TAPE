Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves language modeling and understanding, which suggests cs.CL (Computation and Language) as another likely sub-category. The paper also involves extensive experiments and evaluation, which suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SD (Software Engineering) as possible sub-categories.
