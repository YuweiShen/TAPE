It discusses the features of the language that support variational forms and functionals, automatic differentiation of forms and expressions, arbitrary function space hierarchies for multi-field problems, general differential operators, and flexible tensor algebra. These are all topics that fall under the scope of numerical analysis.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper presents a new language for expressing finite element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations in near-mathematical notation. It discusses the construction of the language and its implementation as an open-source software library. These are all topics that fall under the scope of mathematical software.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of the Unified Form Language (UFL) to effortlessly express finite element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations. This is a common task in computational engineering, finance, and science.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper discusses the automatic differentiation of forms and expressions in UFL. This is a topic that falls under the scope of symbolic computation.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of UFL to express finite element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations.
