The paper presents necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for matrices of arbitrary rank to be identifiable from a set of matrix entries, which is a key problem in information theory. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Matrix completion is a well-known problem in machine learning, and the paper presents new algorithms for the problem of matrix completion. The paper also evaluates the tightness of the given conditions and algorithms for practically relevant matrix sizes, which is a key problem in machine learning. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents new algorithms for the problem of matrix completion, which is a key problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper also evaluates the tightness of the given conditions and algorithms for practically relevant matrix sizes, which is a key problem in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of matrix completion, which is a key problem in social and information networks.
