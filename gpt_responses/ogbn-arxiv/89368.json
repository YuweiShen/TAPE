This suggests a strong connection to neural computing, making cs.NE the most likely category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses unsupervised learning using online clustering and hierarchical predictive coding, which are common techniques in machine learning. This suggests a connection to cs.LG.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an architecture for continual learning, which is a key area of research in AI. This suggests a connection to cs.AI.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, but the proposed architecture could potentially be applied to visual tasks. This suggests a possible connection to cs.CV.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper does not explicitly mention systems and control, but the proposed architecture involves feedforward, lateral, and feedback connections, which are common in control systems.
