This involves elements of robotics (cs.RO) in terms of the cooperative driving strategy, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in terms of the use of MCTS, machine learning (cs.LG) in terms of the heuristic rules, control systems (cs.SY) in terms of the overall system design, and computer vision (cs.CV) in terms of any visual sensing that may be used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
