The introduction of a model where bidders can be distinguished based on side information also suggests a potential connection to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the use of empirical risk minimization techniques is a common tool in the field of computational economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
