Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CV (Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of weight repetition to reduce computation and model size, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper proposes a new accelerator, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
