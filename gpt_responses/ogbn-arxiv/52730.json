The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on enhancing deep reinforcement learning models. The second likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision), as the paper proposes a new approach called \"object saliency maps\" to visually explain the actions made by deep reinforcement learning agents. The third likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper proposes a novel method to improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning models. The fourth likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), as the paper mentions the application of deep reinforcement learning in robot navigation. The fifth likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as the paper proposes a method to incorporate object recognition processing into deep reinforcement learning models using neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
