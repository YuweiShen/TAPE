This falls under the category of digital circuits (cs.DC) and architecture (cs.AR), as well as software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of C++ for FPGA-targeted code generation, which falls under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
