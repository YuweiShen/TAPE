This problem is related to the field of machine learning, specifically in the area of robust learning. The paper proposes a new formulation for distributionally robust learning that incorporates unlabeled data to further constrain the adversary. The paper also extends the formulation to active learning. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
