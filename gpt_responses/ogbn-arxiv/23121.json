The paper introduces a run-time mechanism for checking termination in a general-purpose programming language, which can be formulated as a contract. The approach combines the robustness of size-change termination with precise information available at run-time, and it can be applied using existing abstract interpretation techniques directly to the operational semantics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are programming languages (cs.PL), logic in computer science (cs.LO), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
