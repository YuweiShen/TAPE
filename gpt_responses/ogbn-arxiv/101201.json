Additionally, the use of deep learning models suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The focus on medical imaging and disease diagnosis suggests that it could also belong to the Medical Imaging (cs.MED) category. Finally, the use of multi-task learning techniques suggests that it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category, which deals with the organization and retrieval of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
