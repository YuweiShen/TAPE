The paper focuses on the physical and practical differences between these frequency bands and suggests appropriate signal processing schemes and use cases. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the hardware characteristics of mMIMO, which could fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and the use cases and signal processing schemes could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
