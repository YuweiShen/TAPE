Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also proposes a novel method for detecting adversarial examples based on the spatial behavior of activation spaces, which involves analyzing the structure of neural network layers, so it could also be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
