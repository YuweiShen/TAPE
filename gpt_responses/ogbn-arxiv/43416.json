The use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver also suggests a possible categorization in the areas of networking and communication (cs.NI, cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of separate coding over each subchannel, which is a technique used in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, which is a topic in multimedia and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
