Additionally, the paper discusses the use of reachability methods and neural network verification tools, which are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
