Additionally, the paper deals with computer vision (CV) techniques for visual feature extraction and matching. The proposed hybrid index structures also involve database (DB) techniques for efficient indexing and retrieval of images. Furthermore, multimedia (MM) techniques are used to handle the spatial and visual features of images. Finally, the paper deals with data structures (DS) for organizing and accessing the index structures efficiently. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IR, cs.CV, and cs.DB, followed by cs.MM and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
