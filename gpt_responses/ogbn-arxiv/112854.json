The use of neural networks and deep learning techniques suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also deals with security and privacy concerns, which could place it in the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of triplet networks and feature extraction suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
