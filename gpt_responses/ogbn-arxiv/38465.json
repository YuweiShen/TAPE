However, since the focus is primarily on the impact of channel estimation errors on the performance of cognitive radio networks, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the tradeoffs involved in choosing the amount of interference and guard distance, which are relevant to cs.SY. The use of MIMO radar waveform design to avoid interference with commercial communication systems, operating in same or adjacent bands, is also mentioned, which is relevant to cs.MM and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
