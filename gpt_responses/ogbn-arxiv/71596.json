The use of deep learning and augmentation techniques also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of multi-views and landmarks suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the focus on facial expressions suggests that it could belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
