The use of key frames and key segments to capture static and dynamic information respectively suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM). The use of a fully connected layer for feature selection and a convolutional layer for feature description suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for scene recognition suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
