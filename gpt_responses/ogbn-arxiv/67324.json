The paper also introduces the concept of backdoors, which is a common topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS, cs.CC). The paper uses techniques from parameterized complexity, which is a subfield of computer science that deals with the analysis of algorithms in terms of their running time as a function of some parameter (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of tractable classes of VCSP instances, which is a topic that is relevant to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
