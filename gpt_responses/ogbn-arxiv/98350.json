The use of text queries to incorporate user preferences suggests an information retrieval (IR) aspect. The proposed memory network approach involves deep learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (LG). Finally, the evaluation method proposed in the paper involves natural language processing (CL) to extract semantic information from the video. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.IR, cs.MM, cs.CL, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
