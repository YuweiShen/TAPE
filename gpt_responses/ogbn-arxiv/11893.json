This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of reliable service composition (RSC) and device-to-device (D2D) links for all-to-all broadcast communication, which involves information theory concepts such as channel coding and modulation. \n\n3. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly mentions security challenges in C-ITS and how they can be addressed using 5G technology. This falls under the scope of cryptography and security. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the requirements and challenges of C-ITS applications, which involve control systems for vehicles and road infrastructure. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly mentions security challenges in C-ITS and how they can be addressed using 5G technology.
