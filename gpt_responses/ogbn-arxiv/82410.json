The paper also discusses the training of deep neural networks (cs.NE) and the use of ensembles (cs.LG) in machine learning. The paper's focus on the behavior of neural networks and their training makes it likely to be categorized under cs.AI. Finally, the paper's use of lesion studies to analyze the behavior of neural networks suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
