This is a common problem in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of a multilayer perceptron, which is a powerful function approximator, indicating that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of global average pooling in the classification layer, which is a common technique in deep learning for reducing overfitting, suggesting that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
