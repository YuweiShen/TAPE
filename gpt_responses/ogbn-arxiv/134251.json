The use of monoidal categories and adjunctions also suggests a strong categorical and mathematical focus. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Programming Languages (cs.PL), Category Theory (cs.CT), Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL), and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
