The paper specifically focuses on feature selection for phishing detection, which involves using algorithms to identify the most relevant features for detecting phishing attacks. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, since phishing attacks often involve social engineering and human behavior, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cyberpsychology (cs.CY) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
