The use of the term \"covering radius\" suggests that the paper is related to sphere packing and covering problems, which are often studied in information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The mention of \"dual codes\" and \"antipodal\" suggests that the paper may also be related to algebraic coding theory (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.CC). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to cyber security (cs.CY) due to its focus on codes with high error-correcting capabilities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
