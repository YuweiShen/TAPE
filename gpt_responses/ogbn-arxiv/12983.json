The paper focuses on computer vision tasks, specifically semantic segmentation, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new viewpoint entropy formulation, which is a machine learning technique, falling under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses uncertainty computations on a superpixel level, which is a computer vision technique, falling under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of active learning, which is a machine learning technique, falling under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of selecting informative samples, which is a robotics and perception technique, falling under the robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
