This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Graphics (cs.GR), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Information Theory (cs.IT). However, given the focus on user experience and visual perception, cs.HC and cs.CV are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
