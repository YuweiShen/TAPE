The paper also discusses deep learning techniques and model complexity, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The authors also mention the use of pareto front to optimize performance, which is a concept commonly used in optimization and decision-making (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed method on low-end edge devices, which is related to information theory and signal processing (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
