The use of locational marginal prices (LMPs) to recover the grid Laplacian can be seen as a network inference problem, which falls under the purview of social and information networks. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to recover the grid Laplacian from LMPs. This involves the use of convex optimization and low rank- and sparsity-promoting regularizers, which are common techniques in machine learning. \n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper involves the use of numerical methods to solve the convex optimization problem formulated for grid topology identification. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the identification of the topology of a power grid, which is a complex system. The use of LMPs to recover the grid Laplacian can be seen as a control problem, which falls under the purview of systems and control. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a scalable algorithm to solve the convex optimization problem formulated for grid topology identification.
