It may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it discusses the structure of residual networks. Additionally, since the paper uses ResNet for image classification, it may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the benefits of skip connections, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Finally, since the paper deals with the optimization of deep neural networks, it may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
