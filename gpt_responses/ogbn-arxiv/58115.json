This suggests a focus on computer science and related fields. The paper also mentions the use of screening tools, which could fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) or computer engineering (cs.CE). The use of evidence-based methods could fall under cryptography and security (cs.CR) or natural language processing (cs.CL). Overall, the paper's focus on technology and healthcare suggests a primary category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
