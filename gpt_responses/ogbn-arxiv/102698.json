The focus on minimizing the number of measurements and decoding time suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the consideration of robustness and stability of the algorithm suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
