The paper also involves statistical tests to identify confounding effects, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with partial back-propagation, which is a neural network optimization technique, and hence, it can be associated with the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
