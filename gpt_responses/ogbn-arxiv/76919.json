The paper also uses graph-theoretic characterization results, which are common in computational geometry (cs.CG). The minimum cost homomorphism problem is a well-studied problem in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper focuses on locally semicomplete and quasi-transitive digraphs, which are two well-known generalizations of tournaments, a topic studied in graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
