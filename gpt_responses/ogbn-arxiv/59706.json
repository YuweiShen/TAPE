However, given that the paper proposes a new algorithm for building randomized classifiers that are robust to strong adversarial attacks, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the limitations of deterministic classifiers and the need for randomization, which could potentially place it under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the empirical results section suggests that the proposed defense method involves training neural networks, which could place it under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
