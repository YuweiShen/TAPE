It also mentions the energy needs of DNN accelerators, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves backpropagation, which is a common technique in neural networks and could relate to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses weight compression and accuracy loss, which could be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
