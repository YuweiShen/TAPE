The paper focuses on a universal, decentralized scenario where the guesser does not know the distribution of the random vector and is not allowed to use a strategy which prepares a list of words to be guessed in advance or even remember which words were already used. This scenario is useful in the context of brute-force attacks carried out by bots within a Botnet. The paper proposes universal decentralized guessing strategies for memoryless sources and finite-state sources, and derives the guessing exponent and a compatible converse bound. The strategies are based on randomized guessing using a universal distribution. The paper also extends the results to guessing with side information and designs efficient algorithms to sample from the universal distributions. Overall, the paper's focus on information theory, cryptography, and decentralized systems suggests that it is most likely to belong to the cs.IT, cs.CR, cs.DS, cs.LG, and cs.SY sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
