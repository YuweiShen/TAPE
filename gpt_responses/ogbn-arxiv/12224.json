This is a topic that falls under numerical analysis, specifically in the context of high-performance computing. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses techniques for reducing communication and data transfer in a distributed memory setting. This is a key topic in distributed and parallel computing. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification): The paper uses a rigorous task formalism to elaborate on the techniques used in the formulation. This could potentially fall under the category of symbolic computation and formal verification. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper presents a new formulation of ADER-DG that could be implemented in software for solving hyperbolic differential equation systems. This could fall under the category of mathematical software. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses techniques for breaking up the tight coupling of algorithmic steps in ADER-DG, which could be seen as a software engineering problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
