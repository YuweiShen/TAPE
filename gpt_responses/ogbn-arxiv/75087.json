Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, since the paper proposes a framework for backbone search using the detection task as guidance, it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also mentions the use of supernet and FLOPs complexity, which are related to Neural Networks (cs.NE) and Multimedia (cs.MM), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
