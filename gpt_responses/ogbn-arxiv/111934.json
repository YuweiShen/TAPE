The paper also presents an incremental learning approach, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of semantics and embeddings also relates to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the application of these techniques to service robots suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
