Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the proposed solutions involve enhancing the source context, learning morphology, and exploiting synonymous relations, which are all techniques related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also mentions using WordNet, which is a lexical database, indicating a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
