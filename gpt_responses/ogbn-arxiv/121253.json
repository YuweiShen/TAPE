Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of similarity metrics and the idea of dual-modality fashion, which are related to artificial intelligence (AI) and multimedia (MM) fields. Additionally, the paper uses a supervised learning approach, which is a common technique in neural networks and falls under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
