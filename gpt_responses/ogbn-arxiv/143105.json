The paper also introduces adaptive regularization techniques, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of autoregressive models and nonlocal self-similarity also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
