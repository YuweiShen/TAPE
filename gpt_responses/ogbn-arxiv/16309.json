However, the focus on propagation, blockage, and material penetration losses suggests that cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories, followed by cs.MM and cs.AR for the multimedia and augmented reality applications, and cs.SY for the system design and control aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
