This problem is related to signal processing on graphs, which is a subfield of machine learning and data analysis. The paper proposes a new approach based on graph spectral proxies, which are defined using the powers of the variation operator, in order to approximate the spectral content of graph signals. This approach is efficient and does not require the computation and storage of the basis elements. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
