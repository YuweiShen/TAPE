The focus on energy-efficient transmission suggests a potential fit with the sub-category of sustainable computing (cs.SI). The use of feedback in the channel also suggests a potential fit with the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the analysis of different transmission schemes and their performance suggests a potential fit with the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
