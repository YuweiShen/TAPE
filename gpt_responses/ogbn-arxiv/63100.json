This involves designing a specific input representation and using visual encoding to capture low-dimensional latent states. The paper also implements several state-of-the-art model-free deep RL algorithms with tricks to improve their performance. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, since visual encoding is used, cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also deals with decision making in complex scenarios, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
