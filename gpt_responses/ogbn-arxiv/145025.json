The use of multi-modal methods and fusion techniques also suggests relevance to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The proposed extreme light network architecture and streaming module may be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also deals with improving performance and reducing complexity, which could be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category.
