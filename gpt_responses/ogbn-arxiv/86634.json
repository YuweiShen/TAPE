The proposed framework uses reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and takes advantage of rich features (cs.CV) to recover from localization failure. The coordination between the robot and the human is also considered (cs.SY). The paper also presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which involves data analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
