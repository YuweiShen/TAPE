The use of external linguistic knowledge and regularization techniques are also common in NLP and AI research. Therefore, cs.CL and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves neural models, which are a common topic in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) research, making cs.LG and cs.NE likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper uses RC models to analyze text, which is a common application of computer vision (CV) techniques. Therefore, cs.CV is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
