Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel network decomposition strategy, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of binary weights and activations is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and the experiments involve image processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
