The use of deep learning frameworks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The application of the proposed method to automated driving and trajectory planning suggests that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of attention models in both spatial and temporal domains suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
