This falls under the domain of machine learning and hence, cs.LG is the most likely category.\n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper deals with the approximation of solutions of ODEs and discusses the complexity of the residual blocks required to obtain a prescribed accuracy. This is a topic of interest in numerical analysis and hence, cs.NA is a likely category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): ResNets have been widely used in computer vision tasks and the paper discusses their space-time expressivity. This could be of interest to researchers in the computer vision community and hence, cs.CV is a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of ResNets for approximating solutions of ODEs, which is a topic of interest in the systems and control community. Hence, cs.SY is a likely category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the use of deep learning architectures for approximating solutions of ODEs, which is a topic of interest in the AI community. Hence, cs.AI is a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
