The approach is based on minimizing the $\\ell_0$ norm of the vector of indicator variables, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method is demonstrated on synthetic and real-life applications, which suggests that it could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper provides an information-theoretic justification for incorporating Bernoulli distributions into the approach, which suggests that it could be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
