The paper also discusses rate-distortion and rate-dispersion functions, which are commonly studied in information theory and probability theory (cs.ITP). The paper also mentions the use of Gaussian complementary cdf, which is a common tool in signal processing and communication theory (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the fidelity of reproduction, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of symbol-by-symbol transmission, which is a topic in machine learning and statistical learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
