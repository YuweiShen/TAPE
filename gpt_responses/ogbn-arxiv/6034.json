This approach is based on semantic clustering, which suggests that scene images belong to hidden semantic topics that can be discovered by clustering semantic descriptors. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
