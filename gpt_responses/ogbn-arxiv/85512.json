The Certified Propagation Algorithm (CPA) is a protocol for solving this problem, which involves the exchange of messages between nodes in the network, making it relevant to the sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of local information and network topology, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR) and graph theory (cs.DS), respectively. Finally, the paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition for the correctness of CPA, which is a result in the field of control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
