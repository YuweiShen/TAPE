This is a problem that is typically studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking (cs.NI), and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a novel convex approximation technique, which is a common optimization method in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, and cs.SY, followed by cs.MM and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
