The use of block-circulant matrices for fine-grained tradeoff between accuracy and compression ratio suggests that the paper may belong to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of FPGA-based implementations suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Finally, the focus on energy efficiency and performance suggests that the paper may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
