This is a common area of research in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of hierarchies and ensembles also suggests a potential fit for natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the optimization of macroFscore and the use of random search optimization align with techniques commonly used in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
