Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning and computer vision techniques for eye contact detection, which suggests the relevance of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for accurate gaze estimation, which is a common topic in cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
