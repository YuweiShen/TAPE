This involves identifying and estimating the error in the discretized impulse response of the filter, which is used to calibrate the measurement matrix. Information theory concepts such as signal reconstruction and measurement matrix perturbations are also mentioned in the abstract. \n\n2. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The random demodulator is a compressive sensing architecture that provides efficient sub-Nyquist sampling of sparse band-limited signals. The paper proposes a calibration technique to improve signal reconstruction quality by addressing filter imperfections in the random demodulator. Signal processing techniques such as least-squares estimation and discrete Fourier transform trigonometric interpolation are also mentioned in the abstract. \n\n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the calibration of filter model mismatches in the random demodulator, which is a hardware device used for compressive sensing. The calibration technique involves identifying and estimating the error in the discretized impulse response of the filter, which is used to calibrate the measurement matrix. This can be seen as a control problem of correcting the filter imperfections to improve the performance of the random demodulator. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The random demodulator is a compressive sensing architecture that can be"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
