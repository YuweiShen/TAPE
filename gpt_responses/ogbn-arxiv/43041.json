The proposed approach involves training client-specific classifiers using deep convolutional neural networks, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The use of subject-specific score distributions and decision threshold tuning also involves statistical learning and optimization techniques, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
