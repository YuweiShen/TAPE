Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IOT (Internet of Things) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of application-based processors and the need for efficient and lightweight cryptographic ciphers, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.CY (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves testing and comparing the execution speeds of different encryption-decryption techniques, which could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
