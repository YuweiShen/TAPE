This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper formulates quadratic matrix learning as a standard semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the proposed framework on three different biometric recognition tasks, including face, palmprint, and ear recognition, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability issues of QML and proposes an efficient algorithm based on Lagrange duality theory, which suggests that it may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
