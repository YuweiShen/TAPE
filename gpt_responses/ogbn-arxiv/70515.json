The study also involves measurements and analysis of the capabilities and limitations of different mechanisms for passive suppression, which could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of environmental reflections and frequency selectivity on passive suppression, which could be relevant to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
