The proposed method involves regulating the interaction between different CAMs, which is a machine learning optimization problem (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a novel intra-sample strategy and an inter-sample criterion module, which involve developing new algorithms and techniques for machine learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve evaluating the proposed method on two widely-used datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
