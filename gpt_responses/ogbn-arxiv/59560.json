Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new strategy for assembling multiple backbones, which involves optimizing the network architecture, so it could also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques to improve object detection, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The proposed architecture involves iterative feeding of high-level features, which could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed architecture on the COCO dataset, which is a common benchmark for object detection, so it could also be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
