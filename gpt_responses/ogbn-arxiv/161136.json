This involves exploiting information retrieval techniques to infer test alarm causes based on test logs. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the use of information retrieval techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The development of a prototype and evaluation of the tool on industrial datasets suggests that the paper may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Finally, the focus on testing in clouds and automation of the procedure suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
