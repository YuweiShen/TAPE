This involves automatic alignment of fingerprint images to obtain the required training annotations, which is a common problem in computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of fully supervised learning, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM) applications, which are relevant to sub-categories cs.IR and cs.MM, respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the state-of-the-art recognition results and the ablation study, which are relevant to sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
