The approach is based on a network reparameterization that approximately diagonalizes the Fisher Information Matrix of the network parameters. This technique is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, given the focus on machine learning and neural networks, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
