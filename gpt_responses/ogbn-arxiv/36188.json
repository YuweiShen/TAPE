The paper presents a toolkit for emotion recognition from text, which is a common task in NLP. The toolkit is trained and tested on a gold standard dataset, which involves ML techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves training custom emotion classification models, which is a task related to ML and could fall under cs.LG (Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves analyzing online interactions, which could be related to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
