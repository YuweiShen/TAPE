The problem is formulated as a submodular maximization subject to a linear (knapsack) constraint. This formulation is a classic problem in computer science and falls under the category of discrete optimization (cs.DS). The paper proposes a new algorithmic framework for solving this problem, which involves augmenting partial Greedy solutions with the best additional item. This framework is applicable in various settings, including offline, multi-pass streaming, and distributed settings, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
