The paper also presents techniques for use with deduction systems (cs.PL), probabilistic logic (cs.PL), and probabilistic database models (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper's focus on anytime algorithms suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
