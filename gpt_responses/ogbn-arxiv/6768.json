The use of normalization techniques is also a common approach in deep learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the problem of saddle points, which is a topic in optimization and numerical analysis. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also applies the proposed method to various data-sets, which suggests that it may fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper introduces a dynamic normalization technique, which may be of interest to researchers in control theory and robotics, suggesting that it may also fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
