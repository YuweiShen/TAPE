Information theory is closely related to communication systems and signal processing, which are the main topics of this paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses networking techniques adapted to the lighting features of VLC systems. It introduces two multiple access techniques using EPPM that can be implemented using LEDs and support lighting features such as dimming. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses communication techniques for VLC systems using white LEDs as sources. It introduces two multiple access techniques using EPPM that can be implemented using LEDs and support lighting features such as dimming. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it discusses the use of multilevel symbols to provide M-ary signaling for multiple users using multilevel EPPM (MEPPM). Machine learning techniques are often used for signal processing and classification tasks, which are related to the topic of this paper. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses techniques for controlling the optical peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in VLC systems, which is related to system control. It also discusses the use of sub"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
