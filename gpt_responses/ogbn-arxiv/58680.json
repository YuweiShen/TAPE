This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The technique is applied to outlier detection, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the effect of kernel function parameters, which is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
