The paper also discusses the limitations of existing defenses and proposes a new probabilistic framework, which could potentially fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses a detection method based on metric learning, which could fall under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
