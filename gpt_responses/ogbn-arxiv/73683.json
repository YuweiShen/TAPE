Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a deep learning approach that combines coarse and fine regression output for head pose estimation. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper's application in gaze estimation and face alignment suggests that it may also belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
