It also mentions the use of computational equipment and software frameworks, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The concept of self-evolving properties and evolutionary development implies the use of machine learning and evolutionary algorithms, which are also covered under the categories of machine learning (cs.MA) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
