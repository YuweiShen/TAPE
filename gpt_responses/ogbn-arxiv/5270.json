This involves the use of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and tracking solutions to discover more diverse instances from online videos. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques such as exemplar learning and fine-tuning, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of tracking solutions also suggests that the paper may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of massive online unlabeled videos, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
