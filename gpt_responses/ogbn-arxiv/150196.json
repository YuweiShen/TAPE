The paper presents an algorithm that computes the fastest known Boolean circuit for an \\aop~ with given arrival times for the input signals. This problem is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including algorithms and complexity (cs.AR), data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational complexity (cs.CC), and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
