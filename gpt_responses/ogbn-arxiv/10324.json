This involves learning user representations that are dynamically updated based on the context of the recommendations. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
