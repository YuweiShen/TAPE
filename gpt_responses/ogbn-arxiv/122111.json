The approach involves using digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) that are scalable and can be realized with non-linear dynamical systems with memory. The paper discusses the self-organizing logic gates used in DMMs, which are \"terminal-agnostic\" and do not distinguish between input and output terminals. The paper also discusses the collective dynamical behavior of DMMs, which is reminiscent of a phase transition or the \"edge of chaos.\" Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
