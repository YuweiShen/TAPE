The paper utilizes hashtags and hyper-links in tweets to cluster documents into different topic sets and to highlight certain key points of the corresponding document. The paper also develops an Integer Linear Programming solution to discover the sentence set reaching the upper bound of ROUGE. The paper then verifies the informativeness and readability of the collected summaries by manual judgment and trains a Support Vector Regression summarizer on DUC generic multi-document summarization benchmarks. Therefore, this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This paper deals with natural language processing and summarization, which are relevant topics in this sub-category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This paper proposes a method for collecting summaries with reference to social media's reactions, which is related to information retrieval.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This paper utilizes social media's reactions to collect summaries, which is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category deals with speech and audio processing, which are not directly related to this paper.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper trains a Support Vector Regression summarizer, which is a machine learning method, on DUC generic multi-document summarization benchmarks.
