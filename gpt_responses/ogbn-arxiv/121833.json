It also formulates the question of whether additional information can be harmful in the form of Informational Braes' Paradox (IBP). These topics are closely related to game theory and its applications in traffic congestion. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with traffic congestion in networks and the effect of additional information on it. It also discusses GPS-based route guidance systems, which are related to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper studies the impact of information on traffic congestion, which is a social and information network problem. It also discusses the properties of networks in terms of their series of linearly independent (SLI) class, which is related to social and information networks. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper formulates the question of whether additional information can be harmful in the form of Informational Braes' Paradox (IBP) and provides a comprehensive answer to it. This topic is related to computational engineering, finance, and science. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the effect of information on traffic"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
