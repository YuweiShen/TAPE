The use of jamming and relays also falls under the category of network security (cs.CR). The paper also mentions interference cancellation, which is a technique used in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed algorithm involves selecting relay nodes and setting thresholds, which can be considered as a control system (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
