The paper uses techniques from computational geometry, such as witness-collector method and layered construction, and the result is of interest to researchers in computational geometry, discrete mathematics, and numerical analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.GR (Graphics), and cs.MS (Mathematical Software)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
