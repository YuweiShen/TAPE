The paper also discusses the effect of propagation environment on capacity bounds, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also focuses on communication and transmission signals, which are related to communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of multiple antennas, which is related to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
