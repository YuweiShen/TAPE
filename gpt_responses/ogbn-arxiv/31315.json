The use of prior-independent mechanisms and the comparison to an offline benchmark suggest a focus on learning theory (cs.LG) and online algorithms (cs.DS). The connection to multi-armed bandits (MAB) is also mentioned, which is a well-studied problem in machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
