The paper also proposes a two-stage auction process for requesting storage capacity and access with latency requirements, which involves game theory and optimization techniques, making it relevant to Game Theory and Information Theory (cs.GT, cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of different storage tiers and access request scheduling policies, which are related to Networked and Internet-based Systems (cs.NI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
