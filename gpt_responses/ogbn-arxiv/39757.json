It also involves visual inputs and image processing techniques such as rotation, translation, and cropping (cs.CV). The paper explores how to improve the generalization of the agent, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the agent's performance is based on a set of human-designed levels, which could fall under the category of graphics and games (cs.GR). Finally, the paper also involves robotics, as the techniques explored could potentially be applied to robotic vision and control (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
