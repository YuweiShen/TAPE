The use of deep reinforcement learning for configuring shunt capacitors suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on voltage regulation in distribution grids also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
