This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence in games. \n2. cs.GR: The paper explores the use of the CEM framework to generate adaptive adversarial behaviour in NPCs in a dungeon-crawler game. This involves the use of graphics and rendering techniques to create the game environment and characters. \n3. cs.LG: The paper discusses the use of a coupled empowerment maximisation (CEM) policy to generate generic, companion-like behaviour in NPCs, and extends it with a minimisation policy to give rise to adversarial behaviour. This involves the use of machine learning techniques to train the NPC behaviour. \n4. cs.SD: The paper discusses the challenges of creating believable NPCs that can react robustly to unforeseen player behaviour or novel game content, and proposes a solution using the CEM framework. This involves the use of software engineering techniques to design and implement the NPC behaviour. \n5. cs.HC: The paper discusses the use of NPCs in games and the challenges of creating believable characters, which is relevant to the domain of human-computer interaction. Additionally, the study conducted in the paper involves human participants playing the game and interacting with the NPCs, which falls under the domain of user"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
