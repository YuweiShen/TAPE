The algorithmic results rely on probabilistic techniques and the connection between anonymous games and Poisson multinomial distributions, which suggests a possible fit with sub-categories such as cs.DS (probabilistic analysis and algorithms) and cs.IT (information theory). The paper also discusses the use of simple strategies in anonymous games, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (artificial intelligence) and cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
