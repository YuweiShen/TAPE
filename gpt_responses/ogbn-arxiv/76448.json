Computer vision techniques are used to extract information from these streams and reconstruct the 3D structure of anatomical landmarks on individuals in the space. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses hardware and software innovations for capturing and processing a large number of video streams, which involves graphics processing and rendering. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with capturing and processing multiple video streams to reconstruct 3D motion of people engaged in social interactions, which falls under the domain of multimedia. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the challenges of capturing social interactions and the impact of the number of views on achieving the goal. This involves understanding human behavior and interaction, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses a system for capturing and reconstructing 3D motion of people engaged in social interactions, which can have applications in robotics for understanding human behavior and interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
