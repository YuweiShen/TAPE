The paper also discusses counting CSP problems, which are related to constraint satisfaction problems, indicating that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The use of matchgate computation and holographic algorithms suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories.
