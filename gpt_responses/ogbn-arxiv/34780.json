This indicates that the paper is related to computer vision and falls under this category. \n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper deals with mapping applications to a heterogeneous embedded multiprocessor, which is related to hardware architecture. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the impact of the proposed heuristics on the schedule of a real imaging application, which is related to systems and control. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper does not directly deal with programming languages, but the proposed heuristics can be implemented using programming languages, and the paper mentions the implementation details of the heuristics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
