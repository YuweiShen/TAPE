Specifically, the focus on h-index and g-index makes it likely to belong to cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which are concerned with information retrieval and analysis. Additionally, the study's use of descriptive statistics and subject fields suggests it could also belong to cs.CY (Computational Geometry), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), which all involve analyzing and comparing data in various contexts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
