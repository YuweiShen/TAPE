The paper specifically focuses on the problem of catastrophic forgetting, which is a common issue in deep learning, and proposes a new method for approximating loss functions that is motivated by empirical observations of how updates to network parameters affect target loss functions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
