The paper specifically focuses on vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and their training techniques, which are related to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
