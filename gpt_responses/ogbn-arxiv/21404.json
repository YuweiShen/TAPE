This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically deals with computer vision (cs.CV) datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and ImageNet. The paper also discusses the use of Rademacher complexity, which is a measure of the complexity of a function class, indicating a possible fit for artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing (cs.CL) in the sense that it discusses the labeling of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
