This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of feedback to improve the performance of the codes, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). The simulations and experiments conducted in the paper involve signal processing (cs.MM) and communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
