Databases often deal with large-scale data and optimization of queries, which makes this category a likely fit.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper specifically mentions machine learning tasks and how the proposed optimization technique can improve their performance. This category is a very likely fit.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses techniques for optimizing linear algebra expressions, which can be seen as a type of algorithm. This category is also a likely fit.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses integrating the optimizer into SystemML, a software system for machine learning. This makes this category a possible fit.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the conversion of linear algebra expressions into relational algebra expressions, which can be seen as a type of programming language. This category is a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
