This involves analyzing the decoding complexity by mapping the massive MIMO system to a lattice. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses the potential use of this scheme for secure communication without a pre-shared secret, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
