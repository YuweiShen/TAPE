The IC is a type of wireless network, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also utilizes statistical methods to approximate the effect of CSI imperfection, which is related to statistical inference (cs.SI). The use of MIMO technology in the IC is a topic in multiple antenna systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper employs Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithms, which is a common method in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
