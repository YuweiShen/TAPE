The use of non-convex and gradient-based methods suggests that the paper may fall under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The mention of theoretical results and approximation guarantees suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of algorithms that are easy to implement suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
