The paper also mentions the use of summarization systems, which is a common technique in NLP. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of scientific research and the scientific method, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of services to solve copyright issues, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper mentions experimentation with summarization systems, which suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
