The use of Fountain codes in designing queries and parity measurements suggests that this paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of distributed storage (cs.DS). The analysis of trade-offs between query difficulty and sample complexity involves concepts from machine learning and statistics, making the paper relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) due to the use of parity measurements. Finally, the problem of data acquisition and information recovery is a general problem in computer science, making the paper potentially relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
