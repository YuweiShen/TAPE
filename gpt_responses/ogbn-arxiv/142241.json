The use of deep neural networks and architectural design contributions suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The focus on training a cascade of patch-based upsampling networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
