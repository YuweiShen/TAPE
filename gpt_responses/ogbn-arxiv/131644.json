This involves analyzing the information capacity of the system, which falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The use of LIS on building walls to provide supplementary links for wireless communication systems is a networking and internet architecture problem. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an optimal phase shift design based on statistical channel state information, which involves designing a control system to optimize the performance of the wireless communication system. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the effect of phase shifts on the ergodic capacity in different propagation scenarios, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): This category is less likely, but the paper may have implications for society in terms of improving wireless communication systems and enabling better connectivity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
