The use of large datasets and training models also suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges and potential solutions in the area of forensic science, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of feature extraction and classification techniques also suggests the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of sketches and photo images, which suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
