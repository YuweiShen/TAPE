This involves using taxonomies to identify superclass/subclass relationships between concepts and quantifying the amount by which a conceptual design improves query effectiveness. This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
