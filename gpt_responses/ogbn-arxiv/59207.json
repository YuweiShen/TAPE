The specific application of this optimization is for deep neural networks used in computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of adaptive sampling to improve the efficiency of the optimization process, which could also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
