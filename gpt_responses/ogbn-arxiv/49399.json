This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a prediction framework and Gaussian approximations suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the branch and bound optimisation method falls under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
