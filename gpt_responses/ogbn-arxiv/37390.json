It proposes practical and efficient channel training methods for achieving optimal EB in a distributed WET system. The paper focuses on the design of waveforms from multiple energy transmitters (ETs) over wireless channels, which requires accurate channel state information (CSI) at the ETs. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of communication systems and their limits, including channel coding, modulation, and channel capacity. The paper proposes channel training methods for optimizing the wireless channels, which is related to the information theory of wireless communication systems.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer networks and their protocols. The paper proposes a distributed WET system with multiple energy transmitters, which is related to the networking and architecture of wireless power transfer systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the analysis, design, and control of complex systems, including feedback control, optimization, and estimation. The paper proposes energy feedback methods for optimizing the wireless channels, which is related to the control and optimization of wireless power transfer systems.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the processing"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
