The paper also studies the impact of limited lookahead on the stability and inefficiency of outcomes, which is a key concern in game theory. \n2. cs.NE (Network Economics): The paper deals with network congestion games, which are a key area of research in network economics. The paper also studies the impact of limited lookahead on the stability and inefficiency of outcomes, which is a key concern in network economics. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a novel framework to model limited lookahead in congestion games, which involves designing algorithms to simulate the behavior of players in the game. The paper also studies the impact of limited lookahead on the stability and inefficiency of outcomes, which involves analyzing the performance of these algorithms. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper introduces a novel framework to model limited lookahead in congestion games, which involves designing algorithms to simulate the behavior of players in the game.
