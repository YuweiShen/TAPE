This falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses pre-coding and decoding techniques, which are commonly used in network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of approximations and trade-offs, which are common in machine learning (cs.MM) and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
