The use of low-rank approximation and residual modules also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of GPUs and embedded systems suggests a potential focus on neural engineering (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
