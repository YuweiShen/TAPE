This work is relevant to the networking and security community, and falls under the category of computer networks and communications (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses policy conflict management, which is relevant to the security community and falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of high-level abstractions and programming languages, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the framework using testbed measurements and simulations, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
