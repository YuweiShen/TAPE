Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves learning algorithms and models, which suggests cs.LG (Learning) as the second likely sub-category. The use of external knowledge bases and distant supervision indicates cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another possible sub-category. The paper also involves neural networks and deep learning, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with data mining and knowledge discovery, which suggests cs.DB (Databases) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
