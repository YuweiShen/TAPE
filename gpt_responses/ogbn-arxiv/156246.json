Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of distributional measures, which is a topic related to machine learning and data mining, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of knowledge sources such as WordNet, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the applicability of these measures in resource-poor languages, which is a topic related to information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses recent work on hybrid measures, which is a topic related to computer science and computational complexity, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
