This involves analyzing temporal sequencing of objects in the trailers, which is a key aspect of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses using historical customer data to improve predictions, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new model for recommendation systems, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
