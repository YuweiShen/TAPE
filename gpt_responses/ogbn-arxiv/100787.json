Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper mentions sublinear separators, which are also relevant to cs.GT (Graph Theory) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
