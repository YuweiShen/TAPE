This involves the use of IoT devices and fog computing to efficiently manage the data of heart patients. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of ensemble deep learning for automatic diagnosis of heart diseases. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the management of data of heart patients using IoT devices and fog computing. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a smart healthcare system for automatic diagnosis of heart diseases. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper involves the use of fog computing to bring resources closer to the user and provide low latency and energy efficient solutions for data processing. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a fog-enabled cloud framework, FogBus, for deploying and testing the performance of the proposed model in terms of power consumption, network bandwidth, latency, jitter, accuracy and execution time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
