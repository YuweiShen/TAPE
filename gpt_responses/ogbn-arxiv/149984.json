The use of fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for CRFs training may suggest that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
