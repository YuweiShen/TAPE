This involves learning shape descriptors using a mixture of power function-based spectral transform. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed network architecture involves metric learning, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves experiments on challenging benchmarks, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
