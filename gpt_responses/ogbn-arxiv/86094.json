The paper proposes a new algorithm for provable model recovery for ICA with Gaussian noise. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses fixed point iteration and optimization techniques, which are common in the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). The paper also deals with signal processing and optimization objectives, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Systems and Control (cs.SD). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.IT, cs.NA, cs.SI, and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
