The paper also derives a closed-form lower bound to quantify the achievable SE of the proposed system. These contributions are related to information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a hybrid analog and digital precoding scheme for SE maximization in mmWave MIMO systems. This is related to communication networks and architectures. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mmWave MIMO systems for improving the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) in wireless communication. This is related to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a two-step algorithm to optimize the hybrid precoder for the proposed GenSM aided mmWave MIMO system. This is related to control systems and optimization. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel mmWave MIMO system that can convey an extra data stream without requiring an extra RF chain. This is related to networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
