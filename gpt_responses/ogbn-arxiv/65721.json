The paper proposes a new algorithmic technique for fast reaction times to guarantee safety, which is a key concern in robotics. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also proposes a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation and a line search algorithm, which are common techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Optimization (cs.SY). The paper also extensively tests the proposed algorithm in simulation and real hardware, which is a common practice in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
