This involves studying the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and deriving a novel precoding scheme, which falls under the purview of Information Theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a Network MIMO channel with 2 Transmitters (TXs) jointly serving 2 users, which falls under the domain of Networking and Internet Architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with a decentralized setting where each TX has a different multi-user Channel State Information (CSI), which can be seen as a social network where each node has different information. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with achieving a high sum rate in a MIMO channel, which falls under the domain of Multimedia. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper involves deriving a novel precoding scheme, which can be seen as a computational engineering problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
