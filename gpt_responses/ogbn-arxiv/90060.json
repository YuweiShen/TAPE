This involves analyzing a large amount of user-generated content, which is a common task in information retrieval. \n\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze micro blog data. This is a common area of research in the cs.CL sub-category. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with analyzing user-generated content on micro blogs, which is a type of social network. The proposed approach could be used to analyze other types of social networks as well. \n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper deals with the use of user-generated content for need elicitation, which has implications for the design of products and services. This falls under the broader category of computers and society. \n\n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a machine learning approach for need elicitation, which involves developing software to analyze micro blog data.
