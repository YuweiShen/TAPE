The paper also introduces a new Bayesian Word Embeddings model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of latent variable models to anchor the dimensions of the embeddings is related to the field of social informatics (cs.SI), which studies the social aspects of information and communication technologies. Finally, the paper applies the model to two cases related to international relations and foreign policy, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY), which includes the study of communication and control in complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
