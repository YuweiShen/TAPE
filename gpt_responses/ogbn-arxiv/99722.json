Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel backtracking scheme and a sample-balanced objective, which are related to machine learning and optimization, respectively. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper uses local features for outdoor RGB-only applications, which is related to graphics and visualization, making cs.GR (Computer Graphics) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
