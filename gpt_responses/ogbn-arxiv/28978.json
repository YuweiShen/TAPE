This falls under the scope of mathematical software development, making cs.MS the most likely category.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper focuses on the development and optimization of numerical methods for solving PDEs, including GPU-based sparse approximate inverses, matrix-free sum-factorization, and partially matrix-free preconditioners. This falls under the scope of numerical analysis, making cs.NA a likely category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the development of scalable PDE solvers for future exascale systems with a heterogeneous massively parallel architecture. This falls under the scope of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing, making cs.DC a likely category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the implementation and optimization of software for solving PDEs on future exascale systems. This falls under the scope of software engineering, making cs.SE a possible category.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of PDE solvers in a land-surface model including subsurface flow and surface runoff.
