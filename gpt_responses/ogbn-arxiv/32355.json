These are common problems in computer vision, which are typically addressed in the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes an augmented CNN as a solution, which falls under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
