This involves using neural networks and contextual information to encode nuanced semantic relationships into geometric ones. The paper is focused on the science of science and the structure of knowledge domains, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of embeddings for information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL), which further supports these sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of embeddings for classification tasks (cs.LG) and the analysis of complex networks (cs.SI), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
