This is a core topic in machine learning, and the paper presents extensive simulations to compare DDSE with several carefully-designed baselines, verifying its consistently superior performance. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the application of DDSE to the novel domain of brain encoding, which involves analyzing and interpreting brain activity data to understand how the brain processes information. This is a subfield of computer vision and pattern recognition, and the paper's focus on feature sparsity and model compactness is relevant to many computer vision applications. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a new neural network architecture, DDSE, which is designed to sparsify both the output features and the learned model parameters. This is a core topic in neural network research, and the paper's focus on sparsity and compactness is relevant to many areas of neural and evolutionary computing. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new deep learning model, DDSE, which is designed to jointly exploit the problem structure and the parameter structure in the context of deep modeling.
