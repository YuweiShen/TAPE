The paper discusses query expansion techniques for information retrieval systems, which falls under the sub-field of Information Retrieval (IR) in computer science. Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses natural language processing techniques such as synonymy and semantic similarity, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CL (Computational Linguistics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of automatic query categorisation methods, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
