It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as object pose estimation is a crucial task in robotics. The use of deep generative models and deep neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the integration of learning of canonical shape space and pose and size estimation may suggest that it belongs to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
