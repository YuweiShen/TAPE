Specifically, it proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based solution for modeling physically plausible spatially varying surface reflectance functions (SVBRDF) from a single photograph of a planar material sample under unknown natural illumination. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves graphics and rendering techniques, as it involves rendering the exact corresponding image under a new lighting condition. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.GR (Computer Graphics). \n\nThe paper proposes a self-augmented training process to reduce the amount of required labeled training data. This involves estimating provisional model parameters for each unlabeled training exemplar and synthesizing a novel temporary labeled training pair by rendering the exact corresponding image under a new lighting condition. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper involves deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for modeling surface appearance. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper involves image processing and analysis techniques, specifically for modeling surface appearance from a single photograph. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
