The paper specifically addresses the problem of learning networks of hard-threshold functions in a principled way, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of \"Learning\" (cs.LG). The paper also presents empirical results on classification accuracy for image datasets, which suggests that it may also fall under the sub-categories of \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of avoiding vanishing and exploding gradients, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents a recursive mini-batch algorithm for learning deep hard-threshold networks, which involves optimization techniques, and thus may also fall under the sub-category of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
