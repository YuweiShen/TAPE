This involves the exchange of intrinsic information between the detector and the decoder, which is a key concept in information theory. \n\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): SCMA is a multiplexing approach used in wireless communication systems to achieve high system capacity. The paper proposes a new detection and decoding scheme for SCMA systems, which is relevant to the communications and networking community. \n\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme involves the exchange of information between the detector and the decoder, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new iterative detection and decoding scheme for SCMA systems, which can be seen as a control system for improving the performance of wireless communication systems. \n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): SCMA is a multiplexing approach that can be used to transmit multimedia data over wireless communication systems. The proposed scheme can improve the performance of SCMA systems, making it relevant to the multimedia community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
