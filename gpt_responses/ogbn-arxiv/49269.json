The consideration of noise correlation also suggests a possible fit in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of different relay schemes (DF, CF, AF) and power allocation strategies may also relate to the Communications (cs.COMM) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
