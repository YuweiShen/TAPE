The use of Bayesian deep learning methods to provide principled confidence and quantify predictive uncertainty is a key aspect of the work. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with multimodal data, which suggests a possible fit with cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
