The proposed approach involves the use of direction-aware, learnable, additive kernels and an adversarial network to improve the accuracy of the recognition and reduce noise in the semantic segmentation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, since the paper deals with geometric representations of floor plans, it could also be categorized under graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
