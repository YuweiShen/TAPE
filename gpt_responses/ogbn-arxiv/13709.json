The use of semi-supervised learning framework and specially designed data augmentation strategies also suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques. The mention of achieving state-of-the-art results in the field of image recognition indicates the use of advanced multimedia techniques (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
