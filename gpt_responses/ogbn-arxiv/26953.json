This involves incorporating relational reasoning in finding new unlabeled pairs and devising new query strategies. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Databases (cs.DB), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
