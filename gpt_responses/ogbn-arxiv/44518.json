The paper proposes a new loss function and a general weighting framework for understanding existing pair-based loss functions, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its proposed method on multiple image retrieval benchmarks, which involves multimedia analysis and retrieval (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a more principled approach for collecting and weighting informative pairs, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
