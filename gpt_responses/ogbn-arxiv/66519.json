This methodology is applied to the hard science disciplines of the Italian university research system. The paper does not focus on a specific area of computer science, but rather proposes a methodology that could be applied across disciplines. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
