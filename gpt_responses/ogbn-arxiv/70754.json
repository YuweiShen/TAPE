The use of binary and ternary weights is a technique for reducing memory size and increasing processing speed, which is relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for training neural networks, which falls under the deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
