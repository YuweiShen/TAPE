The use case of forward-looking sonar images also suggests a robotics application (cs.RO). The paper uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a popular tool in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention the use of thresholding and filtering techniques, which are common in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with generalization to previously unseen objects, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
