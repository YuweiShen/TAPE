This involves optimizing reserve prices over time in a GSP-like auction. Game theory concepts are also mentioned in the abstract. \n2. cs.LG (Computer Science - Learning): The paper applies reinforcement learning techniques to learn the set of optimal reserve prices over repeated interactions. A buyer behavior model is also trained using real bidding data. \n3. cs.IR (Computer Science - Information Retrieval): The paper deals with sponsored search auctions, which are a type of online advertising. The optimization of reserve prices is aimed at maximizing revenue for the search engine. \n4. cs.AI (Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a reinforcement/MDP based algorithm to optimize reserve prices over time. This involves learning from data and making decisions based on the current state of the auction. \n5. cs.DS (Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This involves implementing the algorithm within the current sponsored search framework of a major search engine."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
