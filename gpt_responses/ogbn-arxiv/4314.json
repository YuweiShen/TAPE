These are both concepts that fall under information theory. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless video transmission and uses peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as a quality metric. These are both concepts that fall under multimedia. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with resource allocation for wireless transmissions, which is a networking concept. \n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with wireless video transmission and uses PSNR as a quality metric, which are both concepts that fall under signal processing. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While the paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision or pattern recognition, it does deal with video transmission and quality metrics, which are both concepts that can be relevant to computer vision and pattern recognition applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
