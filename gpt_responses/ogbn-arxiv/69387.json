The use of avoiding words suggests a connection to formal languages (cs.FL). The Frankl theorem mentioned in the paper is a result in combinatorics (cs.LO). The concept of synchronizing automata is related to control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the Cerny conjecture is a well-known open problem in theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
