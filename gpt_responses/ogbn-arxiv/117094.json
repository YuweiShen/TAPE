The paper proposes a new measure of visual complexity for line charts, which is relevant to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the use of statistical measures commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) to quantify the complexity of visualizations. Additionally, the paper presents a study involving human participants, which is relevant to the field of graphics (cs.GR) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
