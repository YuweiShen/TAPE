The proposed attacks involve manipulating the video in a way that the algorithm returns the adversary's desired outputs, which is a form of adversarial attacks (cs.CR). The paper also proposes introducing randomness to video analysis algorithms as a countermeasure, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
