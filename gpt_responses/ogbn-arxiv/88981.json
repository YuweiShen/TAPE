The paper proposes a novel approach that uses local context to track targets, which involves learning spatial relations and graph optimization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on wide area aerial imagery sequences, which is a task commonly addressed in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
