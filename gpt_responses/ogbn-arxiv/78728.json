The paper also proposes a new memory model that is constructed with the goal of preserving uniprocessor optimizations. \n\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the behavior of weak memory models from a programmer's perspective and disallows some optimizations that break a programmer's intuition. The paper also provides operational and axiomatic semantics for the proposed General Atomic Memory Model (GAM). \n\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper provides insights into the inherent nature of weak memory models and proposes a new model that allows all four load/store reorderings. The paper also discusses the formalization of weak memory models over the last decades. \n\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the construction of a shared memory multiprocessor and the desire to preserve uniprocessor optimizations while building it. The paper also compares the performance of the proposed GAM model with other models through simulation. \n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the behavior of weak memory models and proposes a new model that disallows some optimizations that break a programmer's intuition.
