The use of path-following algorithms and polynomial time solutions suggest a focus on computational complexity, which could place the paper in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The mention of finding equilibria using AI techniques could also suggest a connection to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.
