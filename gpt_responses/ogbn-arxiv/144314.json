The paper also mentions the need for user feedback, which relates to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper provides a descriptive information fiche for the most relevant tools, which could be considered as a form of machine learning (cs.MA) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
