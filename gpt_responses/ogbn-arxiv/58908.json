This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically, the sub-categories of computational epidemiology (cs.CE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as the paper deals with predicting a medical condition using machine learning. The paper also deals with data management and processing, which falls under the sub-category of databases (cs.DB).
