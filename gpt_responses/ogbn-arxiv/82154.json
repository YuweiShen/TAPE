The paper also explores the theoretical properties of dropout, which is related to optimization (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper focuses on linear classification, which is a common task in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
