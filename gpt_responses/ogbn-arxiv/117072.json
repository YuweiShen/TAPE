It discusses the challenges of operating on encrypted traffic without compromising security or degrading performance, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a solution that involves using Intel SGX, which is a technology related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The solution also involves ensuring interoperability with existing protocols, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
