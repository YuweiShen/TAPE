This involves the use of normalized mutual information as a robust information-theoretic similarity measure for DWI. The paper also extends the LOR-DWI density-based hierarchical scale-space model to non-rigid deformations and shows that the formulation provides intrinsic regularization through the orientational information. Given these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Information Theory (cs.IT), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves numerical analysis and optimization techniques, which could place it in the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Machine Learning (cs.MS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
