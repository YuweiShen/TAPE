The use of supervised classifiers such as kNN and SVM suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The use of Fourier transform and frequency domain features suggests that the paper may also belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SD) categories. Additionally, the use of robust features and noise resistance suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
