This is a clear indication of software engineering concerns, such as version control, security, and integration. \n- cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions security as one of the issues with using spreadsheets, and implies that a web-based solution would be more secure. This suggests that the authors are concerned with cryptography and security aspects of the problem. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Similar to cs.CY, the paper touches on security concerns related to intellectual property and correct usage of spreadsheets. This could also be interpreted as a cryptography and security issue. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper compares different approaches to transforming spreadsheets into web applications, including Excel Services, custom-built software, and EASA. This suggests that the authors are interested in programming language aspects of the problem, such as the trade-offs between different technologies. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions integration with other systems as a requirement for the solution, which implies that there is a need for database-related functionality. This could include data storage, retrieval, and manipulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
