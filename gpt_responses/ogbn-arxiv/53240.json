Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the processing, transmission, and storage of information. The paper also involves techniques for spatial signal processing, which falls under the category of cs.SI (Signal Processing). The use of MIMO systems suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which deals with the design and analysis of communication networks. The paper also involves techniques for handling large-scale data, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves techniques for estimating signal parameters, which falls under the category of cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
