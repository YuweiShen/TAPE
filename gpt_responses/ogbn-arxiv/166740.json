The paper uses techniques from graph theory, combinatorics, and computational complexity, which are typically studied in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory).
