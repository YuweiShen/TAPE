This involves the use of various data structures and algorithms to process and analyze the data, making cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the use of statistical techniques to analyze biological datasets, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms. This makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. q-bio.QM (Quantitative Methods) - The paper discusses the use of statistical techniques to analyze biological datasets, which falls under the scope of q-bio.QM.\n4. q-bio.TO (Tissues and Organs) - The paper discusses the analysis of single cell Hi-C contact maps, which is related to the study of tissues and organs, making q-bio.TO a likely sub-category.\n5. stat.ML (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the use of statistical techniques to analyze biological datasets, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms.
