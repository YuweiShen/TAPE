Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely sub-category. The algorithm also involves combinatorial optimization and graph algorithms, which are relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also mentions empirical comparisons and performance analysis, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
