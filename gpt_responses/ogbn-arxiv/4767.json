The paper also presents countermeasures for mitigating the effects of jamming attacks, which can be categorized under the sub-domain of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper considers the multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.MM).
