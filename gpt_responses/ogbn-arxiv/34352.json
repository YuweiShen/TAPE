The paper also emphasizes the optimization of log data for use in machine learning, which suggests a connection to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper discusses challenges and solutions related to data storage and processing, which could be relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) and database (cs.DB) categories.
