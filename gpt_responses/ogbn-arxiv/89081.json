Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and secure throughput are used to analyze the system's performance. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on the security of the legitimate system in the presence of an attacker who can operate as a jammer or an eavesdropper. The attacker's power splitting parameter and jamming/eavesdropping probability are designed to minimize the secure throughput of the legitimate system. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper investigates the impact of channel randomness and data arrival behavior on the system's security. The buffer-aided transmitter communicates with a receiving node, and the legitimate link's channel randomness is considered. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper designs a jamming scheme for the attacker and investigates its impact on the secure throughput of the legitimate system. The attacker's power splitting parameter and jamming/eavesdropping probability are optimized based on the energy state of the attacker's battery. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but the buffer-aided transmitter can be seen as a multimedia source that sends data to the receiving node.
