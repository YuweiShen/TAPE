The study participants were a sample of freshmen entering university, and their opinions on political and social issues and lists of activities on campus were regularly recorded. The paper identifies a behavioral network defined by call and text data and a cognitive network based on friendship nominations in ego-network surveys. Both networks are limited to study participants, and a wide range of attributes on each node were collected in self-reports, making these networks attribute-rich. The paper studies whether student preferences for certain attributes of friends can predict formation and dissolution of edges in both networks. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks), cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
