Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses interpolation problems, which are relevant to programming languages and software engineering, suggesting cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) as likely categories. Additionally, the paper mentions well-founded interpolation, which is relevant to formal methods and verification, suggesting cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) as a possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for a common back-end interpolation interface, which could be relevant to scientific computing, suggesting cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
