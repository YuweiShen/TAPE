The paper discusses the issue of label quality in weakly supervised learning and proposes a solution that uses a small amount of validation data to guide the optimization of label quality. The paper also discusses the use of Bi-Level optimization to formalize this approach. Given the focus on machine learning and computer vision, as well as the use of optimization techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
