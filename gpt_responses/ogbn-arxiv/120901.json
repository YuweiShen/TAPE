The proposed pipeline also involves the use of multiple sensors and relatively little training data, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the challenges of processing large swaths of imagery and the need for efficient algorithms, which could be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the pipeline involves the use of robotics and automation for satellite imagery analytics, which could be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
