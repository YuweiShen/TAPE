This involves the use of deep convolutional denoising autoencoders (CDAE) for generating an invariant, compact representation of these images. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also deals with classification of gene ontology categories, which involves machine learning techniques. This makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. \n\nThe paper also deals with neural images, which is a topic related to neuroscience.
