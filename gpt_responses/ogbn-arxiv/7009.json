The use of random linear feedbacks and the introduction of new concepts and technical tools suggest a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) perspective. The focus on finite time stabilization and the use of probabilistic guarantees suggest a neural networks (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.RO) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
