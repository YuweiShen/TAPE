The paper also provides robotic simulation and experimental results. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper uses control barrier functions (CBFs) to guarantee reachability and safety for a system. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper introduces a scheme to prioritize different barrier functions which allows the user to encode the notion of priority based control. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper encodes complex task specifications using linear temporal logic (LTL), which is a common tool in AI for reasoning about temporal properties. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a method of composition of multiple barrier functions in order to mitigate infeasibility, which is a software engineering problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
