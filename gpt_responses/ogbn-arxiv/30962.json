This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed model is trained using large-scale simulated self-supervision with procedurally generated tool objects, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the model is tested on real-world experiments, which involves system and control (cs.SY) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
