It also involves empirical evaluation of the proposed approach. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as adversarial attacks and defenses are particularly relevant in the context of image classification tasks. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category as deep neural networks are a popular tool in AI research and the paper proposes a defense strategy against attacks on these models. \n\ncs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a possible sub-category as the paper deals with the security of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with the robustness of deep neural networks, which is a key concern in the field of neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
