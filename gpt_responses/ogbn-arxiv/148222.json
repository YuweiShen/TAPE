The paper also compares the proposed method with other existing dropout methods on various image datasets, indicating a focus on computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper mentions the activation patterns of neurons in the human brain, suggesting a possible connection to cognitive science (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
