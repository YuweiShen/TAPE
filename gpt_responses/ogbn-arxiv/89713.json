The paper focuses on the efficiency of the agent and its ability to learn significantly faster than other state-of-the-art, general purpose deep reinforcement learning agents. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
