The paper proposes an end-to-end architecture that integrates face attributes for apparent age prediction with an additional loss for real age regression. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning techniques to improve age estimation, which suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the effect of gender, age, ethnic, makeup, and expression attributes of faces as sources of bias, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
