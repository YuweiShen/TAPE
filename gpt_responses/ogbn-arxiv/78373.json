The paper also focuses on complex-valued signals and channels, which are commonly studied in the fields of signal processing (cs.SP) and communication systems (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which is a topic of interest in the field of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of improperness of Gaussian distributed noise vectors, which is a topic of interest in the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
