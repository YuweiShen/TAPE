The paper also mentions the use of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and the departure from Bayesian methodology in traditional ensembling methods, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of ensembling in computer vision (cs.CV) and system engineering (cs.SY) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
