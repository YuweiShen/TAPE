The paper proposes a general framework for completing matrices that contain low-rank submatrices. This problem is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information theory (cs.IT). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
