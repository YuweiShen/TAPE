It also involves the fractional chromatic number of a graph, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) since it discusses the performance of different bounds. The use of optimization techniques to derive the bound may make it relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) as well. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI) since the Shannon capacity is a measure of the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
