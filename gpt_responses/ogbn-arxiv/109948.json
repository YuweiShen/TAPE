Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves the use of Gaussian perturbations and linear transformations, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.MM (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Systems and Control). The paper's focus on basic properties of mutual information suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the use of integration techniques and concavity inequalities points towards cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
