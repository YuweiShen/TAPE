This involves image processing, feature extraction, and classification, which are all core topics in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a novel approach to training the network using triplet loss and adaptive hard mining, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with security and privacy concerns related to biometric authentication, which could be classified under cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also involves experiments with different datasets, which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
