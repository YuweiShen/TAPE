The approach involves enforcing compile-time memory safety constraints at run-time, which involves both hardware and software components, making it relevant to computer architecture (cs.AR) and software engineering (cs.SE). The implementation is also discussed in terms of programming languages (cs.PL) and system-level design (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
