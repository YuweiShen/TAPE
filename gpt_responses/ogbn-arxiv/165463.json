The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for learning from noisy data, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of pairwise neural networks, which is a specific type of neural network architecture that falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on large face datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
