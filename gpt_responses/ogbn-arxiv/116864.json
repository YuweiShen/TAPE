The use of morphological operations and labeling is also a common technique in image processing and analysis (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for track counting (cs.IR), and the challenges of dealing with overlapping tracks (cs.DS, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
