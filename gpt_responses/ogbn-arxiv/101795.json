Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also involves computer vision techniques for image captioning, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another likely sub-category. The use of deep learning architectures and feature spaces makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves the use of automated algorithms for evaluation, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves the use of existing translation and English crowd-sourced sentences for training, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
