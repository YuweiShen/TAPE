The paper also presents an extension of the logic to the modal \u00b5-calculus, which is a formalism used in computer science for specifying and verifying properties of systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
