It also involves the use of a neural network, which is a common tool in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper mentions tasks such as head pose estimation and facial landmark detection, which are commonly studied in the computer vision community. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it discusses the use of a curriculum learning regime to improve the learned embedding. This suggests that the authors are interested in optimizing the performance of their model, which is a common goal in machine learning research. \n\nArtificial intelligence (cs.AI) is another likely sub-category as the paper involves the use of a neural network to learn a representation of facial attributes. This is a common application of artificial intelligence, and the paper may be of interest to researchers working on similar problems. \n\nMultimedia (cs.MM) is also a possible sub-category as the paper involves the analysis of videos of human faces. This suggests that the authors are interested in understanding how people move and express themselves, which is a topic that is relevant to multimedia research. \n\nFinally, natural language processing (cs.CL) is a less likely sub-category, but it is still possible that the paper could be of interest to researchers working on natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis or emotion detection.
