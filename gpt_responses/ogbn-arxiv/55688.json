The paper proposes a novel approach called Dialogue State Tracking via Question Answering (DSTQA) that uses a dynamically-evolving knowledge graph to explicitly learn relationships between (domain, slot) pairs. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Learning), cs.SD (Sound), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
