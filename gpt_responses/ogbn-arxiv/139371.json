The algorithms involve matrix manipulations and linear algebra techniques, which are common in numerical analysis and scientific computing. The paper also mentions partial linearization techniques, which are often used in computational algebraic geometry and symbolic computation (cs.NA). The algorithms are designed to handle matrices with balanced degrees and dimensions, which is a problem in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of divide and conquer approach, which is a common technique in control systems and robotics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the cost bound of the algorithms, which is a problem in optimization and operations research (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
