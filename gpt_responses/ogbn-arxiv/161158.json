This involves applying a finitary abstraction and an algorithm for bounded language inclusion modulo an independence relation. The approach is applied to device-driver programming, which involves calling the software interface of the device and the API provided by the operating system. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper presents a computer-aided programming approach to concurrency, which involves synthesizing synchronization to ensure correctness. This involves applying a finitary abstraction and an algorithm for bounded language inclusion modulo an independence relation. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a practical approach to device-driver programming, which involves calling the software interface of the device and the API provided by the operating system. The approach is more practical than the conventional approach based on user-provided assertions. \n- cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper applies the approach to device-driver programming, which involves calling the API provided by the operating system. The approach ensures correctness under a preemptive scheduler. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper involves applying an algorithm for bounded language inclusion modulo an independence relation, which is a logical concept. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a practical approach to device"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
