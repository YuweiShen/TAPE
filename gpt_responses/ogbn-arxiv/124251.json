The use of the generalized Haar condition (GHC) and the analysis of the sampling density required for reconstruction suggest that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). Finally, the focus on complex-generated and real-generated SISs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of shift-invariant systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
