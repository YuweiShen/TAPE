The use of automatic martingales involves concepts from information theory (cs.IT) and probability theory (cs.PR). The paper also discusses the dependence of randomness on the text, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the nonrandomness of automatic families of languages, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
