This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed method is a distributed method that uses several threads, each applying individual gradient descents on a local variable. This falls under the domain of distributed computing. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new way to share information between different threads inspired by gossip algorithms, which is a type of distributed algorithm. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with the training of convolutional networks, which is a type of neural network. This falls under the domain of neural computing. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper compares the proposed method to the recent EASGD on CIFAR-10, which is a dataset commonly used in computer vision. This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
