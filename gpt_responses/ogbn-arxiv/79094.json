The paper also discusses the impact of preprocessing techniques on iris recognition, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on iris recognition in unconstrained environments, which is a subfield of biometrics (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
