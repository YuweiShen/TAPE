This problem is addressed using a matrix exponential learning (MXL) algorithm, which has a high convergence rate but requires knowledge of the gradient matrix of the local utility at each transmitter. The paper proposes two strategies to decrease the informational exchange per iteration of the algorithm, and analyzes the convergence of the MXL algorithm under these strategies. The paper also applies the proposed algorithms to solve the energy efficiency maximization problem in a multicarrier multi-user MIMO network. Based on this description, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with learning algorithms and information exchange. The other possible sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), as the paper deals with resource allocation in networks and control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
