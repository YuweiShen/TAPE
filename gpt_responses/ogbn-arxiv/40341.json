This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed method involves using a cache memory, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the regularizing effect of the cache component, which is a concept commonly studied in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
