This makes it likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Game Theory (cs.GT) categories. The paper also proposes a proof of concept using a regular constraint solver, which suggests it could be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Finally, the paper deals with optimization problems, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
