This concept introduces correlations between subcarrier symbols, which can be exploited by the receiver to improve the bit error ratio performance. Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and signal processing, and hence this paper is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with a novel signaling concept in OFDM, which involves the use of a deterministic sequence in the guard interval. This concept introduces correlations between subcarrier symbols, which can be exploited by the receiver to improve the bit error ratio performance. Communications and networking is a sub-category that deals with the study of communication systems and signal processing, and hence this paper is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the development of linear data estimators specifically designed for UW-OFDM, some based on classical and some based on Bayesian estimation theory.
