This involves image processing and analysis, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper involves the detection of specific features (fluorescent security fibers) on identity documents, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The use of ultraviolet light to capture images of identity documents can be seen as a form of multimedia processing. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The detection of fluorescent security fibers is a security measure used in identity documents, which falls under the domain of cryptography and security. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The proposed solution involves ridge detection in the gray-scale image of the document with preliminary normalized background, which can be seen as a form of algorithmic approach to the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
