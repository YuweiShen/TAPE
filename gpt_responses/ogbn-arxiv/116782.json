This falls under the scope of algorithms and data structures. \n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper deals with lattice functions and constraints, which are topics in discrete mathematics. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Submodular functions are commonly used in machine learning for feature selection and other applications. The paper's focus on optimization of DR-submodular functions may be of interest to researchers in this field. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Similar to cs.LG, submodular functions are used in AI for various applications. The paper's focus on optimization of DR-submodular functions may be of interest to researchers in this field as well. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the running time of the reduction and the size of the resulting submodular instance, which are topics in computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
