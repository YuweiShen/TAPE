It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category as it discusses interpretability and continual learning. Additionally, it may fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category as it proposes a new approach to neural network architecture. The Systems and Control (cs.SY) category may also be relevant as the paper discusses the behavior of the network as a system. Finally, the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category may be relevant as the paper discusses the processing of different tasks by different clusters of neurons."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
