The use of automata to express security properties suggests a connection to formal methods (cs.SE) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the practical implementation of the proposed method involves generating and validating refinement relations, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
