This work is related to Information Retrieval (IR) and Computational Linguistics (CL) as it deals with textual data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It also involves machine learning algorithms, which are related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Learning (LG). Finally, the paper deals with similarity measures, which are related to Data Structures (DS).
