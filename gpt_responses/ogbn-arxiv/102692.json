Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information. The paper also proposes a DL framework for image sensor communication, which falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper discusses technical challenges and implementation issues, which are relevant to the categories of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
