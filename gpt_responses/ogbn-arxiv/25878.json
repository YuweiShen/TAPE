The proposed method also involves probabilistic modeling and learning, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The experiments are conducted on image datasets, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the potential applications of age estimation in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
