The use of reductions and approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of dominating sets and independent sets in graphs falls under the sub-categories of graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
