These are common techniques used in machine learning. \n3. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the problem of signal recovery from a small set of linear measurements, which is a common problem in signal processing. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly deal with social or information networks, but the techniques proposed in the paper could be applied to problems in these areas. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not deal with multimedia specifically, but the techniques proposed in the paper could be applied to problems in multimedia, such as image or video compression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
