Additionally, the use of recurrent neural networks and local competition mechanism suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The focus on improving localization accuracy suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of occlusion handling, which is a common issue in computer vision and may suggest that it belongs to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
