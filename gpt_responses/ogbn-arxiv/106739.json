This topic falls under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) which deals with the organization and retrieval of information from large datasets. The paper also mentions the use of algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) respectively. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of clustering algorithms which are commonly used in Data Mining (cs.DB) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IR, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.DB, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
