This is a problem that arises in many areas of computer science, including signal processing, machine learning, and information theory. The paper proposes new consistent subspace estimators for the case where the source signals are modelled as unknown deterministic signals. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Statistics (cs.ST) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
