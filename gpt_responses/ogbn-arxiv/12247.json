It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the development of algorithms that can learn to play Atari games. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it discusses the use of ES algorithms for optimization. The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques for playing Atari games, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for combining the strengths of ES and RL algorithms, which could place it under cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
