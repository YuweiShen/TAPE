The paper proposes a database repair approach to address fairness issues in the underlying data used to train machine learning models. This approach involves identifying admissible variables that can be used to ensure fairness, rather than relying on a complete causal model. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
