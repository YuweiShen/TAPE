The paper also mentions the practical application of demand response technology, which further supports the relevance of this paper to the CS sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), energy and power systems (cs.ET), computer engineering (cs.CE), and physics (cs.PHYS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
