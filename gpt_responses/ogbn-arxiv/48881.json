Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also introduces new network architecture and loss functions, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using image datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
