The paper proposes a distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithm that leverages the low-rank structure of its updates to achieve efficiency in time, memory, and communication usage. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Given the focus on machine learning and optimization, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, the paper also deals with distributed computing and optimization, which makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SC (Numerical Analysis) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also uses deep neural networks and deals with image data, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with large-scale datasets, which makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
