The paper proposes an online domain adaptation approach for multi-object tracking, which involves adapting object detectors from pre-trained models. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, but the most likely ones are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) since object tracking is a crucial component of many robotic systems. Finally, the paper deals with multimedia (cs.MM) since it involves processing videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
