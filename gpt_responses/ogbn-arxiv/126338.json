The paper also proposes a new approach called reverse-QA (rQA), which involves machines proactively raising questions and humans supplying answers, which can be classified into predefined answer-label categories. This involves the use of machine learning models such as interactive attention networks (IAN) and semi-interactive attention networks (Semi-IAN), which fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the evaluation of text classification models, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves the use of Chinese data sets, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) if deep learning models are used for analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
