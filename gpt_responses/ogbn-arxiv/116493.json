This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a paradigm shift in image classification by using an ensemble system of classifiers. This involves the use of machine learning techniques to combine the results of individual classifiers.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the retrieval of land cover information from satellite imagery using image classification algorithms.\n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the processing and analysis of satellite imagery, which can be considered a form of graphics.\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper does not explicitly mention distributed or parallel computing, but the use of an ensemble system of classifiers could potentially involve parallel processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
