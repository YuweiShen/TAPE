The use of sketches and approximations is also a common technique in data structures and algorithms. The focus on frequency moments and decreasing sums suggests a connection to data stream algorithms and information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). However, the paper also involves optimization and machine learning techniques, which could place it in sub-categories such as cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
