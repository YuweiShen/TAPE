The addition of fairness constraints and the use of an unknown similarity metric suggest that the paper may belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of weak feedback to identify fairness violations may also suggest the categories of cybersecurity (cs.CY) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the tension between profit and social policy may suggest the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
