The paper also explores the connection between two fairness notions, MNW and EFX, which are prominent concepts in game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an algorithm for constructing EFX allocations, which is a problem that falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the efficient computation of MNW allocations, which is a problem that involves designing algorithms and data structures. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a new interpretation of approximate EFX allocations, which is a concept that is related to machine learning. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with the problem of allocating indivisible goods among agents, which is a problem that involves discrete mathematics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
