The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of parallel sentence extraction on statistical machine translation, which could make it relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
