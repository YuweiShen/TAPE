It also involves the use of language models and phrase extraction, which are common techniques in natural language processing. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves the use of minimum error-rate training for a morpheme-level translation model. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category as machine translation is a common application of AI. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possibility as neural machine translation is a popular approach in recent years, although this paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural networks. \n\nFinally, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is a less likely possibility as the paper involves the evaluation of machine translation using BLEU and human judgments, which are common metrics in information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
