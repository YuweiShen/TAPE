The use of a dissimilarity function and the construction of an arm selection policy suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Lipschitz continuity and the analysis of regret bounds suggest that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the mention of minimax optimality suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
