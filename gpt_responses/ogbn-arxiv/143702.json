The paper discusses the use of deep learning technologies and labeled datasets to make progress in TSA. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also discusses data collection and annotation, which are important issues in machine learning, so cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. The use of deep learning models suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the different tasks and datasets related to TSA, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
