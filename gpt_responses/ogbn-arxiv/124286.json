Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a hierarchical transformer network, which is a deep learning model, so cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of data shortage, which is a common issue in NLP, so cs.SD (Sound) is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
