This suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) as the primary categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the advantages of MM programs over Excel files for the interchange of spreadsheets, which suggests a potential focus on databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions the potential for reducing error rates and code reuse, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
