Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the use of online learning for rate adaptation, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper focuses on optimizing video streaming in mobile networks, which could place it in cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
