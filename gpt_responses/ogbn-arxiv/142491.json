This topic falls under the broad area of information theory and communication systems, which is covered by the cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) sub-categories. The paper also considers the impact of antenna correlations, which is a common issue in wireless communication systems, and thus could be relevant to the cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) sub-category. The paper also discusses the outage probability and bit-error-rate, which are performance metrics commonly used in wireless communication systems, and thus could be relevant to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Signal Processing) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
