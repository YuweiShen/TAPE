This involves training a latent pivotal state model and a curiosity-driven goal-conditioned policy in a task-agnostic manner, and using a high-level Manager to quickly find solutions to new tasks and express subgoals in reference to pivotal states to a low-level Worker. The approach is evaluated on a suite of challenging maze tasks, which suggests a focus on reinforcement learning and robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a graph abstraction and the evaluation on maze tasks also suggest a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
