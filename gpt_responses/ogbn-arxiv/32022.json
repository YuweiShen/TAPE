Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also presents a greedy algorithm for computing a code achieving a $(1-e^{-1})$-approximation of the maximum success probability, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also discusses the use of submodular functions, which is a topic in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions the use of quantum entanglement, which is a topic in cs.ET (Emerging Technologies). Finally, the paper presents bounds on the one-shot performance of the meta-converse of Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdu, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
