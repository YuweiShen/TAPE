The proposed scheme also involves a unified encoder and decoder, which may fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper includes numerical analysis and simulation results, which may relate to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
