The paper also involves search-and-score algorithms, which are commonly used in data mining and machine learning (cs.DM). The use of the Cheeseman-Stutz asymptotic approximation and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm suggests a statistical inference approach, which is relevant to topics such as statistical learning and computational statistics (cs.SI). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on synthetic and real examples suggests a practical application in natural language processing or computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
