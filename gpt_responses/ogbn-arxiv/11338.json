The use of Markov-modulated channels and the exploration-exploitation trade-off suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. The analysis of the Whittle's Index Policy involves mathematical optimization, which could place the paper in the Mathematical Optimization (cs.MA) category.
