The paper also mentions specific CSPs such as Max-Cut and k-Correlation Clustering, which are commonly studied in the subfields of computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
