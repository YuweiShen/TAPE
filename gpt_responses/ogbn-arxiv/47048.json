This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new DRAM energy reduction mechanism called Voltron, which uses a performance model to determine the optimal supply voltage for energy efficiency without sacrificing performance. This involves system-level control and optimization, which falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.ARQ (Quantum Physics): This is unlikely, but possible, as the paper mentions \"bit errors\" in DRAM data due to reduced voltage. However, the context clearly indicates that this refers to classical bit errors and not quantum bit errors.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper deals with the energy efficiency of modern DRAM chips, which is an important aspect of emerging technologies in computing.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper discusses the trade-offs between voltage, latency, and reliability in DRAM chips and proposes a new energy reduction mechanism that balances these trade-offs to improve performance. This falls under the domain of performance optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
