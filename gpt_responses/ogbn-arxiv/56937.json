The use of simulated locomotion demonstrations and physically-realistic simulators suggests a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the proposed approach on complex tasks like multi-object stacking and non-rigid object manipulation suggests a potential focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
