The paper focuses on vision problems such as subspace clustering, weather artifact removal, and simultaneous multi-image alignment and rectification, indicating a strong connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The method involves matrix factorization and range propagation, which are common techniques in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data science (cs.DS). The paper also includes theoretical analysis and empirical results, suggesting a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
