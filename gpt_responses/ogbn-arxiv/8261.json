The specific application domain is molecular graph generation, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques. The model incorporates domain-specific rules, which suggests the involvement of structured information (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
