The method is also described as easy and quick, suggesting that it may be applicable in practical settings, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper focuses on training only the final classifier, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
