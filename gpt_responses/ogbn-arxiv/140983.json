Therefore, cs.HC is the most likely category. The paper also uses computer vision techniques to analyze the trajectories of vehicles, which suggests cs.CV as the second likely category. The paper also discusses the use of automation technology in vehicles, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the non-verbal communication between pedestrians and drivers, which is related to cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) and social intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
