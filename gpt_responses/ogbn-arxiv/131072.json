This involves information theory concepts such as signal detection and estimation. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The proposed method is specifically targeted for receivers with multiple-antenna capability, which is a networking and internet architecture concept. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the performance of the proposed method under different noise environments, which is a systems and control concept. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Cognitive radio networks involve security and privacy concerns, and the proposed method can be used for detecting the presence or absence of primary users, which is a security-related task. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is a multimedia concept as it involves processing of signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
