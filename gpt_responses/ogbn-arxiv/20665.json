Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a linear model and uses regression algorithms to predict content popularity, which falls under the scope of machine learning and data science. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely sub-categories.
