This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of iterative decoding algorithms, which is a common technique in coding theory and falls under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the properties of hierarchies of locally-optimal codewords, which can be seen as a type of data structure and falls under the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the inclusion properties of these hierarchies, which can be seen as a type of mathematical property and falls under the sub-category of mathematical software (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of maximum-likelihood certificates, which is a type of statistical inference and falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
