This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a self-contained system that does not require user input, which implies that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the hardware utilization and performance of the system, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
