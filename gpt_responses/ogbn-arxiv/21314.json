Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also uses control theory and optimization techniques, which suggest that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The use of game theory in the coordination solution could also place it in cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper presents a practical example involving three different SON functionalities, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
