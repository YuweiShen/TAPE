The paper focuses on policy search algorithms, which are commonly used in the subfield of Artificial Intelligence. The experiments are conducted on randomly generated Markov decision processes, which falls under the subfield of Data Structures. The paper also discusses the theoretical analysis of the proxy, which is related to the subfield of Systems and Control. Finally, the paper proposes a method for policy optimization, which is related to the subfield of Mathematical Optimization.
