The paper also proposes a novel protocol for relaying, which involves decision-making and optimization, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and relaying also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
