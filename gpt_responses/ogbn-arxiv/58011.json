The use of model checking and symmetry reduction techniques suggests a focus on formal methods (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also deals with the emergent behaviours of swarms, which can be seen as a complex system (cs.SY) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
