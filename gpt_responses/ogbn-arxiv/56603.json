Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves algebraic structures, such as skew-polynomial rings and left ideals, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of circulant matrices and their properties may also place the paper in cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
