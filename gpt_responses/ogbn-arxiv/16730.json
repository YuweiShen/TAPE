The proposed limited feedback algorithm and dimension switching algorithm involve system optimization and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions simulation results, which suggest the use of machine learning techniques (cs.MM) to improve the performance. Finally, the paper discusses the scaling of the required number of feedback bits, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
