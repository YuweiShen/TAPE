The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for phase retrieval and derives a general achievability bound for the compression rate. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories, as phase retrieval is a common problem in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
