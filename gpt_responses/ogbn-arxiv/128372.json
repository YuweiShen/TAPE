This topic is closely related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL), as well as human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY) in terms of designing tools that can better support developers. The use of semantic information also suggests a potential overlap with machine learning (cs.LG) in terms of developing algorithms that can learn from and make use of this information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
