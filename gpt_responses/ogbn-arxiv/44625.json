This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) domains. The use of transfer learning and regularization techniques also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the proposed method in medical imaging makes it relevant to the medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning models and neural networks in the proposed method suggests the involvement of the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NEURON) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
