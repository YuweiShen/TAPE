The paper also establishes new lower and upper bounds on the competitive ratio achievable by preemptive online algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
