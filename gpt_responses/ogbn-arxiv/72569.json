The use of omega-automata and omega-regularity also suggests a connection to formal languages (cs.FL) and computability theory (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of Blumensath's conjecture and recent results in the field suggests a possible connection to mathematical logic (cs.LM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
