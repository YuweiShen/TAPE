The focus is on filtering unwanted traffic at a router, which is a key component of networking and Internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - DDoS attacks are a security threat, and the paper proposes a mechanism to mitigate them. The problem of optimal allocation of filters to attack sources involves security considerations, such as identifying and blocking malicious traffic. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - DDoS attacks involve a large number of compromised hosts sending unwanted traffic to a victim, which can be seen as a distributed computing problem. The paper proposes a solution to efficiently allocate filtering resources to mitigate the attack. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The problem of optimal allocation of filters to attack sources can be seen as a control problem, where the goal is to maximize the amount of good traffic preserved while minimizing the impact of the attack. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a dynamic programming approach to solve the optimization problem of filter allocation, which involves a search for the optimal solution among a large number of possible allocations. This can be seen as an AI problem, where the algorithm learns to make optimal decisions based on"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
