Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions the use of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, which is a topic related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of non-congestion related packet losses on TCP performance, which could fall under cs.COMM (Computers and Society) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper proposes a new network layer, which could also be related to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
