The paper also focuses on the real-time requirements of such communication, which suggests a potential fit with the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.CR). The use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) also involves control and optimization of network resources, which could be classified under the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the mapping of protocols, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the resilience, security, and adaptivity of the automotive environment, which could be classified under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
