This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and robotics (cs.RO). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper. Among them, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most relevant ones as the paper deals with model training and evaluation on image datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
