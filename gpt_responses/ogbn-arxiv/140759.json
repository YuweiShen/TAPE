This topic falls under the intersection of computer security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed methodology involves embedding the owner's signature in the probability density function of the data abstraction obtained in different layers of a DL model, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various neural network architectures, which falls under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
