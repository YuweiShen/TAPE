The paper proposes a technique to compute the optimal solution of the game and derives a generalized minimax Q-learning algorithm. This makes cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal policy when the model information is not known. This falls under the scope of AI and hence, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal policy. This falls under the scope of machine learning and hence, cs.LG is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of Markov games and proposes a technique to compute the optimal solution. This falls under the scope of systems and control and hence, cs.SY is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a technique to compute the optimal solution of the game.
