The use of neural probabilistic language models (such as word2vec) and matrix factorization (such as GloVe) also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the potential applications of these embeddings in information retrieval (cs.IR) and social media analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
