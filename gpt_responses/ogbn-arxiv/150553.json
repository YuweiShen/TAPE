This is a clear indication of the paper belonging to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper develops a robust model predictive framework to plan controls optimally, which involves machine learning techniques.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses signal temporal logic (STL) to describe specifications, which is a formalism used in AI for reasoning about temporal properties.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the techniques developed in the paper can be applied to control robotic systems subject to disturbances.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper provides an efficient method to compute robust control invariant sets in high dimensions, which involves developing algorithms for set-invariance theories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
