The paper also proposes a relay path selection algorithm and a multi-hop transmission scheduling algorithm, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The issue of blockage in mmWave communications is a security concern (cs.CR), and the proposed scheme involves optimizing network performance (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
