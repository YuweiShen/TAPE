The proposed system uses complex event processing (CEP) to predict and avoid collisions, which involves the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also involves coordination and communication between multiple UAVs, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also mentions the use of geographical locations and obstacle detection, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability and efficiency of the proposed system, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
