The paper focuses on reducing the computational and memory requirements for data embedding, which is a key aspect of machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
