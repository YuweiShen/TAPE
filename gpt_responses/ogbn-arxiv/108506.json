The paper also focuses on object detection, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of an online planning algorithm and machine learning techniques suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as possible categories. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of robustness, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
