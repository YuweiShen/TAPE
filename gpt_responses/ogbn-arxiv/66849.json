The use of function approximation also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on exploration and visit-counters relates to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the demonstration of the approach on Atari games suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
