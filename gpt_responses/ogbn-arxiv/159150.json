The paper also mentions skeleton extraction and skeleton-driven animation, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV) fields. The paper proposes a distortion metric function to quantify surface curviness, which involves computational geometry (cs.CG) concepts. Finally, the paper's focus on accuracy and robustness in 3D skeleton detection or tracking applications suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
