The paper proposes a new local consistency technique called soft bounds arc consistency (BAC), which is a refinement of soft arc consistency, a widely used technique in constraint programming. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as well. The paper also discusses the time and space complexity of the proposed technique, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and theoretical computer science (cs.DM). Finally, the paper applies the proposed technique to solve two real-world problems, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
