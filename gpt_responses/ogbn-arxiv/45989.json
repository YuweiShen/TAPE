The use of spectral features and matrix factorization also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the optimization of models, which could fall under the optimization and control (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of hypergraph structures and similarity measures suggests a data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
