This makes cs.CR the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): While not the main focus of the paper, the use of Federated Identity Management (FIdM) systems to improve user authentication and privacy could be seen as a form of information retrieval.\n\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with IoT applications, which are inherently networked, and proposes a new authentication protocol that reduces data exchange overhead. This makes cs.NI a likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new federated identity authentication protocol for IoT that is tailored to the specific needs of IoT applications. This could be seen as a form of software engineering.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new authentication protocol that is designed to run efficiently on resource-constrained devices like Arduino. This could be seen as a form of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
