This concept involves the use of communication, sensing, and collaboration among these entities, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in IoBT to enable intelligent decision-making and collaboration among entities. The paper also discusses the challenges of security (cs.CR) in IoBT, as well as the need for software engineering (cs.SE) approaches to develop flexible and adaptive communication systems. Finally, the paper discusses the need for system-level approaches (cs.SY) to design and implement IoBT systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
