The paper proposes an analytical framework for studying parallel repetition and uses it to prove new results related to the value of projection games and the inapproximability of Set-Cover and Label-Cover problems. This makes cs.CC (Computational Complexity) the most likely category. The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.CG) concepts. Finally, the paper deals with game theory (cs.GT) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
