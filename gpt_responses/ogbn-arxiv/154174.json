The specific application is in microscopical images, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of speed-up robust features (SURF), which is a popular feature detection algorithm used in image retrieval (cs.IR) and graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper proposes a method for integrating information from multiple images, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
