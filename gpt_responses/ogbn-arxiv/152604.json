It also involves object detection, which is a common topic in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning, specifically deep learning, as it uses state-of-the-art single-model detectors (SSD and MS-CNN) and an end-to-end training procedure. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also deals with multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves video smoke detection. Finally, it may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as it mentions the superiority of detectors based on adversarial adaptation over those based on discrepancy adaptation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
