The paper also investigates factors that affect the performance of fine-tuning, which is a problem of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of fine-tuning on various benchmarks, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
