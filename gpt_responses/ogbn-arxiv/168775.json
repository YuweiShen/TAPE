It presents an augmented approach that uses LiDAR and cameras to scan street scenes and generate plausible traffic flows for cars and pedestrians. The resulting images are photorealistic and fully annotated, and are used for training and testing of AD systems from perception to planning. Given the focus on computer vision and robotics, as well as the use of data-driven algorithms, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for various AD tasks, which suggests additional likely sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves graphics and rendering techniques, which could place it in the cs.GR (Computer Graphics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
