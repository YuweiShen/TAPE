The package can be used for automatic generation of difference schemes for linear partial differential equations, which falls under the category of dynamical systems (cs.DS) and computational mathematics (cs.CA). The reduction of multiloop Feynman integrals is a topic related to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
