This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically relates to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with image classification. The method involves penalizing the magnitude of activations during training, which is a technique commonly used in neural network regularization (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the effect of the proposed method on label randomization tests and cumulative ablations, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and other machine learning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
