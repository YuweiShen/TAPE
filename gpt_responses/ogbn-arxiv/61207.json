The paper also discusses various choices and optimizations made in the framework, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of multiple scales and convolutional activations also suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
