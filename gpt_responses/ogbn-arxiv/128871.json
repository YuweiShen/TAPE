This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of uncertainty estimates and their application to medical imaging tasks suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
