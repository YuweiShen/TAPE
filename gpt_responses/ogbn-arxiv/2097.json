This involves analyzing large datasets of yield performances of corn hybrids planted in different locations over several years. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on various machine learning techniques, including deep learning, which is used in the paper's approach.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers research on computer vision and image processing, which are relevant to the paper's use of convolutional neural networks.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, which is used in the paper's approach.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers research on neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are relevant to the paper's use of deep convolutional neural networks.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category covers research on social and information networks, which are not directly related to the paper's approach but may be relevant to the analysis of the large datasets used in the study."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
