The focus of the paper is on the design and implementation of the language server, which involves adapting existing tools to better support incrementality, incompleteness, and error handling. The paper also discusses the challenges of building good editor support for expressive programming languages and frustrating tooling ecosystems, which are relevant to software engineering and computational linguistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
