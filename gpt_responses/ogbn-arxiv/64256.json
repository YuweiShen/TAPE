Additionally, the paper discusses the use of CNNs as a base structure for the proposed system, which is a common technique in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a new technique for constructing CNNs that can produce quantitatively identical output results based on either transformationally invariant operators or symmetric operations. \n\nThe paper's focus on producing consistent results based on input rotations suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category, which often deals with problems related to perception and reasoning. \n\nThe paper's use of mathematical techniques and the study of different GRI-CNN structures may also make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on developing a new type of CNN system may also make it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which often deals with the processing and analysis of visual and audio data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
