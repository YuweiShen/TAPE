The paper also uses notions of rigidity and matroids, which are topics in graph theory (cs.GT) and combinatorial optimization (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the use of genericity and convexity, which are topics in computational complexity (cs.CC) and optimization (cs.NA). Finally, the paper uses concepts from distance geometry, which is a topic in scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
