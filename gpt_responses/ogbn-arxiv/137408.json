The paper focuses on high-dimensional images, which suggests that it may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. However, the method is based on leveraging in-batch dependencies, which is a machine learning technique and could fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), or neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of traditional OoD detection methods, which could also place it in the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
