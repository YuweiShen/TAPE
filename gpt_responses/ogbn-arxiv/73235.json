The paper uses techniques from graph theory and sampling, which are common in computer science. The applications of the method are in news and video summarization, which are related to computer vision and information retrieval. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
