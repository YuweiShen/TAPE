The use of spectral signatures based on the graph Laplacian suggests that the paper may also be relevant to spectral graph theory (cs.DM) and signal processing (cs.IT). Finally, the introduction of new compatibility terms for the integer quadratic program formulation may be of interest to researchers working on optimization problems in various fields, including information theory (cs.IT) and statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
