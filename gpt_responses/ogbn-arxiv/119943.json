The technique involves depositing photopolymers and a non-curing liquid to create complex fluidic channels, which also involves aspects of mechanical engineering (cs.ME) and materials science (cs.MM). The paper also showcases the printing of soft grippers and a hexapod robot, which involves aspects of electronic engineering (cs.ET) and electromagnetics (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
