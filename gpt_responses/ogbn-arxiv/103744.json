The use of randomized algorithms and competitive analysis suggests that the paper belongs to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) categories. The mention of maximizing total value and the use of hazard rate distributions suggest that the paper may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories.
