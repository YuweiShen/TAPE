The paper also discusses the trade-off between design minimum distance, number of errors, and acceptable list size, which are concepts commonly studied in coding theory (cs.DS). The paper also uses asymptotic analysis to find the uncertainty associated with multiple strings, which is a common technique in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the use of list-decoding to decrease coding redundancy and the required number of reads, which are topics commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
