The paper also discusses the trade-off between accuracy and speed, which is a common concern in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the proposed algorithm involves ranking and pruning filters, which is a technique commonly used in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
