The paper also discusses interference models and SNR-to-rate mappings, which are topics commonly studied in information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a distributed implementation for local optimization, which falls under the subfield of control systems (cs.SY). The simulations presented in the paper involve heterogeneous networks and power reduction, which are topics commonly studied in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
