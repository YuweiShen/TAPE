The paper also discusses the ambiguity introduced by quantized distances, which is a security concern and falls under the category of \"Cryptography and Security\" (cs.CR). The paper also mentions empirical data and state-of-the-art systems, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and multimedia (cs.MM).
