The paper focuses on reducing user fatigue and improving convergence speed, which are important factors in IEC. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Additionally, the paper uses Differential Evolution (DE) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), which are common techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Cybernetics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using simulations, which is a common technique in Computational Engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
