The use of spatial pooling also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component to the approach. Additionally, the direct optimization of the partial area under the ROC curve measure may indicate an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) focus. The use of low-level visual features and the improvement in detection performance may also suggest a neural networks (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
