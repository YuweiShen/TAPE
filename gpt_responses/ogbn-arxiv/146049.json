This involves the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture long-range contextual cues and temporal dependencies. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers on the development and analysis of machine learning algorithms, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers on image and video analysis, which is relevant to the use of facial expressions for emotion recognition. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. The paper's focus on deep learning and emotion recognition falls under this category. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers on neural networks and related algorithms, which is relevant to the use of RNNs in the proposed framework. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category covers papers on the design and evaluation of interactive systems, which is relevant to the application of emotion recognition in human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
