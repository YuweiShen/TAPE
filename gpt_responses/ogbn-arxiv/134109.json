It discusses how knowledge of a classifier's AUC on the test set can constrain the set of possible ground-truth labelings. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, but the most likely ones are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
