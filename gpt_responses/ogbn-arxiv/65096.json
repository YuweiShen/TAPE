The methodology used involves scanning a large dataset of IP/port combinations, which suggests a focus on network security (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the difficulty of securing server-to-server communication, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE). The analysis of TLS certificates and trust anchors relates to cryptography (cs.CY), and the use of commodity hardware and open-source software suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
