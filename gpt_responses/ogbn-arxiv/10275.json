This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY). Given the focus on deep RL and modeling the environment, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely categories. However, since the tasks involve robotic control and long-term memorization, cs.RO and cs.SY are also likely categories. Finally, since the paper uses raw observations as input, cs.CV is a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
