This involves managing intra-cluster interference (ICRI) and intercell-interference (ICI) and accounting for the limitations of imperfect NOMA schemes. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with managing interference and optimizing power and bandwidth allocation, which are key topics in information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on downlink HetNets and proposes a distributed approach for cluster formation and resource allocation, which are relevant topics in networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a distributed approach for cluster formation and resource allocation, which can be seen as a social network of base stations (BSs) interacting with each other. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with managing interference and optimizing resource allocation, which are relevant topics in multimedia communication. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes a matching-based approach for cluster formation, which is a topic in game theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
