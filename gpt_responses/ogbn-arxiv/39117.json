The paper also presents a new algorithm that uses verification techniques, which involves computational aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also involves searching and optimization techniques, which are part of computer science and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses theoretical guarantees and upper bounds, which are part of machine learning and statistical analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents an open-source code that can be used for various applications, which falls under multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
