The use of attentional mechanisms and neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of datasets such as LFW, YTF, and IJB-A suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of bilinear attention networks suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
