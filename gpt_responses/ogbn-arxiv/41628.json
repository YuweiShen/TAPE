It also involves the use of deep neural networks for image processing, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of masks and fine-grained information suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed ranking loss function and the focus on mitigating interference from similar negative samples suggest that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Lastly, the potential security implications of person retrieval suggest that it may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
