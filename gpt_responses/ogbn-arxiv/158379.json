It also involves machine learning techniques for combining automatic metrics and human evaluation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of current automatic metrics and the need for improving them, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the cost of human evaluation and the potential for reducing it, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
