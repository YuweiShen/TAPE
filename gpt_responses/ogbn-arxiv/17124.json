Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning models, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia), and gradient boosted decision trees, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the implications for video search, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
