This falls under the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses concepts related to functional programming, such as free monads and containers, which are relevant to Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). The paper also touches upon software verification, which is a topic in Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq, which is relevant to Computational Logic (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
