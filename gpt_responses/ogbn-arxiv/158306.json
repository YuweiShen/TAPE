Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper deals with classification datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The experiments involve image classification, which could place it in cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the use of normalization techniques, which could suggest it belongs to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
