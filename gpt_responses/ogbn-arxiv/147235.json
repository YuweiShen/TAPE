This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and network information theory (cs.ITP). The paper also addresses antenna configurations, which could fall under the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The study of DoF regions in MIMO systems is also related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
