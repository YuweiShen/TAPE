However, the focus is on the computational aspects of the problem, which suggests a connection to computer science. The paper also discusses the use of samples from an unknown distribution, which is a common theme in information theory (cs.IT). The problem of optimal stopping can be viewed as a decision problem, which is a topic in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of inequalities, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper involves analyzing the performance of algorithms, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
