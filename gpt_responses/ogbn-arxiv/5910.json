The use of polar codes for channel coding and source coding is a common technique in communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of CRC codes, which are commonly used in error correction (cs.SI). The analysis of the size and scaling of the set of frozen channel code bits is a mathematical problem, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes an improved scheme for communication over binary DP, which involves optimization and algorithm design (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
