Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves training deep neural networks, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The task of signature verification also involves security and cryptography, which could be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper proposes improvements to feature representations, which could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
