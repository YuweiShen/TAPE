The paper proposes a novel nonlinear feature selection method using a concrete neural network architecture. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with biological data, which suggests that it could also belong to the q-bio sub-category. Specifically, q-bio.QM (Quantitative Methods) and q-bio.GN (Genomics) are likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
