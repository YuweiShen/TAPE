The paper also discusses the security level provided by the proposed protocol. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with IoT networks and the communication overhead involved in attesting a swarm of devices. The proposed protocol aims to minimize this overhead while maintaining an adequate level of security. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a protocol for attesting a swarm of devices, which involves controlling the communication between the devices and the verifier. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses a protocol for attesting a swarm of devices, which involves organizing the devices into fine-grained multi-clusters. This requires distributed computing and communication between the devices. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a software-based solution for attesting IoT devices, which involves verifying the software integrity of a potentially compromised remote device."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
