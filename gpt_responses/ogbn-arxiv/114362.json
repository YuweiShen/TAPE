The paper proposes two complementary approaches for this problem, one of which involves using adversarial example generators to incorporate large lexical resources in entailment models via only a handful of rule templates. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a GAN-style approach for training the entailment model, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
