It heavily relies on the theory of random geometric graphs (cs.CG) and uses concepts from computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of sampling-based planners, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
