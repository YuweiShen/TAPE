Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the analysis of worst-case complexity bounds, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The practical geometric constraints mentioned in the abstract suggest that it could also belong to cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
