This makes it likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The $\\lambda$-calculus is also closely related to functional programming languages, which makes it likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses how to perform computations and define recursive functions, which makes it relevant to the Theory of Computation (cs.TL) sub-category. Additionally, the $\\lambda$-calculus is a foundational concept in the field of functional programming, which makes it relevant to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the paper provides a tutorial introduction to the $\\lambda$-calculus, which makes it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
