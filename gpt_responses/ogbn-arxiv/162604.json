It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a novel decomposition strategy for solving the joint extraction task using a single model. Additionally, it may be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the task of entity and relation extraction is important for information retrieval systems. Finally, it may also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the proposed model uses neural networks for solving the sequence labeling problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
