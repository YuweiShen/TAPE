The use of shortest paths and distance functions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of obstacle representations and embeddings is related to graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper's focus on providing a generalized model for different types of embeddings suggests that it may also be relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
