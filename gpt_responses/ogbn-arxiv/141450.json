The proposed method involves learning a representation using regularization and optimization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). The experimental results are obtained on benchmarking datasets, which are often used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
