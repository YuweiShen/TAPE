The paper also discusses the extension of the formalism to other programming languages. Therefore, cs.PL is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the development of a formal memory framework and an extension of Curry-Howard isomorphism for Solidity, which can be relevant to the security and correctness of smart contracts. Therefore, cs.CR is also a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a formal syntax and semantics for Solidity, which can be useful for software engineering tasks such as program analysis, verification, and testing. Therefore, cs.SE is another likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the extension of Curry-Howard isomorphism, which is a fundamental connection between logic and programming languages. Therefore, cs.LO is also a possible sub-category for this paper.\n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on the Solidity programming language, which is used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Therefore, cs.DC is"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
