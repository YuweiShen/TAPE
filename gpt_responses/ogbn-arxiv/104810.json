This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG) or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses Givens rotations and the absolute value function as non-linearities, which are techniques commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the copy problem, which is a common benchmark in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
