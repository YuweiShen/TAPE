The paper proposes a deep neural network method based on attention mechanism to identify different aspect categories of a given review sentence. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to research on computational models of natural language and their applications. \n\nThe paper also utilizes deep learning approaches, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFurthermore, the paper deals with text classification, which is a common task in information retrieval (IR). Therefore, it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a novel approach that outperforms existing methods, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.CC (Computational Complexity), which deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and computational systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
