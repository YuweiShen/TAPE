Given that the paper focuses on the fundamental limits of online and distributed algorithms for statistical learning and estimation, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG), followed by distributed computing (cs.DC), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
