It could also potentially belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves improving the performance of language models through a modification to the attention mechanism. Additionally, it may be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it involves neural network architectures, and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the talking-heads attention mechanism involves linear projections which are commonly used in computer vision tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
