The use of contract theory to design incentive-compatible contracts for relays suggests a game-theoretic approach, which is also relevant to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The paper also proposes a heuristic relay selection scheme, which involves optimization and decision-making, making it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
