The focus on learning tree-structured models suggests that it may also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV), where tree structures are often used to represent hierarchical relationships. Finally, the use of a novel regularizer and optimization procedure suggests that this paper may also be relevant to optimization and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
