Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely categories. The paper also leverages motion flow information and attention network, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
