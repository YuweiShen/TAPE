The paper also proposes a novel model called UIC that combines utility-driven item adoption with influence propagation over networks, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the problem of maximizing social welfare, which is related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
