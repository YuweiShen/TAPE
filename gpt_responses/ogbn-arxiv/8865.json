The paper uses data from two long-term studies and tests multiple algorithms and learning process configurations to identify the best performing machine learning models. The paper also examines the behavior of the best models with respect to prediction errors and the impact of used features to confirm their clinical relevance. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
