The use of HARQ also suggests the relevance of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the throughput and outage probability of RF-FSO links, which are important metrics in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper may fall under this category as it does not fit into any specific sub-category of computer science. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of millimeter wave in the RF link, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper may also fall under this category as it involves the analysis of system performance and the effect of different parameters on the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
