The paper also uses techniques from error-control coding, which is a subfield of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a problem in a network setting, specifically a noisy broadcast sensor network. The paper proposes in-network computing strategies to minimize the number of broadcasts. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes distributed encoding techniques, called graph codes, for the three different scenarios considered in the paper. The paper also proposes in-network computing strategies to minimize the number of broadcasts. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with a control problem, specifically the problem of collecting all sensor measurements at a sink node in a noisy broadcast sensor network. The paper proposes in-network computing strategies to achieve an upper bound within a factor of log N of the fundamental limits. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes graph codes as a distributed encoding technique for the three different scenarios considered in the paper. The paper also proposes in-network computing strategies to minimize the number of broadcasts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
