The branch-and-bound algorithm used in the paper involves searching through a large space of possible solutions, which is a common technique in discrete optimization (cs.DS). The cutting-plane approach used for obtaining lower bounds is a technique in convex optimization (cs.DC). The paper also deals with error-correcting codes, which is a topic in systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves comparing the performance of different algorithms, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
