The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also mentioned. The demonstration of the AD system on a modified vehicle suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning algorithms (cs.LG). Finally, the overall system architecture and the need for further investigation for full-scale roll-out suggest a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
