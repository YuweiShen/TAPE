This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). However, given that the paper focuses on automatic feature learning using recurrent neural networks, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category.
