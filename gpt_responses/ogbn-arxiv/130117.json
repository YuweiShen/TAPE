The use of BLEU score as a non-differentiable metric suggests that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The proposed method for calculating a differentiable lower bound involves optimization, which is a common topic in machine learning and deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the use of optimization and surrogate loss functions suggests that this paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The lower bound calculation may involve image processing, which could place this paper under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) concepts in the paper may suggest that it could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
