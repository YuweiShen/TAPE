This is a common topic in logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with the evaluation of programs in a specific programming language (System F with control operators) and introduces novel polymorphic type systems. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the programming languages sub-category.\n- cs.TL (Type Theory): The paper introduces novel polymorphic type systems for control operators, which is a topic closely related to type theory.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper deals with the correctness of program evaluation, which is a key concern in software engineering.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper presents a formal proof of termination of evaluation in reduction semantics, which is a topic closely related to formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
