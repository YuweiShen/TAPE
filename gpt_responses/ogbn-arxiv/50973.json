It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it focuses on neural networks. Additionally, since the paper deals with complex-valued data, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as these fields often deal with complex data. Finally, since the paper proposes a new method for activation functions, it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as this sub-category deals with the design of algorithms for network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
