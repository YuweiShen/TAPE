The method is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph embedding, and provides theoretical guarantees for the representation capability. These characteristics suggest that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
