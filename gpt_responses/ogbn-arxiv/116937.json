This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves learning low-dimensional vector representations of graph vertices. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a novel graph softmax function, which could potentially fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on real-world datasets, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV) depending on the specific applications used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
