Attention models are also used in various other domains such as computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, attention models are a type of neural network architecture (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
