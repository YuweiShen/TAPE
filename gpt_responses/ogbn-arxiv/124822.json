The method involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The approach also involves retrieval of relevant instances using locality sensitive hashing, which is a technique commonly used in Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on news classification datasets, which can be considered as a subfield of Computer Vision (cs.CV) where text is treated as an image."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
