This suggests that the paper belongs to the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes probabilistic methods to improve NLI models, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed methods involves training and testing on different datasets, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of visual information in some NLI datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes methods to fine-tune models on target datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
