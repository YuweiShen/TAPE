This involves fine-grained labeling of roadway features in street-level panoramas, which suggests the paper could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of a neural network also suggests the paper could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the estimation of road curvature and roadside hazards, which suggests it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper addresses the task of road safety assessment, which could fall under the computer and society (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
