Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of sampling without replacement, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms, suggesting possible categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The mention of theoretical convergence rates suggests a possible category of cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and the mention of empirical results suggests a possible category of cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
