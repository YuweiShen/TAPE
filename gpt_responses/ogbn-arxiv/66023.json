Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM) aspects. Finally, the paper also involves statistical analysis and pattern recognition (cs.SD) to evaluate the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
