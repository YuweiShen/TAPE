The use of partial differential equations (PDEs) to solve these problems is a novel approach that is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
