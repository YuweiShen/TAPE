This is a classic problem in information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI), where the goal is to optimize the use of limited resources to achieve the best possible performance. The paper also discusses the trade-off between multi-user diversity and accurate channel information, which is a topic of interest in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper has implications for system design (cs.CE), as it suggests a preference for acquiring high-quality feedback from a few users rather than coarse feedback from many users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
