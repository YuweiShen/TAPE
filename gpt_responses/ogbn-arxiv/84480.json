The proposed tool, SmartEmbed, is based on code embeddings and similarity checking techniques, which are related to programming languages (cs.PL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential for large-scale studies of smart contracts, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
