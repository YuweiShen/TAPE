The use of instance-rich information and distances to centres of mass suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Additionally, the application of the method to multiple tissue types and the introduction of a new dataset suggests a potential focus on multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
