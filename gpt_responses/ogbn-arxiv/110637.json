The use of a multi-objective prediction framework and crowd-sourcing also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the algorithm to mobile devices and embedded systems may also relate to the sub-categories of augmented reality (cs.AR) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
