The method uses genetic algorithms, which is a popular optimization technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions that the proposed algorithm is capable of discovering a promising architecture of a CNN, which can be considered as a system identification problem, falling under systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
