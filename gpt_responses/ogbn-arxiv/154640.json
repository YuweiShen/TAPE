This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of asymmetric convolutions, which are a common technique in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural Networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on image classification tasks, which is a common application in Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
