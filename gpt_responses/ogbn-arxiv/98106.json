Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial and graph-theoretic arguments, which suggest cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as likely sub-categories. The use of geometric methods and the study of geometric objects such as Schubert varieties and flag varieties suggest cs.GT (Geometric Topology) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the study of nonvanishing of coefficients, which is related to algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics, suggesting cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
