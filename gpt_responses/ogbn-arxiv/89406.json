The proposed model is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained word vectors, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and NLP (cs.CL).
