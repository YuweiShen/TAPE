This suggests that the paper is related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. The paper also mentions the decision boundary, which is a concept commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the integration of external constraints, which is a topic relevant to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
