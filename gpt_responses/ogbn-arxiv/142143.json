The paper also discusses the use of L1-norm-based two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis (L1-(2D)2PCA), which is a machine learning technique, indicating that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of binary hashing and block-wise histogram for pooling, which are techniques commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the proposed network to outliers and changes in training images, which suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
