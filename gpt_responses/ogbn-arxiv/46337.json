The paper also discusses the optimization process of evolution, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The modification to traditional reinforcement learning introduced in the paper involves limiting the agent's ability to observe the real environment, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the emerged world model helping the agent learn key skills, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
