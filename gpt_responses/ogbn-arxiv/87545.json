The paper proposes a new algorithm for tracking, which involves the use of kernelized correlation filters, a technique that is commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
