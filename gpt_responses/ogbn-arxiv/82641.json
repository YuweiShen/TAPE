Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of technology to address the challenges of low-resource scenarios and distant languages. This falls under the scope of AI research.\n\n3. cs.LG (Learning): The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to develop NLP systems for indigenous languages. Therefore, cs.LG is a likely category.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the importance of linguistic diversity and the need for NLP research in linguistically rich areas. This falls under the scope of computers and society.\n\n5. cs.DL (Digital Libraries): The paper discusses the availability of digital resources for indigenous languages. Therefore, cs.DL is a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
