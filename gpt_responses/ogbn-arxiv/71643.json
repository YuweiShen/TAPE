The use of local backhaul links also suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of communication and information theory (cs.IT). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) due to the use of dirty-paper precoding. Finally, the mention of hexagonal cellular network topology and quantized versions of signals suggests a possible connection to the sub-categories of computer engineering (cs.CE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
