It proposes varifolds as an alternative representation for nonoriented shapes. This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories, as these fields deal with shape representation and analysis. The paper also mentions geometric measure theory, which falls under the discrete geometry (cs.DG) sub-category. The use of varifolds for numerical encoding suggests it could also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the mention of diffeomorphic registration suggests it could also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
