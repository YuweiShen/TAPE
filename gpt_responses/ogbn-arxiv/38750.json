The use of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the integration of an attention mechanism is a popular technique in deep learning, which could place this paper in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of lexicons also suggests that this paper could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
