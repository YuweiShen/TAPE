It also uses contrast sensitivity formulations of retinal ganglion cells to obtain perceptual feature maps, which is a common technique in computer vision. The paper also involves some information theory (cs.IT) as it uses the Earth Mover's Distance to measure significant color degradations. Additionally, the paper involves some machine learning (cs.MM) as it uses probability vectors to measure color differences. The paper also involves some human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it quantifies perceptual color degradations rather than absolute pixel-wise changes. Finally, the paper involves some machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a quality estimator based on color, structure, and visual system characteristics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
