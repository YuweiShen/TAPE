The use of local rewiring rules to increase clustering is a technique often used in the subfield of social network analysis (cs.SI) and network science (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the growth of a small world, which is a concept studied in the subfield of graph theory (cs.DS) and complex systems (cs.SD). Finally, the algorithms presented rely on preserving other network properties, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
