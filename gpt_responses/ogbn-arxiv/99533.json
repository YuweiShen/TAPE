This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses interference creation and resurrection, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves mathematical modeling and analysis, which could fall under the computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE) sub-category, as well as multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of figures and graphs to illustrate the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
