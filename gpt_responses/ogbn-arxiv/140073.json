This involves addressing issues such as undisclosed channel balances and mismatched transaction fees. The paper also proposes a generic technique called Boomerang to construct redundant payment paths free of counterparty risk. The implementation of Boomerang involves Bitcoin Script, which suggests a focus on cryptography and network security (cs.CR). The paper also deals with network infrastructure and protocols (cs.NI), distributed computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG) in terms of the routing schemes used and the experiments conducted."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
