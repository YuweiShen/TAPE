The proposed method involves using a CNN to represent the cost function, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of abstract representations and semantic enrichment, which are topics in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the method to hybrid driving-stepping locomotion, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
