This involves machine learning techniques such as one-class classifiers and unsupervised/semi-supervised learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with anomaly and outlier detection, sub-categories such as cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
