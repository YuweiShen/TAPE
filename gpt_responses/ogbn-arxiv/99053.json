The paper proposes a novel module that introduces high-order character language models to attention mechanism, which involves natural language processing techniques, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category. The paper proposes a new module that improves the performance of existing attentional methods, which involves machine learning techniques, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper proposes a new module that improves the robustness of existing attentional methods, which involves artificial intelligence techniques, hence it is also likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category.
