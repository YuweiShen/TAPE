Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely category for this paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): As mentioned above, machine learning techniques are used in WSD, which makes cs.LG a possible category for this paper. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): WSD can also be used in information retrieval systems to improve search results by disambiguating query terms. Therefore, cs.IR is another possible category. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Deep learning techniques, which fall under the scope of cs.NE, have been used in recent works on WSD. Therefore, cs.NE is also a possible category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
