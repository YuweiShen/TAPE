The use of supplemental data and the need to develop models with data from varying sources suggests that the paper may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the optimization techniques developed in the paper may also be relevant to the broader field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
