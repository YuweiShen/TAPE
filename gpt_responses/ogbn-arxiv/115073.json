This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The proposed SketchTransfer task involves transferring sketches between domains, which is also relevant to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
