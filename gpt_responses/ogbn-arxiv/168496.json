Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the use of HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) processes to counteract fading-induced outages, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper discusses the interplay between caching and transmission, which is related to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper involves the use of numerical simulations to demonstrate the benefits of fractional caching, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
