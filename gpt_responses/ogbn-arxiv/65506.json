The use of 1-bit-per-weight for deployment on resource-constrained embedded hardware suggests a focus on optimization and efficiency, which is often studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. The approach of applying scaling factors for each layer with constant unlearned values is a form of regularization, which is a common topic in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of batch normalization and warm-restart learning-rate schedules, which are techniques commonly used in the data science (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
