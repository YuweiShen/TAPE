The proposed technique involves training a dilated network with distinct patch sizes, which is a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the drawbacks of empirical and imposed patch size selection, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of remote sensing data sets is related to graphics (cs.GR), and the proposed algorithm involves training a network to capture multicontext characteristics, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
