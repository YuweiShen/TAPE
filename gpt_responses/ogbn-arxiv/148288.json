It also presents theoretical convergence conditions and numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with unsupervised clustering, which is a common task in AI. The paper may also be relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category as it discusses the communication cost reduction by controlling the local epoch length and allowing partial client participation. Furthermore, the paper may be relevant to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category as it deals with training a model over a network without knowing the client's private raw data. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category as it discusses the convergence rate of the proposed algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
