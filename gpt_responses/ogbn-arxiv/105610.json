The use of forgetting factors is a well-known heuristic in recursive least-squares algorithms, which are commonly used in signal processing and control theory. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the effect of forgetting factors on a class of online Newton algorithms, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the fields of optimization and control. The paper also proposes a novel gradient descent step size rule for strongly convex functions, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the field of optimization. Overall, the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning, optimization, and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
