The paper proposes a method that utilizes orthographic features to improve the performance of existing embedding-based methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is focused on NLP. \n\nThe paper also proposes methods that can learn and utilize orthographic correspondences even between languages with different scripts. This involves techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a likely sub-category as well. \n\nThe paper also involves experimentation and evaluation of the proposed method, which suggests that cs.LG (Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves cross-lingual analysis, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
