The use of selective relaying and the analysis of outage probability suggest that the paper belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The consideration of multiple interferers and the use of closed-form expressions and asymptotic analysis suggest that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of numerical simulations to validate the analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
