It also involves graphics (GR) techniques for rendering and relighting the shapes. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for material classification suggests a possible connection to multimedia (MM) and machine learning (LG) sub-categories. Finally, the overall approach involves a combination of data-driven and algorithmic techniques, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
