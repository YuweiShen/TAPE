The paper discusses heuristic state-space search, which is a common approach to optimal planning. The paper also presents a novel method for combining admissible heuristics for optimal planning, which involves active online learning. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
