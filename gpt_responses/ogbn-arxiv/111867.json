The use of deep learning frameworks and off-the-shelf detection networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The incorporation of geometric constraints and perspective layers in the 3D perspective network (3DPN) indicates that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of the BoxCars dataset and the evaluation of the approach on vehicle classification and verification tasks suggest that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
