This involves optimizing the beamformers and power allocation ratio to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel two-phase protocol for wireless-powered relay systems that enables self-energy recycling at the relay. This involves the relay operating in a full-duplex mode to achieve simultaneous wireless power and information transmission. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on secure transmission in wireless-powered relay systems with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information. The proposed protocol is designed to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate and offers a higher level of security compared to existing protocols. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel protocol for wireless-powered relay systems that involves optimizing the beamformers and power allocation ratio to achieve efficient energy transfer and information relaying. This requires a control system to manage the relay's operation in full-duplex mode. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a novel protocol for wireless-powered relay systems that enables self-energy recycling at the relay. This involves harvesting and reusing the loopback interference generated by the full-duplex operation for information relaying, which could be considered a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
