The paper specifically addresses the issue of word order divergence in multilingual NMT for extremely low resource languages. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also proposes a pre-ordering technique to bridge the word order gap, which involves training the parent model on the assisting language. This technique involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, making cs.AI another likely sub-category. The paper also evaluates the translation quality, which is a typical task in Machine Learning (ML) and falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Learning). Additionally, the paper uses experiments to evaluate the proposed technique, which involves the use of Neural Networks (NN) and falls under the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with language translation, which is a typical task in Computer Vision (CV) and falls under the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
