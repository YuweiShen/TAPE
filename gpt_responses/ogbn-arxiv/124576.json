The use of dependency syntax for feature selection is a common technique in NLP, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of support vector machines and class association rules for classification suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of morphological feature selection criteria, which is a common technique in Arabic NLP, suggesting that the paper could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
