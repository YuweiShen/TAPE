The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of predictive models and optimization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the robotic system, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
