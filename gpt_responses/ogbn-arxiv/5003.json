Specifically, the paper proposes a novel approach to enrich the embedding by disentangling parts-of-speech (PoS) in the accompanying captions, which is a technique commonly used in NLP. Therefore, cs.CL and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves multi-modal learning, which is a topic in multimedia (MM) research. The paper also uses retrieval techniques, which are commonly studied in information retrieval (IR) research. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for learning specialised embedding spaces, which is a topic in machine learning (LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
