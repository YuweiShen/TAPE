These tasks involve interactive navigation problems, which are typically addressed in the fields of robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY). The use of reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques to train the module suggests that it belongs to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
