The paper proposes a novel technique to avoid negative transfer, which is a common problem in transfer learning. The paper also evaluates the proposed technique on state-of-the-art deep transfer methods using benchmark datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
