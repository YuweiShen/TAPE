The paper also discusses the achievable rate of the proposed scheme, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and communication systems (cs.COMM). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) as it deals with the transmission of signals in a network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
