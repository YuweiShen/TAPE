The paper also performs comprehensive experiments for both identification and verification scenarios on two public datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the security aspect of palmprint recognition, indicating the possibility of being classified under cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a binary hash table structure for efficient matching, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
