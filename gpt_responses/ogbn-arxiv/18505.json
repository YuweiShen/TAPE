The use of differential privacy is a well-established technique for this purpose, and the paper proposes a new approach for tracking and saving the privacy cost associated with answering multiple queries on the same dataset. This involves designing an algorithm for reusing previous noisy responses, which requires a good understanding of the statistical properties of the data and the noise added to it. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of cryptography (cs.CR), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures (cs.DS), and cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
