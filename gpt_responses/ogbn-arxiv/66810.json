It may also belong to Robotics (cs.RO) as pedestrian detection is an important task for autonomous robots. Additionally, the use of synthetic human-agents for training may fall under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the concept of Spawn Probability Map may be related to Graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
