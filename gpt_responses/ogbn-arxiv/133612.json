The paper proposes a new algorithm that improves upon the previous best-known result by Kuhn [SODA '20]. The problem is related to distributed computing (cs.DC), distributed systems (cs.DS), algorithms (cs.AL), network protocols (cs.NI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
