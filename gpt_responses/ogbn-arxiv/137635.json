The paper also presents a combinatorial characterization of extreme points of the feasible set of the mathematical program, which involves algorithmic techniques. \n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the $c$-Balanced Separator problem, which involves partitioning a graph into two parts. This problem can be viewed as a geometric problem in which one aims to find a cut that separates two parts of a graph. The paper also presents a combinatorial characterization of extreme points of the feasible set of the mathematical program, which involves geometric arguments. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper proposes a new family of mathematical programs for the $c$-Balanced Separator problem, which is a graph partitioning problem.
