This falls under the scope of logic in computer science. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of SuSLik, a program synthesizer for SSL. This falls under the scope of software engineering. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper describes a deductive approach to synthesizing imperative programs from declarative specifications, which involves reasoning about formal languages and automata theory. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper focuses on synthesizing programs that manipulate heap-based linked data structures, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
