The paper also focuses on the use of degree information in these algorithms, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and graph theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper discusses approximation guarantees, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of computational geometry (cs.CG) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
