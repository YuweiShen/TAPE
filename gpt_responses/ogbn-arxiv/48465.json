Additionally, the paper discusses the use of ReLU layers in computer vision tasks (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces new tools for analyzing neural networks, which could potentially fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
