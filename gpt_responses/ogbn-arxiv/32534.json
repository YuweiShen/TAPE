Additionally, the paper mentions the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of linear classifiers and convex loss minimization, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nFurthermore, the paper mentions the use of global feature functions, which can be considered as a form of neural networks, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods on several image datasets, which suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
