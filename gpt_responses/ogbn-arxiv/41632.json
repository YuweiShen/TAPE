This makes cs.GR the most likely sub-category.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper mentions the need for solid software engineering in computer graphics, and Taichi is described as a high-performance infrastructure. These aspects suggest a focus on mathematical software development.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the development of an infrastructure that is portable, extensible, and reusable, which are important aspects of systems and control.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the development of a library, which involves programming language design and implementation.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper mentions the need for solid software engineering in computer graphics, which suggests a focus on software engineering practices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
