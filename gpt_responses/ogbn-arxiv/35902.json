The use of diffusion-based process for calculating user similarity is a technique commonly used in machine learning and deep learning (cs.DL), and the integration of two kinds of similarities is a form of ensemble learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also discusses metrics such as ranking score, Recall and Precision, which are commonly used in information retrieval and machine learning evaluation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
