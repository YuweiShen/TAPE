This makes the paper most likely to belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of SPOILER to improve cache attacks and Rowhammer attacks, which could also place it in the cs.AR (Architecture) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-categories.
