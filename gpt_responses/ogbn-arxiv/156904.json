This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves transfer learning and end-to-end training, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves feature extraction and classification, which are common techniques in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
