The paper proposes a reduced complexity sequential decoding algorithm for polar subcodes, which can also be used for decoding polar codes with CRC and short extended BCH codes. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communication and Networking (cs.CC) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed algorithm involves decomposing the polar subcode into outer codes and constructing codewords in descending order of probability, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with decoding algorithms for communication systems, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
