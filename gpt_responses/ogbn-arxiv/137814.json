This involves training a selective autoencoder to identify and extract features from unstable flame frames. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV) as the paper deals with image analysis. The paper also involves training a deep learning model, which suggests that it could belong to sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper deals with combustion processes, which could fall under the sub-category of scientific computing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
