This is a classic problem in game theory and mechanism design, which falls under the category of computational social choice (cs.SI). The paper proposes a market-based approach to this problem, which involves assigning prices to different alternatives and allowing agents to trade using artificial currency. This approach is related to the field of algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) and computational economics (cs.EC). The paper also discusses the use of randomized outcomes, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a novel technique called \"pairwise issue expansion\", which involves expanding each issue into many goods, and shows that this technique can be used to transform any public decision-making instance into an equivalent Fisher market. This technique is related to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
