Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. The paper also involves network infrastructure and communication protocols, which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as another likely category. The presence of malicious receivers and the need for security also suggest cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as a possible category. The use of mmWave transmission and UAVs suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as additional possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
