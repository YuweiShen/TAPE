The paper proposes a novel approach for complex question answering over knowledge graphs using unsupervised message passing, which involves natural language processing, graph traversal, and aggregation. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), databases (cs.DB), computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
