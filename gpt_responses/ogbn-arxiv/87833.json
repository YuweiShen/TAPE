The framework involves joint training of feature extraction and tracking process, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach also handles scale changes efficiently, which is a common problem in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
