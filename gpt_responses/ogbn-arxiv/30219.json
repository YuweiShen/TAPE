The paper specifically focuses on techniques for creating persistent and unforgeable watermarks, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications that rely on deep learning models. Additionally, the paper proposes new training techniques and introduces a new primitive, which could be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and optimization (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
