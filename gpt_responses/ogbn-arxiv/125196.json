Therefore, cs.AR (Computer Architecture) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses optimization techniques for efficient mapping of BNNs to hardware, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on classification accuracy and throughput, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
