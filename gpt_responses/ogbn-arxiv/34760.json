It also involves machine learning techniques such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and kernel methods, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed methods on image retrieval benchmarks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
