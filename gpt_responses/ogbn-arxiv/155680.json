The use of semantic segmentation information and loss functions also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The application of the system to driving scenarios implies a connection to robotics (cs.RO), and the concern with false alarms and accuracy suggests a focus on security and privacy (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
