The focus on backpropagation and optimization suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The discussion of semantics and representations also suggests relevance to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The examples taken from the literature, which include computer vision and natural language processing tasks, suggest relevance to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
