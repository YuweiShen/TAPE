The paper proposes a systematic approach to sample code mixed documents using a polyglot embedding based method. This falls under the scope of natural language processing, which is a subfield of cs.CL.\n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of code mixed documents in the context of the 2019 India-Pakistan conflict triggered by the Pulwama terror attack. The proposed pipeline holds promise in substantially reducing web moderation efforts. This falls under the scope of social and information networks, which is a subfield of cs.SI.\n\n3. cs.SD (Sound): Although the paper does not deal with sound, the proposed approach of using polyglot embeddings can be extended to speech processing tasks, such as speech recognition and speaker identification. This falls under the scope of sound, which is a subfield of cs.SD.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential utility of code mixed documents in making content partially accessible to a wider audience. This has implications for social inclusion and digital divide, which falls under the scope of computers and society, which is a subfield of cs.CY.\n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning):"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
