The paper also presents algorithms for computing these parameters, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The study of hyperbolicity is closely related to graph theory (cs.GT), as the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space can be reduced to the hyperbolicity of a graph. Finally, the paper discusses the algorithmic implications of their results in the field of large-scale network analysis, which is a topic in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
