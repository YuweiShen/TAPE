The system uses computer vision techniques to predict poses of humans and robots from a single image (cs.CV). The goal of the system is to coordinate human-machine interactions, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The system also uses predefined virtual sensors, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the system merges pose information to a metric 3D space, which could involve machine learning algorithms for regression or classification (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
