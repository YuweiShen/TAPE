The problems studied in the paper involve deleting edges and vertices, which are common operations in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses parameterized complexity techniques to analyze the computational complexity of the problems, which is a subfield of computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
