It also addresses the weakness of previous CCA methods in discriminative tasks such as multi-view learning. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as multi-view learning is a common problem in computer vision, and the paper shows significant improvement in cross-view classification. \n\nAdditionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the proposed method involves optimizing a task objective in addition to the CCA projection. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) as CCA is widely used for multimodal data analysis, which is a common problem in multimedia. \n\nFinally, it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the proposed method involves learning a non-linear CCA projection in an end-to-end manner, which is a common approach in neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
