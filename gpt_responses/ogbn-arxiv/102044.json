The problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or more generally to any two-sided market. The paper introduces a new variant of the stable marriage problem with quantitative preferences, where each man and woman provides a score for each member of the opposite sex. This variant is more expressive than the classical stable marriage problem and has applications in modeling profits or costs. Therefore, the paper is likely to be classified under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with a well-known problem in game theory, and introduces a new variant of the problem with quantitative preferences. \n\n2. cs.AI (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes algorithms to find stable and optimal marriages according to new notions of stability and optimality. \n\n3. cs.DS (Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms to solve the stable marriage problem with quantitative preferences. \n\n4. cs.SI (Computer Science and Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a problem of matching individuals in a two-sided market, which is a common problem in social and information networks. \n\n5. cs.LG (Computer Science and Learning): The paper introduces a new variant"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
