The paper deals with unsupervised selection of justification sentences for multi-hop question answering, which involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach that improves the performance of a state-of-the-art supervised QA model, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
