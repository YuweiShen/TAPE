This topic falls under the category of computer networks and communications (cs.NI). The proposed solution involves the use of machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and stacked autoencoder, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses security issues related to NFV, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of NFV over multiple clouds also involves distributed computing, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the proposed solution involves the management of complex systems, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
