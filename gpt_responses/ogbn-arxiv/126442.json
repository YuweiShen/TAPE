The use of enzymes for ISI mitigation involves the study of system environment parameters, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the deployment of enzymes at particular locations, which involves the study of molecular machines (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the application of molecular communication in biological systems, which falls under the category of bioinformatics (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
