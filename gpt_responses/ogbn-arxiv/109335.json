The use of LDPC codes is a common technique in coding theory and communications, which suggests the paper could also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and computer communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed codes in terms of bit error rate, which is a common metric in the coding and communications literature, suggesting the paper could also be relevant to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
