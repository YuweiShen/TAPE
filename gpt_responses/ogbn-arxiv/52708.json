This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves unsupervised and weakly supervised learning, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of clustering, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
