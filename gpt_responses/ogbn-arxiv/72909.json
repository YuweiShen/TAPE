The use of a multi-branch network and recurrent approach involves a significant amount of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also discusses the use of improved components to handle different degradation factors, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
