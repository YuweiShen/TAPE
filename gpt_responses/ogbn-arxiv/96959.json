The paper also touches upon the security implications of aggregation, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the trade-offs involved in aggregation, which can be seen as a system-level optimization problem (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of aggregation in multimedia applications, which can be related to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
