The paper uses machine learning techniques to represent logical operators as learned geometric operations in a low-dimensional embedding space. This work involves the intersection of several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), databases (cs.DB), machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
