The paper also mentions that the results are applicable to economic experiments, which are often modeled using game theory. \n2. cs.LG (Learning): The paper deals with active learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. The paper also proposes learning algorithms for the two economic problems mentioned, which falls under the purview of cs.LG. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes learning algorithms for two economic problems, which can be seen as applications of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): The paper deals with incentive compatibility in economic experiments, which is a topic that falls under the intersection of economics and computation. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes learning algorithms for the two economic problems mentioned, which can be seen as algorithms for processing data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
