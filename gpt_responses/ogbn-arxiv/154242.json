This involves incorporating the subset cardinality as an additional learning dimension to guide the search process. The approach is evaluated using two induction algorithms and the robustness of the selected feature subsets is investigated. This work involves machine learning, optimization, and signal processing techniques, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, cs.SI, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
