The focus on neuroscience papers being retracted due to programmer error suggests that the paper may be most relevant to the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE). However, the guidelines presented are general enough to be applicable to other sub-fields such as machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
