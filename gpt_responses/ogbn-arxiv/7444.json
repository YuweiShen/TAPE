The paper also presents algorithms for constructing a partial order representing all strongly stable matchings, which involves computational aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the distributive lattice structure of strongly stable matchings, which is a topic in the field of social choice theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
