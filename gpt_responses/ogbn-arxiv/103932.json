The paper also discusses agent preferences, which is a common topic in AI. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses algorithms for finding fair allocations, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses fairness notions, which is a common topic in machine learning. The paper also discusses algorithms for finding fair allocations, which can be seen as a type of optimization problem, which is a common topic in machine learning. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the problem of allocating items among different agents, which is a common topic in social networks.
