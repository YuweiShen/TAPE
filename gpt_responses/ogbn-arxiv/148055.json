Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the design and analysis of algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper mentions linear objective functions, which could indicate a connection to optimization problems, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves geometric algorithms with theoretical guarantees, which could suggest a connection to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
