This suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.DL (Digital Libraries) sub-categories. However, the paper also discusses theoretical properties and implementation techniques, which are more closely related to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions improved practical performance, which could be related to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS, cs.IR, cs.CC, cs.DL, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
