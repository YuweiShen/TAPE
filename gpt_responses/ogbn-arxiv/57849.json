The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel approach to extract and apply spectral-spatial features, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of dropout and weight sharing techniques suggests that it could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with hyperspectral image classification, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
