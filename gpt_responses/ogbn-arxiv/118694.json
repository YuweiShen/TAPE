The focus of the paper is on building compute-efficient models, which involves techniques such as distillation and reducing the number of floating point operations (FLOPs), which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions cluster-and-aggregate models, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
