The use of LDPC codes in wireless networks also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system integration (cs.SI). Additionally, the proposed variable node matched mapping (VNMM) scheme and hierarchical extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) algorithm may involve data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
