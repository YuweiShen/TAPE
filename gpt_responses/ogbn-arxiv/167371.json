Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security protocols, which could place it in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper evaluates performance, which could place it in cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents APIs and functions, which could place it in cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
