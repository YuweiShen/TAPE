Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and secrecy capacity are used in the analysis. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with video streaming in cache-enabled small cell networks, which is a networking problem. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a scheme for video streaming using scalable video coding (SVC) and exploits the cache memory of all BSs for improving system performance. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the issue of untrusted cache helpers in small cell networks and proposes a scheme for secure video streaming. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with small cell networks, which are a type of wireless network, and proposes a scheme for improving system performance by exploiting the cache memory of all BSs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
