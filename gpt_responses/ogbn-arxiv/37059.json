The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning and estimation, which falls under artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper addresses occlusion, which is a common problem in robotics (RO) and computer vision (CV) fields. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.GR, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
