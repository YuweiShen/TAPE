It also discusses the tradeoff between robustness under different norms, which is a common topic in machine learning research. Additionally, the paper uses tools from the manifold reconstruction literature, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n\nThe paper also discusses adversarial examples in the context of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as these fields often deal with image classification and decision-making tasks. \n\nFurthermore, the paper touches on the topic of security and cryptography (cs.CR) as adversarial examples can be used to attack machine learning models and compromise their security. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the efficiency of adversarial training, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
