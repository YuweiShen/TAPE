Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves training sequence-to-sequence models, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of large datasets and evaluation of performance using automatic scores and human ratings suggests the sub-category cs.LG (Learning). The paper also involves generating plausible explanations, which can be related to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves information retrieval techniques to collect large datasets, which can be related to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
