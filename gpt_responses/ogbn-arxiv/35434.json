The paper proposes a novel approach that involves training the pipeline end-to-end using back-propagation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of uncertainty estimates, which is a topic related to natural language processing (cs.CL).
