The use of defining sets and the absolute trace function suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and algebraic coding theory, which are also relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The applications of the codes in association schemes and secret sharing schemes suggest a connection to cryptography (cs.CR) and security and privacy (cs.SI). Overall, cs.IT and cs.CR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.DM, cs.CC, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
