This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper deals with voltage stability assessment in power systems, which is a core topic in power and energy. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a new index for voltage stability assessment, which can be considered as an emerging technology in the field of power systems. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that the proposed index is computationally inexpensive, which could be of interest to researchers working on distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves the development of a computational model for voltage stability assessment, which falls under the domain of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
