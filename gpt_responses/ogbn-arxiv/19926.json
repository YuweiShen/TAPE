It also involves training a gating network to map inputs to a distribution over experts, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the model involves training multiple sets of experts, which could be seen as a form of neural network architecture. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible category as the paper proposes a new approach to building larger networks that are still cheap to compute at test time, which is a common goal in AI research. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also possible categories as the paper applies the model to image and speech datasets, respectively. However, these categories are less likely as the paper focuses more on the model architecture than on specific applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
