The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is derived based on nested lattice codes, which is a common technique used in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new communication strategy for MIMO TWRCs, which is a type of wireless network architecture. The proposed scheme involves physical-layer network coding, which is a technique used in wireless networks to improve network throughput. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new communication strategy that involves the design of a precoding matrix to align the eigen-directions of the two-user's MIMO channels. This involves the use of control theory techniques to optimize the performance of the communication system. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed communication strategy involves the use of multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) channels, which are commonly used in multimedia applications to improve the quality of video and audio transmission. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves the use of mathematical techniques, such as nested lattice codes and eigen-direction alignment, to design and optimize the proposed communication strategy.
