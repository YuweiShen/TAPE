The paper specifically focuses on hyperparameters, which are critical in machine learning algorithms, and can be stolen using the proposed attacks. Therefore, the paper is also likely to be classified under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
