The use of inertial measurement units (IMU), motion capture, and GPS also suggests that it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The development of algorithms for event-based cameras may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
