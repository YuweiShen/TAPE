The use of evolutionary algorithms and coevolution also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The study of partially observable games involves the use of probabilistic models and decision-making under uncertainty, which is relevant to systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of stochastic optimization methods falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
