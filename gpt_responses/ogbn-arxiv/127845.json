The paper also discusses the presence of Byzantine failures, which is a security-related issue, and hence the paper could also be categorized under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The paper involves communication complexity, which is a topic that falls under Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves algorithms and data structures, which is a topic that falls under Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS).
