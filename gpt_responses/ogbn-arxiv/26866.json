The paper also discusses the protocol and mechanisms required for this integration, which could fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The scalability and dynamic management of the network topology could also be relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The integration of ICN and SDN could also involve system-level design and control, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
