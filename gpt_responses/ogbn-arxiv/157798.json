The paper also discusses probabilistic automata, which falls under the probabilistic methods (cs.PL) sub-category. The use of fixed-point equations and parity games suggests a connection to the theory of computation (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on coalgebraic modeling suggests a connection to the category theory (cs.LT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
