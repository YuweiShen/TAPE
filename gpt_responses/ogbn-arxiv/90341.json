The paper proposes a two-stage learning framework for property derivation and fusion, which involves deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Therefore, the paper is also likely to be relevant to sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
