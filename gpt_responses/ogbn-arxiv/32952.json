The paper also discusses the role of prior assumptions in the success of CNNs, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses gradient descent, which is a common optimization technique in neural networks and falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
