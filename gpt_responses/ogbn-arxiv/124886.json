This involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for object detection and classification, as well as robotics (cs.RO) for the use of sensor fusion and machine learning in an automated vehicle context. The paper also discusses design considerations and ablation studies, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the models on the KITTI Bird's Eye View benchmark involves systems and control (cs.SY) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
