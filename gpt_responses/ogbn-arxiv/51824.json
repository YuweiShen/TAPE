The use of dialgebras, which generalise both algebras and coalgebras, is a novel approach that could be of interest to researchers in Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Language Theory (cs.LT). The paper also discusses the inter-definition of categories of dialgebras, which could be relevant to researchers in Software Engineering (cs.SE) who are interested in formal methods. Finally, the paper presents a comparison between the standard coalgebraic semantics and its dialgebraic counterpart, which is a theoretical result that could be of interest to researchers in Theory of Computation (cs.THEORY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
