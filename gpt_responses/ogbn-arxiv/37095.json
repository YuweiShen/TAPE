Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a simple yet effective algorithm for outlier detection and robust QoE evaluation, which involves iterative optimization and binary weights, indicating the use of machine learning and optimization techniques. Hence, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories. The paper also mentions the use of simulated examples and real-world applications, indicating the use of data analysis techniques, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision) a likely category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of iterative optimization, which is a common technique in information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
