Therefore, it is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it deals with the simulation of 5G networks and their performance. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory) as it considers the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) mapping and SINR-block error rate (BLER) lookup tables for various NR configurations. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it presents a system-level simulator for 5G NR networks. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia) as it deals with the modulation and coding schemes used in 5G NR networks. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) as it may involve the hardware architecture of 5G NR networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
