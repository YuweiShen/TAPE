The proposed model involves the aggregation of multiple convolutional layers, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The model also involves the use of multi-scale contextual information, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of pre-trained models and cross-center evaluation suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) and medical imaging (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
