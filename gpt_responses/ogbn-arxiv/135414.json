The paper specifically focuses on the use of gradient normalization to balance training across multiple tasks, which is a key challenge in multitask learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper mentions regression and classification tasks, which are common in neural networks, suggesting that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions natural language processing as a potential application of multitask learning, indicating that cs.CL (Computation and Language) is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
