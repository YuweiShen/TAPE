The study also analyzes the different organizational layers where KM practices are implemented, which involves aspects of cybernetics (cs.CY). The use of social interaction to share tacit knowledge suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the promotion of knowledge transfer processes and the potential loss of knowledge due to informal communication relate to social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
