These problems are related to graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and computational geometry, which are all subfields of computer science. The paper also mentions dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer strategies, and sparse instance decompositions, which are common techniques in algorithm design and analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
