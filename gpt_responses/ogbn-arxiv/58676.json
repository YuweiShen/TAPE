The paper also introduces a coalitional game for base station clustering, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT). The paper proposes a distributed coalition formation algorithm, which involves system-level optimization and control, and thus can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes numerical simulations, which can be related to multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the processing and analysis of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
