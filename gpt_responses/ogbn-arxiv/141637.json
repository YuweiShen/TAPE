The paper proposes a new calculus and constraint propagation procedure for solving cCOA-CSPs (cCOA Constraint Satisfaction Problems), which involves combining two well-known calculi in QSR: Frank's cardinal direction calculus (CDA) and a coarser version of Freksa's relative orientation calculus (ROA). This paper also discusses the importance of taking into account the interaction between the two combined calculi. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
