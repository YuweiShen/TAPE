Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves partial differential equations and numerical methods, which suggest that it could belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of functions to extract features could also place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the focus on shape features and skeleton extraction could suggest cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
