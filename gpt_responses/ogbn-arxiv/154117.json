The paper focuses on the use of natural language processing techniques to extract medical entities from doctor notes and uses them to assess the level of medical urgency. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques to develop the patient triage system, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of a method to detect warning symptoms, which makes cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) other possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
