The proposed method aims to efficiently simulate temperature evolution of transmission systems under multiple operation states, which can be considered as a control problem. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes an efficient simulation method for temperature evolution of transmission systems, which involves numerical methods and computational efforts. The method can be applied to assess the over-temperature risk in both the planning stage and real-time operations, which is relevant to computational engineering and science. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to construct the region of over-temperature in the environmental parameter space, which can be considered as a data-driven approach. The method can be used for risk assessment and decision support, which are relevant to artificial intelligence. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a new method for simulating temperature evolution of transmission systems, which can be considered as an emerging technology in the field of power systems. The method is based on an approximate analytical solution and numerical weather prediction data, which can be used for online risk assessment and decision support. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes an efficient simulation method for temperature evolution of transmission systems, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
