The paper also proposes a new method for compressing CNNs, which involves using fixed filters and one-dimensional filters, which could be considered a form of neural architecture search (cs.AI) or optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper applies the method to four well-known network architectures, which could be considered a form of experimental evaluation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
