The use of Semi Adversarial Networks (SAN) is a technique for perturbing face images, which is related to adversarial attacks and defense (cs.CR). The paper proposes an ensemble model that generates diverse perturbed outputs, which is a technique for improving the performance of machine learning models (cs.LG). The experiments involve face matchers, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of SANs for privacy is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
