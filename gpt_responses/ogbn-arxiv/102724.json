This falls under the category of data structures and algorithms, which is covered by cs.DS. The paper also mentions the use of algorithms and tools for processing graphs, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of software packages and dependencies suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of graphs for modeling and analysis in various fields, such as construction, also suggests a connection to social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of modeling and representation of data suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
