The proposed approach uses a deep neural network with recurrent layers, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments are conducted on a dataset of still images, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
