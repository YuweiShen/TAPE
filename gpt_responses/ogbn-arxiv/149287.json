This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the comparison of human perception to state-of-the-art object detectors, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Additionally, the paper touches on the theory of part-based object representation in the brain, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
