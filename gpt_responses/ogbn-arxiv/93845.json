This involves designing a novel priority-based abstraction and implementing it as a language and compiler extension to GraphIt. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Programming Languages (cs.PL), Performance (cs.PF), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
