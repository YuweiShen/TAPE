The proposed method involves learning semantic and shape biased representations, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the use of jigsaw puzzles for autonomous exploration suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
