This topic falls under the broad category of machine learning and specifically, deep learning. The paper proposes modifications to improve the performance of attention-based GNNs, which is a sub-topic of GNNs. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
