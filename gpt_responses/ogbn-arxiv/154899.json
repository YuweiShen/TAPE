The paper also discusses the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT), which is a fundamental concept in wireless communication systems and falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy, which is a common technique in wireless communication and falls under the Communications (cs.COMM) sub-category.
