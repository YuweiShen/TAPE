The use of large-scale MIMO and multi-carrier waveforms also suggests that the paper may fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the development of low-complexity data detection algorithms for these waveforms may also make the paper relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
