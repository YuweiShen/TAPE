Additionally, the use of geographical descriptors and referring expression generation suggests a focus on language understanding and generation. The paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories due to the use of human subjects and the potential for developing models to improve language grounding. Computer Vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant due to the graphical representations of the geographical descriptors. Finally, Information Retrieval (cs.IR) may be relevant as the paper presents a data resource that could be used for information retrieval tasks related to geographical locations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
