The use of probabilistic models also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on planning and decision-making under uncertainty suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the mention of potential actions and tradeoffs suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
