The use of MIMO precoder designs and MMSE-SIC receivers suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new protocol and compares it to conventional baselines, indicating a potential fit for computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
