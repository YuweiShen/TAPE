The paper also mentions the use of coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) modulation, which is a technique commonly used in optical communication systems (cs.COMM). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of polarization diversity coherent receivers, which is a topic related to optics and photonics (cs.PHOTONICS). Finally, the paper discusses the transmission of signals over long distances, which is a topic related to optical networking and high-speed communication (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
