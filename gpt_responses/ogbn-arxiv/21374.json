The paper focuses on three forms of responses to these preprints: downloads on the arXiv.org site, mentions on Twitter, and early citations in the scholarly record. Given this focus, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which includes research on social media and online communities.
