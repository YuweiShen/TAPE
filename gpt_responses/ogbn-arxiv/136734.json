The paper also discusses the use of swarm coordination algorithms, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of sensors for detecting objects of interest suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the use of biologically-inspired mechanisms for coordination suggests multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
