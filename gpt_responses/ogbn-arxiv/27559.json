The use of approximate computing and multiobjective optimization algorithms also suggests a connection to computer architecture (cs.AR) and control systems (cs.SY). The proposed approach involves the selection of suitable approximate multipliers, which can be seen as a problem in electronic design automation (cs.ET) and the optimization of energy consumption, which is related to energy management (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
