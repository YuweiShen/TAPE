This falls under the area of distributed computing (cs.DC) and networked systems (cs.NI). The use of sparse linear sketches is a technique from data structures (cs.DS) and the paper also discusses the complexity of the communication in terms of bits, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Overall, the paper covers a range of topics that could fit into multiple sub-categories, but the focus on distributed computing and networked systems makes cs.DC and cs.NI the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
