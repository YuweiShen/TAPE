This involves developing a theoretical framework for an empathic autonomous agent that considers the utility functions of other agents and compares them with its own preferences using a system of shared values to find a solution that all agents consider acceptable. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), robotics (cs.RO), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
