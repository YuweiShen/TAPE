The proposed method also involves the use of attention mechanism and graph convolutional LSTM network, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques for video analysis (cs.MM) and the optimization of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
