The use of permutations also involves information theory (cs.IT) and combinatorics (cs.CC). The paper also presents a relationship between the number of permutations used and the improvement of performance, which can be seen as a computational problem and falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the potential application of the method for increasing cryptographic strength suggests a connection to system and network security (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
