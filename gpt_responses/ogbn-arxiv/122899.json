Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves networked systems and communication protocols, which fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of numerical evaluations and optimization techniques suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
