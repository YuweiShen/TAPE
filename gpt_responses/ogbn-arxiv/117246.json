The paper also discusses the issue of privacy in the context of differential privacy (cs.CR) and proposes a family of simple models for approximating complex models (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image benchmark datasets (cs.CV) and a medical dataset (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
