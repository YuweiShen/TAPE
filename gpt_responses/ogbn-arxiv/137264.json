The paper also discusses the properties of graphs and their connectivity, which are topics of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper uses techniques from computational geometry (cs.CG) to construct planar graphs with certain properties."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
