The use of machine learning techniques such as SVM-KNN, Local Ensemble Kernel Learning, and Multiple Kernel Learning suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of descriptors and histograms suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
