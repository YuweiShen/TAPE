The paper proposes a new framework for constructing space partitions based on supervised classification, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses the KaHIP graph partitioner, which is a tool for graph partitioning (cs.DS) and has been used in previous work on nearest neighbor search. Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on several standard benchmarks for NNS, which are likely to fall under computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
