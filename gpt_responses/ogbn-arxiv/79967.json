The paper also discusses the use of image reconstruction loss and geometric consistency loss, which are common techniques in computer vision. Additionally, the paper uses the KITTI driving dataset, which is a popular dataset in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as it deals with ego-motion estimation, which is relevant to robotics and autonomous navigation. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a jointly unsupervised learning framework for multiple tasks. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a framework for scene understanding, which is a common task in AI research. \n\nFinally, the paper may be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with 3D scene geometry and image reconstruction, which are relevant to computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
