The use of orthogonal polynomials also suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the detector, which is a common topic in machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses optimization techniques to find the optimal ROC profile, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
