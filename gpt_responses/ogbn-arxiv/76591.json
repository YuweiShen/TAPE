This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), machine learning (cs.LG), databases (cs.DB), and software engineering (cs.SE). Given the focus on constraint-based methods, cs.AI and cs.DM are the most likely categories. The use of specialized algorithms and experiments also suggests a focus on practical applications, which could place the paper in cs.DB or cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
