The method involves sampling from a dataset in a specific way, which is related to data augmentation techniques commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the benefits of the proposed method in terms of reducing overfitting, which is a common concern in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on image classification tasks, which is a common application of deep learning (cs.CV). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a longer period of initial large learning rate, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE) and machine learning in general (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
