This method is universal and works across application area boundaries, making it applicable to a wide range of fields. The paper also discusses the theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, which is related to Kolmogorov complexity. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
