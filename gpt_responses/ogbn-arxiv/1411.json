The problem of finding $k$ shortest paths and $k$ smallest spanning trees involves combinatorial optimization (cs.DM) techniques. The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques such as dynamic programming and branch-and-bound algorithms. The problem of finding $k$ best matchings in weighted graphs involves computational geometry (cs.CG) techniques such as geometric algorithms for matching problems.
