The paper proposes a novel gradient for training deep neural networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method is done on face recognition benchmarks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper emphasizes the efficiency and speed of the proposed method, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
