Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with the security and cryptography aspects of Bitcoin, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. Additionally, the use of AI and data science techniques could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories, respectively.
