The use of information-theoretic tools suggests that the paper may belong to the categories of cryptography (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). The characterization of complete primitives involves the study of communication channels, which is related to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG), as secure two-party computation is a key building block for privacy-preserving machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
