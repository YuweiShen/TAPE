The proposed approach involves using cascaded neural networks, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the issue of class imbalance, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach using FROC curves, which is a common evaluation metric in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
