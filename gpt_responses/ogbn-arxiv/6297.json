The use of optimal transport (OT) and the development of an end-to-end optimizer suggest that this paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of side information and the application of the method to single-cell RNA-seq data suggest that this paper may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
