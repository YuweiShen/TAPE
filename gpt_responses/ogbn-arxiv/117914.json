The paper also discusses the data representation used for different constraint types, which is relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the paper provides an extensive experimental analysis, which could be relevant to computer science theory (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
