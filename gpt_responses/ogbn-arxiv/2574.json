Additionally, the paper mentions the use of representative models such as ResNet-50, Transformer, and NCF, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.AI), and recommender systems (cs.DS) - all of which are sub-categories of Machine Learning. The paper also discusses the optimization of DNN tensors, which is a common topic in Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
