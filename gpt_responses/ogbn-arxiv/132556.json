It also involves networked systems and online algorithms (cs.NI), as well as data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) for efficient computation. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed mechanisms through simulations, which involves machine learning and statistical methods (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
