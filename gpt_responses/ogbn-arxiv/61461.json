This falls under the category of scientific computing and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep learning techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the proposed technique to physical systems suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). Finally, the use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for model reduction suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
