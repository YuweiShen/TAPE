This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically deep learning, which is a subfield of CS.LG.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper is not directly related to computer vision, the use of CNNs for feature extraction and classification is a common technique in computer vision. Therefore, this sub-category is also likely.\n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a neural network architecture for classification, which falls under the domain of neural computing. Therefore, this sub-category is also likely.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a machine learning technique for classification, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. Therefore, this sub-category is also likely.\n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): Although the paper is not directly related to human-computer interaction, the application of the proposed model is in the healthcare domain, which involves interaction between humans and computers.
