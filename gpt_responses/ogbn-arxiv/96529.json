This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n- cs.LG: The paper uses Gradient Boosting classification, which is a popular machine learning technique. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n- cs.SY: The paper deals with detecting anomalies in real-time drilling telemetry, which is a control system. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Systems and Control sub-category.\n- cs.CR: The paper deals with detecting and preventing accidents, which is a security concern. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category.\n- cs.SE: The paper deals with developing a model for detecting anomalies in real-time drilling telemetry, which is a software engineering problem.
