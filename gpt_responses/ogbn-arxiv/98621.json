The paper proposes a control strategy based on dynamic state feedback linearization, which is a common approach in robotics. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a control strategy for stabilizing the multi-rotor platform, which is a typical problem in systems and control. The paper rigorously proves the stability and convergence properties of the control law using Lyapunov-based methods, which is a common approach in systems and control. \n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a control strategy based on dynamic state feedback linearization, which involves computational methods. The paper also presents simulation results, which involve computational modeling and simulation. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with the control of a multi-rotor platform, which can be considered as a multi-agent system. The paper proposes a control strategy based on dynamic state feedback linearization, which is a common approach in multi-agent systems. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the proposed control strategy can be considered as a form of learning-based control, where the zero-moment direction is identified based"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
