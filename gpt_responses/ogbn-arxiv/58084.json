These topics are closely related to the field of network infrastructure (NI) and information theory (IT). The paper also discusses the management of multimedia (MM) data and the need for quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) in the target interface. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of security (CR) in the overlaying network. Finally, the paper proposes an interface selection mechanism that involves decision-making and control (SY) to optimize power consumption. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.MM, cs.CR, and cs.SY, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
