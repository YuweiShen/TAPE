The paper also involves algebraic structures and properties of rings, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper presents an encoding and decoding algorithm, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves the study of minimal spanning sets, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides examples of codes with good parameters, which is a topic in machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
