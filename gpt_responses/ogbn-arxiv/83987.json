The use of Bayesian Neural Networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the high-dimensionality and multi-modality of the posterior distribution, which suggests that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method for improving the efficiency of the sampler, which could also make it relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
