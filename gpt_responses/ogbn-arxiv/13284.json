The algorithm is also applied to control a real robotic helicopter (cs.RO). The approach involves calculating posterior distributions and evaluating expected rewards, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of macro-actions, which are a type of planning abstraction commonly used in automated planning (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
