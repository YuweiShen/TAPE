Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as it involves natural language processing and dialogue modeling. It also involves machine learning and data-driven approaches, which could fall under Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions characterizing differences between customer and agent behavior, which could fall under Cybersecurity (cs.CY) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories.
