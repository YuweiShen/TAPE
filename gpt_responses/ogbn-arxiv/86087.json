This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the computational hardness of finding optimal mixed equilibria, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of information theory to bound the principal's gain, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
