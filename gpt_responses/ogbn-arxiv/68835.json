The focus is on sparse graphs, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also introduces a novel notion of graph width, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
