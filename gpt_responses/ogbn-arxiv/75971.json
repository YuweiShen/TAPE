This involves the use of convolutional autoregressive models and variational autoencoders. The paper also discusses the use of the learned dynamics model and action prior for end-to-end, fully differentiable trajectory optimization and model-based policy optimization. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
