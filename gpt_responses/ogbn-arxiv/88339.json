The system is designed for deployment on autonomous agents such as robots and drones (cs.RO) and is optimized for energy efficiency (cs.SY). The system also involves neural networks (cs.NE) and hardware implementation, which further supports these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
