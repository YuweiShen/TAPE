The paper also discusses the impact of cognitive ability on the capacity region of the channel, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes a new achievable rate region, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE).
