This could be seen as a machine learning problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): Multi-view registration is also relevant to multimedia applications, such as 3D reconstruction. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly relate to social networks, but the concept of using weights to denote reliability could be applied in network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
