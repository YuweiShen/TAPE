It may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category as it involves processing and analyzing video data. Additionally, it could be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it introduces a new space-time person representation and a Time Shift Dynamic Time Warping (TS-DTW) model for data selection and matching. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) could also be a possible category as the paper deals with matching people across views. Finally, it could be categorized under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it addresses the scalability issue of ReID methods in real-world large scale camera networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
