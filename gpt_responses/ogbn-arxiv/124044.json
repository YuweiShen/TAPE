The paper discusses the use of resource partitioning techniques to address this challenge. Given the focus on security and isolation, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of thermal side channels, which could fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) or cs.OS (Operating Systems). The paper also discusses the limitations of isolation on multi-core systems, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
