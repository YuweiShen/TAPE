This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.DB (Databases) is the most likely category as the paper discusses similarity search in databases. \n\ncs.AR (Hardware Architecture) is also likely as the paper proposes an application-driven near-data processing accelerator for similarity search. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is another possible category as the paper mentions similarity search in computer vision. \n\ncs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is a possible category as the paper discusses the poor support for kNN on today's architectures due to high memory bandwidth requirements. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another possible category as the paper discusses the energy efficiency improvement of SSAM over multicore CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
