The use of membership oracles suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The optimization aspect suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of reductions suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
