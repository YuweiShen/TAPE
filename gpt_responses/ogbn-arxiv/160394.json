It also uses lattice theory and duality theory, which are topics in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.LO, cs.DS). The paper discusses the equational theory of these lattices, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents a combinatorial characterization of the dual spaces of lattices, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
