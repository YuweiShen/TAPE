This category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions social network communication data as an example of streaming graphs, indicating that it is relevant to this category.\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions financial transfer data as an example of streaming graphs, which is often stored in databases. Therefore, this category is also a likely fit.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the challenges posed by high volume and velocity streaming graphs, which can be seen as a control problem. Hence, this category is also a possible fit.\n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper mentions internet traffic data as an example of streaming graphs, indicating that it is relevant to this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
