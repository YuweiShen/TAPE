This optimization problem can be viewed as an information-theoretic problem, as it involves maximizing the amount of information that can be transmitted over the wireless channel subject to power and energy constraints. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design and optimization of a practical CoMP system with clustered multiple-antenna BSs cooperatively communicating with multiple single-antenna MTs, where each BS is equipped with local renewable energy generators to supply power and a smart meter to enable two-way energy flow with the grid. This involves addressing various networking and internet architecture issues, such as energy management, resource allocation, and communication protocols. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new energy cooperation paradigm, where a group of BSs dynamically shares their renewable energy for more efficient operation via locally injecting/drawing power to/from an aggregator with a zero effective sum energy exchanged. This involves designing and analyzing a control system that can regulate the energy flow among the BSs and the grid to ensure optimal performance. \n4. cs.GT (Computer"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
