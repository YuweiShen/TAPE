The primary focus is on incorporating the query term independence assumption into three state-of-the-art neural IR models: BERT, Duet, and CKNRM. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). However, since the paper deals with deep neural networks, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper evaluates the performance of these models on a passage ranking task, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
