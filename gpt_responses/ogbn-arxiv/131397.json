This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the classification tasks and the use of shallow CNNs, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new scheme to capture the nonlinearity of filter distribution, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed scheme in mobile applications, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
