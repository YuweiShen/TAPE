The proposed framework also integrates high-level semantic cues and contextual information, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of a shared foundation network and the emphasis on performance improvement indicate a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves image retrieval (cs.IR) techniques for nuclei detection and segmentation. Finally, the use of histopathology images suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
