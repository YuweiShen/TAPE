The paper proposes a systematic method for source detection that involves modeling generators as effective admittance matrices, which is a technique that is commonly used in power flow analysis (cs.PF) and circuit analysis (cs.CE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SY, cs.DS, cs.ET, cs.PF, and cs.CE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
