The paper discusses the limitations of the Peer-prediction mechanism and proposes a new mechanism that addresses these limitations. This falls under the category of algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) and machine learning (cs.AI), as well as potentially falling under the categories of learning theory (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
