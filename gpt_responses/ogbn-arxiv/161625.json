It also involves algebraic geometry codes, which is a subfield of theoretical computer science (cs.GT). The paper uses mathematical techniques such as order domains and generalized Hamming weights, which are also relevant to coding theory (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves some computational aspects, such as code constructions, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
