The use of polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses a weighted version of the problem, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
