The paper also experiments with text classification datasets, which is a common application of NLP. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories because it proposes a training method that improves model performance. \n\nThe use of random noises in the training process suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of text classification datasets and the potential application of the method to image classification suggests that it may also belong to the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
