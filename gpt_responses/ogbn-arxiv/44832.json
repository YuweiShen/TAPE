Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely categories. The paper also considers the abstraction of a geometric exploration of a space by a robot, which falls under cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The exploration policies discussed in the paper involve local greedy strategies, which are commonly used in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
