The paper proposes a new model for recommendation based on graph convolution network (GCN), which is a popular technique in both social network analysis (cs.SI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also compares its proposed model with existing GCN-based recommender models, which is a common task in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
