Additionally, the paper discusses the design space for input methods, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) to extract abstract features for input methods and a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the input methods, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
