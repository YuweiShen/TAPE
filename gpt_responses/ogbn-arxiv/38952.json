The paper specifically focuses on the comparison of field-normalized citation scores between Microsoft Academic and Web of Science. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), databases (cs.DB), cryptography (cs.CR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). However, given the emphasis on bibliometrics and citation analysis, we believe that cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.DB, cs.CR, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
