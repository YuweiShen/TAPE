The method presented involves approximating bit-channels, which is a common technique in source coding (cs.SI). The iterative upgrading of the bit-channels is a computational process, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves analyzing the performance of the constructed codes, which can be considered a data analysis task (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with optimizing the construction of polar codes, which can be considered a machine learning task (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
