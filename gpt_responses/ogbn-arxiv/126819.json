The paper also introduces a new mechanism for temporal windows, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of set operations and their computation, which could be relevant to researchers in cryptography (cs.CR) who are interested in secure set operations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
