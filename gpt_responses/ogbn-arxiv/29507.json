This fits well within the scope of logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper is about a programming language for quantum computation, and presents a translation from that language to another tool. This makes cs.PL a likely category.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): Quantum computing is an emerging technology, and the paper is about a programming language and a model checker for quantum computation. This makes cs.ET a possible category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper involves testing and verification of quantum programs, which is a software engineering task. This makes cs.SE a possible category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper is about a programming language for quantum computation, and presents a translation from that language to another tool.
