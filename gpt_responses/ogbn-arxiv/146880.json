This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.SD), social and economic systems (cs.SOC), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, given the focus on modeling diffusion processes and the use of statistical distributions, cs.SI and cs.SD are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses empirical data from a social networking app, which further supports the relevance of cs.SI and cs.SOC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
