The paper also discusses competition between data aggregators, which can be modeled as a game. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses statistical estimation, which is a core concept in machine learning. The paper also mentions the properties of statistical estimators used by data aggregators. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses mechanisms for ensuring the quality of data, which can be viewed as algorithms for processing data. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the principal-agent problem, which is a concept from information theory. The paper also discusses the ambiguity in incentivizing different data sources, which can be viewed as an information problem. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper discusses interactions between data aggregators and data sources, which can be modeled as a multi-agent system. The paper also discusses the burden of incentivizing different data sources, which can be viewed as a coordination problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
