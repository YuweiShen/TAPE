Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves learning from data, which suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of HDR sky database and 360{\\deg} panoramas suggests the category cs.GR (Computer Graphics). The paper also involves optimization and modeling, which suggests the category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves validation and comparison with previous state-of-the-art, which suggests the category cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
