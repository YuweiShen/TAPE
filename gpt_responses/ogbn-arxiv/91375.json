The paper also discusses the use of a simulation model, which falls under computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). The use of a database and sampling policy for the k-NN algorithm suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and the overall topic of freight forwarding and logistics could fall under information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
