The paper's focus on higher types suggests a connection to logic and type theory (cs.LO), while the use of parametricity and data abstraction suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper's use of formal methods and logic also suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and the paper's focus on interpretation and connections between different concepts suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
