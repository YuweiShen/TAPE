The paper specifically focuses on the use of constrained codes in Flash memories, which are a type of data storage device, making the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category also relevant. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed codes in terms of capacity and rate, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper introduces low-complexity encoding and decoding algorithms, which are typically studied in the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
