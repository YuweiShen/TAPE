The paper also discusses the use of these networks for autonomous learning, which is a topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of plasticity rules and network architectures, which are topics in Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the potential for these networks to be used in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY).
