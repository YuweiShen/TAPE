Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves algebraic modelling and polynomial equations, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SD (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses complexity bounds and practical timings of an implementation, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
