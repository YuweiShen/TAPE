The paper also deals with dynamical systems, which suggests the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The focus on geometric configurations and the use of Toeplitz operators suggests the category of Robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses decoupling of evolving modes, which is a common technique in the field of Dynamical Systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with interactions among agents, which suggests the category of Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
