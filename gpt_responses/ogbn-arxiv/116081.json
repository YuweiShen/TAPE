The use of sampling-based procedures and proxies for the Shapley value suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The experimental evaluation of the proposed solutions involves data analysis and statistical methods, which are relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the use of synthetic and real-world scenarios suggests a possible connection to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
