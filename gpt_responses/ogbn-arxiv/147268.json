The paper also discusses efficient methods for enumerating pointsets in Grassmannians, which is a problem in computational geometry (cs.CG) and combinatorics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper applies these techniques to line polar Grassmann codes, which have applications in systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
