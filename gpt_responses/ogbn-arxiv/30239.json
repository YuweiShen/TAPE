This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the minimum distance of these codes, which is a measure of their error-correcting capability. This connects the paper to the sub-category of coding theory (cs.DS). The construction of these codes involves algebraic curves, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses bounds on the parameters of these codes, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of long codes with small defects, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
