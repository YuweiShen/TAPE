The experiments conducted involve human participants, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of a Bellman objective and the formulation of planning as a recursive problem suggest a focus on reinforcement learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of cognitive control suggests a focus on systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
