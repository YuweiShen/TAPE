The paper also applies these methods to continuous control tasks, which are often studied in robotics and control theory (cs.RO, cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses a new theoretical result on the use of biased critics, which is relevant to the field of neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
