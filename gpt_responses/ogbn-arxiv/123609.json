This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses MNIST and ImageNet datasets to demonstrate the excessive invariance of deep neural networks. This indicates that the paper is related to computer vision and pattern recognition. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new objective to improve the performance of deep neural networks, which is a core area of research in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks, which is a topic of interest in cryptography and security. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the limitations of deep neural networks and proposes a new objective to overcome these limitations, which falls under the domain of neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
