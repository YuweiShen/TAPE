This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and optical networking (cs.OH). The paper also discusses different chromatic dispersion compensation and carrier phase recovery approaches, which are relevant to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and photonics (cs.PH). Finally, the paper involves numerical simulations, which could fall under the category of communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
