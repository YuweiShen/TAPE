Additionally, the use of deep neural networks and dynamic programming suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The focus on computational complexity and hardware performance suggests that it may also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
