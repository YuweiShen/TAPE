The experiments are conducted in the domain of activity recognition using video surveillance, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also addresses the issue of uncertainty, which is a common concern in cryptography (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
