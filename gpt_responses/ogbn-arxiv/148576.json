The paper also involves mapping between two different modalities, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of deep neural networks suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on learning a non-linear mapping suggests that it could also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
