The paper also proposes two novel graph mining primitives that can be applied to a wide variety of applications, such as social network analysis and uncertain graph analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DM (Data Mining), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
