Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a popular tool in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, suggesting that it could also fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of segmentation techniques to simplify and unify detection tasks, which could fall under the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category.
