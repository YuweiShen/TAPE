This involves analyzing millions of answers posted over a period of several years to uncover short-term and long-term changes in quality. The paper proposes four indicators of answer quality and examines the interplay between short-term deterioration in performance and long-term performance improvement. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are: \n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing, including issues related to online communities and collaboration. The paper's focus on collaborative knowledge production and user-generated content makes it a good fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis and modeling of social networks and other types of information networks. The paper's analysis of the dynamics of user performance in Stack Exchange, which is a type of social network, makes it relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the development and maintenance of software systems, including issues related to software quality and productivity. The paper's focus on answer quality and the factors that affect it, such as code lines and links, makes it relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category deals with the design and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
