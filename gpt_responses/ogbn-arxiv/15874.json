This involves managing a fleet of AVs to accommodate transportation requests, offering point-to-point services with ride sharing. The problem formulation and optimization methods involve mixed-integer linear programming, bilevel optimization, and genetic algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA), Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
