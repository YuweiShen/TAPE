The application of the system is for Pepper, a humanoid robot, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of deep neural networks also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a new system for object recognition, which involves training and optimizing the neural network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes the use of a Backpack for Pepper, which involves hardware implementation, which falls under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
