Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also analyzes the evolution of ads and tracking services on the Web, which falls under the sub-category cs.WEB (Web Technologies). Additionally, the proposed metrics involve temporal changes and diversity, which could be related to sub-categories such as cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity). Finally, the paper uses the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to collect retrospective data, which could be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
