The specific types of codes studied, locally repairable codes and partial MDS codes, are also relevant to distributed storage (cs.DS) and coding theory (cs.DC). The use of interleaved decoding may also be relevant to communication complexity (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
