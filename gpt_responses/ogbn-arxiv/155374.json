The use of pre-trained networks and fine-tuning is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the challenges of detecting flowers in cluttered and varying lighting conditions, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper uses performance metrics and generalization capability to evaluate the proposed method, which are common in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
