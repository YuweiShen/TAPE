The proposed Hierarchical Rule Induction Network (HriNet) involves multiple levels of rule embeddings and a gated embedding fusion module, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a rule similarity metric, which involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as word embeddings, and can be categorized under computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses a tuplet loss and similarity score to train and evaluate the model, which are techniques commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
