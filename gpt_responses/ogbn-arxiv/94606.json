The approach proposed in the paper involves the use of deep neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the issue of uncertainty in radar data, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
