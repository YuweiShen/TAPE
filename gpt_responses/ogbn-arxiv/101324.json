The paper also proposes a novel method for aligning multiple subspaces, which involves exploiting the natural geometry of the space of subspaces, on the Grassmann manifold. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
