The method involves using a Bayesian graph neural network as a surrogate function to automatically extract features from deep neural architectures and fit black-box objectives. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
