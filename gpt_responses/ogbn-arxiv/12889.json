Hence, cs.IR is another likely sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed method is based on deep learning, and hence, cs.LG is another possible sub-category. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper deals with a task that involves machine learning and NLP, which are both subfields of AI. Hence, cs.AI is another likely sub-category. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - The proposed method is based on deep learning, which is a subfield of neural computing.
