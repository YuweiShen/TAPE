The focus is on the large deviations behavior of the estimator, which is a topic of interest in statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of quantization and channel coding, which are common techniques in multimedia communication (cs.MM) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper provides insights into the behavior of the estimation error for multidimensional parameter vectors, which is relevant to machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
