The paper specifically focuses on the addition of learn-able parameters to the activation function, which falls under the category of neural network optimization and parameter tuning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nThe paper also evaluates the proposed activation function on image classification tasks, which falls under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the distribution of the learn-able parameters, which could be considered a statistical learning problem and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed activation function in natural language processing, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
