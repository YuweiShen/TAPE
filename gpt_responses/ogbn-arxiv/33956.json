The algorithm is based on discriminatively trained exemplar models, which are used to detect novelty in the visited states. This involves training classifiers to discriminate each visited state against all others, which requires image processing and computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The algorithm is also applied to robotics tasks, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
