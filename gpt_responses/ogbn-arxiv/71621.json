The paper proposes a simple baseline for fine-tuning GANs, which involves freezing the lower layers of the discriminator, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on various datasets, which could be related to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
