This is a common topic in machine learning and falls under the category of \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with deep learning methods and their applications, which can be categorized under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments are conducted on image datasets, which suggests that the paper can also be classified under \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision). The paper also deals with natural language processing tasks, which can be categorized under \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper proposes a mutual learning method, which can be categorized under \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
