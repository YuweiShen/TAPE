The focus is on discovering multimedia metrics that affect the effectiveness of online advertising and integrating them into the RTB framework. This suggests a strong connection to the multimedia field.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the bias in the ad displaying process in RTB and proposes a global optimization approach that considers the benefits of all stakeholders. This suggests a connection to information retrieval, as the goal is to optimize the relevance and effectiveness of ads for users.\n- cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper mentions auction theory as a component of the proposed framework, which suggests a connection to game theory. RTB involves auctions where advertisers bid for ad space, and the highest bidder wins. Game theory can be used to model and analyze such auctions.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a computation framework that integrates multimedia techniques and auction theory. This suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms, as the framework likely involves designing and implementing algorithms for processing and analyzing multimedia data and auction data.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper discusses the effectiveness of online advertising and the role of multimedia metrics in optimizing ad relevance and user engagement. This suggests a connection to computation and language, as natural language processing and text analysis may be used"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
