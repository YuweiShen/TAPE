The use of deep learning techniques for these tasks also suggests that the paper may fall under cs.AI and cs.LG. The application of the proposed method to autonomous driving and video surveillance also indicates a potential fit for cs.RO. Finally, the use of multispectral data and the focus on improving performance under low-light conditions suggests a possible fit for cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
