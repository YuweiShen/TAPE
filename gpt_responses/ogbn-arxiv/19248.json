The paper focuses on optimization problems with a limited budget of fitness evaluations, which is a common problem in practical systems. The proposed framework involves a Voronoi diagram to divide the search space into subspaces and operate local searches in potentially better subspaces. This approach is related to optimization and machine learning, which suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Among these categories, cs.NE and cs.AI are the most likely ones, as the paper focuses on evolutionary algorithms and surrogate models, which are common topics in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
