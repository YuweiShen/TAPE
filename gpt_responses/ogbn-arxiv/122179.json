The paper also discusses the use of behavioural models and real-time calibration, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of evolutionary algorithms for calibration is also a topic in machine learning (cs.MA). Finally, the paper mentions individual tracking and data analysis, which are topics in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
