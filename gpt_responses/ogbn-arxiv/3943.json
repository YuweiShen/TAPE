The paper also presents a formal specification and properties of the schema, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the operational procedures of constraint systems, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
