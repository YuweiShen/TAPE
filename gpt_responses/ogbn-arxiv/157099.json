This falls under the domain of information theory and communication systems, which are covered by the cs.IT and cs.COMM sub-categories. The paper also discusses the performance of different signaling schemes, which is related to signal processing and modulation techniques, covered by the cs.SI sub-category. The consideration of fading channels and full CSI also suggests a possible connection to wireless networks and networked systems, covered by the cs.NI sub-category. Finally, the optimization techniques used in the paper may also be relevant to machine learning and optimization, covered by the cs.MS sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
