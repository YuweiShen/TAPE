The paper also discusses the computational complexity of finding envy-free allocations, which is a common topic in theoretical computer science (cs.THE). The use of information withholding is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) to achieve fairness. The paper also discusses the use of algorithms to find optimal allocations, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with valuations and preferences, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
