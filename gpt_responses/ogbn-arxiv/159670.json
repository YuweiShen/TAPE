The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian sources and the MSE distortion measure, which are common in the subfield of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also touches upon the use of side information, which is relevant to cs.SI (Signal Processing). The paper also discusses coding schemes and achievable regions, which are relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
