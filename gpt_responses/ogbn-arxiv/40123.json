The use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) also suggests a possible fit in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also proposes novel algorithms that reduce computational complexity, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
