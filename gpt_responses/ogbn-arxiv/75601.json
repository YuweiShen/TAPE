Specifically, it introduces a new loss function called SimLoss that incorporates class similarities, which is relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM). Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories as they are directly related to the topic of the paper, while the others are also relevant but to a lesser extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
