This suggests that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The use of linear programming in the design and analysis of the algorithms suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories.
