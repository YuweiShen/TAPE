The paper proposes a statistical test that can detect adversarial examples by exploiting certain anomalies that adversarial attacks introduce. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer security (cs.CR), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
