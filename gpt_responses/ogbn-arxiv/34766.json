This approach is suited for constructive learning tasks where the option catalogue is generated on-the-fly. The paper also presents an upper bound on the average regret suffered by the learner. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves aspects of human-computer interaction (cs.HC), information retrieval (cs.IR), and cybersecurity (cs.CY) as it deals with user feedback and feature space extension."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
