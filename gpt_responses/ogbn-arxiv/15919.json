The paper also discusses time complexity and feasible functions, which are relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and programming languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The paper's focus on sorting algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of tools for extracting and solving higher-type recurrences suggests that it may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
