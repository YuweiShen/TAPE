The paper focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to SISR and proposes a method to reduce the number of parameters while maximizing SISR results. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, such as spindle blocks and SFFM, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the other likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
