The proposed algorithm involves the use of a deep neural network architecture (FS-Net) and an adaptive early termination algorithm, which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The modified searching process and the use of an approximation error are related to control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
