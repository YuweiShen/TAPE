The use of SVM classifier and feature extraction techniques such as histogram and CENTROG also suggest the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of thermal images and the need to handle low resolution and lack of color information may also suggest the involvement of the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
