This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper addresses technical challenges related to the faithful representation of existing pencil-and-paper proofs, which suggests that it may also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also deals with the extraction of verified static analyzers, which suggests that it may belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper's focus on Galois connections and monadic style suggests that it may also belong to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of metatheory suggests that it may also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
