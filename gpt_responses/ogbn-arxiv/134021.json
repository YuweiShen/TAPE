The paper proposes an inference framework, called the PL-based Inference Framework (PLIF), which permits a boundedly-rational approach to the CFP to be formally articulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. The paper draws on the psychological literature on causal judgment and proposes a notion called Potential Level (PL), which encodes the relative position of a node with respect to its neighbors in a causal Bayes net. The paper's focus on causal reasoning, Bayes nets, and algorithmic analysis suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper's use of Bayes nets and algorithmic analysis also suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on causal reasoning and inference suggests that cs.SY (Systems and Control) is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
