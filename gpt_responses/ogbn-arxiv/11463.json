The paper discusses various LR policies and their associated parameters, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and other AI applications (cs.AI). The paper also proposes a set of metrics for evaluating and selecting LR policies, which is relevant to optimization and search algorithms (cs.NE) and experimental design (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on a popular deep learning framework (Caffe), which is relevant to machine learning software and tools (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
