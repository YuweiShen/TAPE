The paper discusses the computational bottleneck of current state-of-the-art algorithms and proposes a new approach that only takes linear time and space. This suggests that the paper could belong to categories related to data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
