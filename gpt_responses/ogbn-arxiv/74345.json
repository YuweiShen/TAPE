The proposed adaptive sensing policy is driven by minimizing a surrogate function for mean squared error, which is a common objective in control systems. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an adaptive sensing policy for tracking dynamic targets, which is a common problem in AI. The paper also mentions the use of approximate dynamic programming solutions, which is a common technique in AI. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The problem of tracking dynamic targets is a common problem in robotics, especially in applications such as autonomous navigation and surveillance. The paper also mentions the use of sensing resources, which is a common concept in robotics. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of localization and estimation of dynamic targets, which is a classic problem in information theory. The paper also mentions the use of mean squared error as a performance metric, which is a common concept in information theory. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an adaptive sensing policy for tracking dynamic targets, which is a common problem in machine learning.
