This involves exploiting the sparsity of the data in some domains, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the proposed method involves reducing the data rate without sacrificing image quality, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of deep neural networks suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
