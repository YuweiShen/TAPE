Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves training a classifier, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper deals with security and privacy issues, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper involves crafting attack algorithms, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
