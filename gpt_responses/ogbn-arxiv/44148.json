This approach involves the use of hints, which are provided to users to help them conceptualize basic building blocks of the language faster and more efficiently. The paper also presents an empirical evaluation with 93 participants, which suggests that the employment of hints is successful, being especially beneficial for users with lower prior knowledge. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.HCI, as it deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. Other likely sub-categories include cs.DB (database systems), cs.CL (computational linguistics), cs.AI (artificial intelligence), and cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
