The paper also introduces a novel training strategy to improve the robustness of the trained network against sampling pattern discrepancy, which involves data augmentation and adversarial training, and this falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using image quality metrics, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
