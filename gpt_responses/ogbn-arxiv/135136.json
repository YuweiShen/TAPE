This is a key feature of databases, and the paper proposes a query language for Linked Data. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a formal semantics for evaluating SPARQL property paths on the Web, which involves reasoning about the structure of the Web graph. This is a common theme in AI research, and the paper could be of interest to researchers working on knowledge representation and reasoning. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a query language for Linked Data, which could be used to extract structured information from the Web. This is a common application of machine learning, and the paper could be of interest to researchers working on natural language processing and information extraction. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a query language for Linked Data, which involves searching for information across distributed data sources. This is a key feature of information retrieval, and the paper could be of interest to researchers working on search engines and recommendation systems. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a query language for Linked Data, which involves designing and implementing software systems that can navigate across distributed data sources.
