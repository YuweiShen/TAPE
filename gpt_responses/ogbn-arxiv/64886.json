Specifically, the paper proposes a novel method for low-bit quantization of neural networks that is differentiable and end-to-end. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on the theory and applications of machine learning, including neural networks.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers research on computer vision, which often involves the use of neural networks.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers research on neural networks and related topics, including their design, training, and optimization.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of data structures and algorithms, which are often used in machine learning and neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
