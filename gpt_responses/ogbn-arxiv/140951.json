The use of deep neural networks and data augmentation techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of wearable headsets in the title suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
