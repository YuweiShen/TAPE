This involves semantic segmentation of very high resolution images, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of forms in several applications, which suggests a potential interest in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of deep learning methods for segmentation and the creation of a new dataset also suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
