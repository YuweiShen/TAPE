Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The method also involves transfer learning and adaptation of pre-trained models, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of embeddings for identifying objects can also be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The method involves incorporating optical flow features, which is a common technique in video processing and can be related to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the method can also be applied to robotics and autonomous systems, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
