The use of hard positive and hard negative examples and the proposed trainable Generalized-Mean (GeM) pooling layer involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The reconstruction of 3D models and the use of structure-from-motion methods involve computer graphics (cs.MM). Finally, the fully automatic fine-tuning of CNNs without human annotation involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
