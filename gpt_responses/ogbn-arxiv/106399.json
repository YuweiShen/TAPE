The paper also discusses the need for new methods to handle rich and complex content, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The experiments described in the paper involve collecting data and analyzing stylistic features, which could be relevant to natural language processing and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of retrieved utterances in hotel dialogues, which could be related to software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
