The paper proposes a new method for trajectory computation, which involves visual data processing (cs.CV) and machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The proposed method also involves real-time adjustments to the trajectory, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses experimental results to validate the proposed method, which involves data analysis and statistical methods (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
