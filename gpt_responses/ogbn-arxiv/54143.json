The paper proposes a regularized least-squares approach to estimate the two vectors required for beamforming, without exploiting prior information. This problem is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), machine learning (cs.LG), and networked systems (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, which is a common issue in statistical inference and optimization problems, making the sub-category of statistical inference (cs.SI) also a likely fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
