The algorithms proposed in the paper involve counting the number of solutions to specific families of constraints, which suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the experimental evaluation of the proposed heuristics, which involves analyzing and interpreting data, suggesting a focus on machine learning (cs.LG).
