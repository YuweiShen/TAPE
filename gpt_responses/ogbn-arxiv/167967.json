The approach is based on layout features and uses Mask R-CNN for reference detection. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Deep Learning (cs.DL), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
