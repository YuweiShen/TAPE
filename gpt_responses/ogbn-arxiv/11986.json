The use of cognitive approach and semiotic knowledge representation suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the methodology. The fact that a coalition of robots is involved in the task indicates the possibility of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) being relevant. The study of spatial and behavior interaction of robots suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
