The paper also discusses the effectiveness of different performance measures and proposes a new methodology for evaluation, which involves analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers. This methodology involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI), statistical analysis (cs.LG), and robotics (cs.RO) to some extent. Finally, the paper also discusses the visualization of tracking results, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
