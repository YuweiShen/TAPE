Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep neural networks, which suggests it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
