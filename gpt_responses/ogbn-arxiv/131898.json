The method proposed in the paper is based on computer vision techniques, specifically deep learning and recurrent neural networks (cs.CV). The use of data-driven approaches and machine learning algorithms such as LSTM networks also suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.LG and cs.AI. Finally, the application of the method to collaborative robotics and the use of limited hardware for real-time processing suggests that the paper could also be classified under cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
