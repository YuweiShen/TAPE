This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for breast cancer classification, which involves the use of the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN) model. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for breast cancer classification using deep learning techniques. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network for breast cancer classification, which involves the use of the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN) model. This falls under the domain of neural computing, making cs.NE a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the classification of histopathological images, which are a form of multimedia data.
