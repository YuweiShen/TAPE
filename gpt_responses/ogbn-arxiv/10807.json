Additionally, the use of subwords as translation units and the comparison of pivot-based models with direct translation models are common topics in the field of natural language processing, which falls under the cs.CL category. \n\nThe paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as machine translation is a subfield of AI. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses the use of a phrase-based SMT model, which is a machine learning approach to machine translation. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with finding relevant information in low-resource settings. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as neural machine translation models are commonly used in the field of machine translation. However, as the paper focuses on a phrase-based SMT model, it is less likely to belong to this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
