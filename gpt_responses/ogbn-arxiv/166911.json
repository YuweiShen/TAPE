The use of dense constellations also has implications for signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the analysis of capacity loss involves mathematical expressions and calculations, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
