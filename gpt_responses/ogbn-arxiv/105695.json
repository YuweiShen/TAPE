The paper focuses on addressing the issue of overfitting in GATs, which is a common problem in many machine learning models. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since graph representation learning is a subfield of these areas. Additionally, the paper also discusses the interpretation of the removed edges, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) since these categories often deal with the analysis and interpretation of network data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
