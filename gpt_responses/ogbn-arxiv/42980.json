The use of high dimensional expanders and Ramanujan complexes suggests that the paper may also fall under computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the proof techniques used involve coboundary expansion and spherical buildings, which are concepts in algebraic topology (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
