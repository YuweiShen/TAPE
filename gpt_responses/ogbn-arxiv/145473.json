It also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it aims to improve user experience. The proposed training scheme and metric for robustness can be considered as machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories, respectively. Additionally, the use of adversarial training can be related to robotics (cs.RO) as it involves improving the performance of a system in the presence of disturbances."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
