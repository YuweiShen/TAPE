The main focus of the paper is on the notion of mutual information and common information, which are concepts studied in information theory. Therefore, cs.IT is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses hypercontractivity of product spaces, which is a topic in theoretical computer science and falls under cs.CC. The study of tradeoffs between different parameters is a common theme in computer science, and hence cs.DS is also a likely sub-category. The paper also deals with worst-case analysis, which is a topic in computer science theory and falls under cs.CR. Finally, the paper discusses the construction of a worst-case distribution, which is a topic in machine learning and falls under cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
