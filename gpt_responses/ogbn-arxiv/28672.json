The approach presented in the paper involves comparing texts in a common space of hidden topics, which is a technique commonly used in topic modeling. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and text matching, which are commonly used in sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper also mentions the benefits of incorporating domain knowledge to text matching, which is a common theme in sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
