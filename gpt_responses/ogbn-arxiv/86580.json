This topic falls under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with natural language processing and text analysis, which are part of the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The paper also involves artificial intelligence techniques for recommendation systems, which are part of the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
