This technique is commonly used in remote sensing and image processing, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses an optimization problem and a nonlocal regularization term, which are related to mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper compares the proposed method with several classical and state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
