The paper also addresses the challenge of certifying the correctness of neural networks, which is a problem in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The proposed framework involves using over-approximation to reduce the size of the network, which is a technique commonly used in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the integration of the proposed framework with existing verification techniques, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
