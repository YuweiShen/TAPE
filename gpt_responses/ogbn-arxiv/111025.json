The paper discusses the lack of evaluation standards and proposes an initial list of specifications for creating evaluation datasets. The example used in the paper is a sentence toxicity inference system, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL), making cs.CL the most likely sub-category. However, the paper also discusses the use of machine learning (ML) and the need for evaluation, which could place it in the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the ethical implications of bias in decision making, which could place it in the categories of cyber ethics (cs.CY) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
