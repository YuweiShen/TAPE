The proposed method involves modelling the shape as a triangular mesh, which is a common technique in computer graphics (CG). The paper also proposes an efficient discretisation of the unbounded 6-dimensional Lie group SE(3), which is a topic in robotics (RO) and mathematical modelling (MM). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.GR, followed by cs.RO, cs.CG, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
