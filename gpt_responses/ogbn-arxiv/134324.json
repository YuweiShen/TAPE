This involves image analysis and machine learning, which are typical topics in computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential clinical applications of the proposed method, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
