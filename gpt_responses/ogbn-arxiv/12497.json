The paper also discusses the practical implementation of a wearable bracelet as a jammer, which involves hardware design and engineering (cs.SY). The evaluation of the jammer under practical scenarios involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with disrupting audio recordings. Finally, the paper also discusses the limitations and areas for improvement, which could fall under the category of software development (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
