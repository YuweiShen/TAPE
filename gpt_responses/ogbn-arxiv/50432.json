The use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and diversity sampling also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The focus on tracking and forecasting also suggests that it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the use of socially-aware context for trajectory forecasting suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of trajectory forecasting techniques also suggests that it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
