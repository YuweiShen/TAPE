This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and embedded systems (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper proposes a new architecture for DNNs, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
