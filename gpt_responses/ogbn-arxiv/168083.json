The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of these STBCs, which is a topic related to signal processing and communications (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of full-diversity STBCs, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.ITP) and the construction of codes with low complexity is a topic related to network coding (cs.NI) and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
