This falls under the domain of programming languages. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The problem of disentangling locked processes is particularly relevant in distributed systems where processes may be blocked waiting for communication with other processes. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a refactoring procedure to improve the design of the code. This falls under the domain of software engineering. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses formal methods to characterise the class of processes that is not lock-free and to formalise the algorithm for detecting potential locks. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the problem of locked processes can also have security implications in distributed systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
