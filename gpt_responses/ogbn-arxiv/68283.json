The paper also introduces a new definition of regret, which is a common measure in optimization and decision making (cs.DS). The concept of calibration, which is mentioned in the paper, is also relevant to information theory and communication (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the interpretability of their definition of regret, which is a topic of interest in social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
