Specifically, the paper discusses a generalization of Fitch graphs, which are used to represent xenology relations between genes. This topic is closely related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS), as well as computational geometry (cs.CG), machine learning (cs.LG), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
