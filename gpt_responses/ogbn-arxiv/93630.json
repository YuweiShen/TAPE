It also involves the use of non-maximum suppression (NMS) which is a common technique in object detection. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of mean average precision (mAP) as the training loss, which is a common evaluation metric in computer vision tasks. This suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper introduces new gradient-like quantities for piecewise constant functions, which may be of interest to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper evaluates its method on the PASCAL VOC datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research, suggesting that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
