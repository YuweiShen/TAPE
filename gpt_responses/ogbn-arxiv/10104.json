The paper discusses a novel probabilistic graphical model for crowdsourcing tasks that do not fit the multiple-choice paradigm, and proposes a decision-theoretic controller to dynamically request responses. This suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories, as well as natural language processing (cs.CL) and cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories, which often involve free-response tasks. The use of probabilistic models and algorithms for joint parameter learning also suggests a potential fit with the social and information retrieval (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
