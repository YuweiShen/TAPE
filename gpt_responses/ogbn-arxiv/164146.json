Specifically, it discusses the weight distribution of linear codes, the Riemann Hypothesis Analogue for linear codes, and Duursma's reduced polynomial. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), system and control theory (cs.SD), and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
