This is a classic topic in computational complexity, and the paper is likely to be classified under this sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms for finding sparse multiples of polynomials, which is a problem related to data structures and algorithms. This sub-category is also a likely fit for the paper.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses concepts from information theory, such as sparsity and coding, to formulate and solve the problem of finding sparse multiples of polynomials. This sub-category is less likely than the previous two, but still a possible fit.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions the multiplicative order of elements in an extension field, which is a concept related to systems and control theory. However, this is a minor aspect of the paper, and it is unlikely to be classified under this sub-category.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper does not discuss any topics related to computational geometry, and it is unlikely to be classified under this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
