This involves using AI tools to explore software and find commits that are guessed to be problematic, and then having humans apply their expertise to check those guesses. The paper also discusses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this approach. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SE (Software Engineering), as it deals with improving software development processes. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.SD (Software Development)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
