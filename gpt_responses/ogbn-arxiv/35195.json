The proposed method is based on a conditional GAN, which is a popular deep learning technique for image generation (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of a face mask loss to reduce the influence of background changing, which is a technique related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework includes a module for facial expression recognition, which is a task related to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
