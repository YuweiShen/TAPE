The paper also involves a multidimensional oracle subset-sum problem, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The HomExt problem is related to list-decoding homomorphism codes, which is a topic in coding theory and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves algorithms and complexity analysis, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
