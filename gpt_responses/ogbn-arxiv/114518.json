This involves the use of automated driving and connectivity, which falls under the domain of robotics. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an ecological adaptive cruise controller (ECO-ACC) for a plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) which exploits automated driving and connectivity. This involves the use of AI techniques for real-time ecological velocity planning. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a two-level control framework for long-sighted ECO-ACC, which involves the use of a powertrain control mechanism to enhance PHEV energy prediction accuracy. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a two-level receding-horizon control framework for long-sighted ECO-ACC that utilizes historical SPaT for other traffic lights within a receding control horizon.
