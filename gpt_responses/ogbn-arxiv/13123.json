The paper also involves optimization of utility subject to privacy guarantees, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of differential privacy and distortion privacy also suggests the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the design of obfuscation mechanisms that anticipate and protect against optimal inference algorithms, which is related to the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
