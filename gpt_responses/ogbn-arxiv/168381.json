This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of heuristics to guide search, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves optimization of planning algorithms, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
