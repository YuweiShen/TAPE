This involves the use of data structures and algorithms to efficiently generate and manipulate these partitions. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with redistricting plans, which are inherently related to social and political networks. The algorithm is designed to generate non-partisan, neutral plans, which can have implications for social and political networks. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The algorithm involves the use of a measure that can be weighted with regard to a number of criteria, which can be seen as a form of machine learning. The algorithm can also be used to identify gerrymandered plans, which is a form of anomaly detection. \n4. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security) - The algorithm can be used to identify gerrymandered plans, which can have implications for the security and fairness of elections. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The algorithm involves the use of a Markov Chain to sample the space of redistricting plans, which can be seen as a form of game theory.
