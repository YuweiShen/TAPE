The paper also validates the proposed strategies through simulations and experiments with quadrotors, which are robotic platforms. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of multi-agent formations on Lissajous curves, which involves designing smooth trajectories and local cooperation schemes. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper focuses on multi-agent formation reconfiguration, which is a key problem in multiagent systems. The paper proposes a local cooperation scheme for achieving collision-free reconfiguration, which is a common approach in multiagent systems. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the objective of guaranteed sensor coverage of the area, which suggests the use of computer vision techniques for surveillance applications. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a strategy for rogue target detection and trapping, which involves decision-making and planning. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
