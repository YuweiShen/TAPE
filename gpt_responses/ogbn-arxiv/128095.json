The paper also discusses transmission schedules and queuing policies, which are related to information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper proposes a global-knowledge protocol that requires some information about the network topology, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions stability and injection rates, which are topics in systems and control theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of selectors, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
