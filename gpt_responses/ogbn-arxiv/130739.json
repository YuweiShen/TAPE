The use of solid-state depth sensors and image-driven sampling and reconstruction strategies also suggests a focus on graphics (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Additionally, the proposed algorithm for sampling and reconstruction is based on super-pixels, which is a common technique in computer vision and image processing (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
