The use of parity tree automata and the connection to Borel languages suggest a connection to descriptive set theory, which is a subfield of mathematical logic and set theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). \n\nThe paper also involves the study of regular tree languages and their complexity, which falls under the sub-category cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). The use of tree automata and the connection to decidability suggest a connection to algorithmic aspects, which is a subfield of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). \n\nThe paper also involves the study of regular tree languages and their definability, which falls under the sub-category cs.PL (Programming Languages).
