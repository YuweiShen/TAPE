This involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) as the module is designed to interact and negotiate with other vehicles. The use of a neural network for prediction involves machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Finally, the module's ability to manage busy scenarios involves aspects of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
