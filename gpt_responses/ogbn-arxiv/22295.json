The paper also mentions the use of feature extractors such as FAST, SIFT, and SURF, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of autonomous robots in glacial science, which could fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of near-infrared imagery, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the spatial structure of snow and ice, which could be related to graphics (cs.GR) research. Finally, the paper discusses the use of a custom camera rig, which could be related to robotics (cs.ROB) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
