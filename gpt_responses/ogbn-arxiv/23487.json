The paper also involves training discriminative classifiers, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of discriminative patches as a mid-level visual representation also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper could also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) if the concept of discriminative patches is extended to text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
