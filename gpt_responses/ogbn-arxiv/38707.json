The paper also discusses transfer learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The datasets used in the experiments are medical images, which fall under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new framework for weakly supervised learning, which could also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
