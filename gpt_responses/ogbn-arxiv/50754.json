This is a problem that is relevant to several areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and control systems (cs.SY). Given the focus on developing a novel active learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely categories. However, the use of information-theoretic auxiliary functions and adaptive submodularity also suggests cs.IT and cs.DS as possible categories. Finally, the application of the algorithm to a Bayesian experimental design task suggests cs.SY as a potential category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
