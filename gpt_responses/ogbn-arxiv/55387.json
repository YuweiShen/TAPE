The paper also discusses the complexity of decoding these codes, which could be relevant to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper proposes a new construction scheme for STBCs, which could be considered as a contribution to Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed codes through simulations, which could be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
