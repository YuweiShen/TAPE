The use of a branch-and-bound framework suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses lower bounds, which are often studied in the context of combinatorial optimization (cs.CO) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
