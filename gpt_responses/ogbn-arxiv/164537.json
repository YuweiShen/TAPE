The proposed approach involves sparsifying the alignment path search space for Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a widely used distance measure for time series. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
