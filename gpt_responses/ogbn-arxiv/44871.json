The focus on social collaboration and 3D visualization also suggests a potential fit with the sub-categories of virtual reality (cs.VR) and human-centered computing (cs.HCI). However, since these are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, they are less likely to be the primary sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
