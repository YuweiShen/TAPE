The paper also evaluates optimization algorithms borrowed from the machine learning literature, specifically stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which suggests a connection to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) for evaluating the performance of the algorithms. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of optimizing constraints, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
