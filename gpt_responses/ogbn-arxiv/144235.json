This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new architecture, DeepSperm, which involves deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data augmentation, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions tuning hyper-parameters to achieve better performance, which is a common practice in neural networks and optimization algorithms, falling under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with processing videos, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
