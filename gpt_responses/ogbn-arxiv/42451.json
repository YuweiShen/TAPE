The paper also discusses the kinetostatic criteria for the design, which involves system dynamics and control (cs.SY) and computational engineering (cs.CE) concepts. Additionally, the paper mentions high-speed machining (cs.MM) as a motivation for exploring alternative machine tool designs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
