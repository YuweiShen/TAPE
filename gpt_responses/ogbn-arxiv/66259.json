This involves learning point descriptors with holistic context to enhance robustness to geometric transformations. The paper also introduces Geometry Similarity Connection (GSC) modules that exploit Eigen-Graph to group distant points with similar and relevant geometric information, and aggregate features from nearest neighbors in both Euclidean space and Eigenvalue space. This design allows the network to efficiently capture both local and holistic geometric features such as symmetry, curvature, convexity, and connectivity. Given these characteristics, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes a new network architecture for 3D point cloud classification and segmentation that addresses the challenge of large geometric transformations. This involves learning point descriptors with holistic context to enhance robustness to geometric transformations. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new network architecture that involves learning point descriptors with holistic context to enhance robustness to geometric transformations. This is a machine learning problem that involves designing a network architecture that can effectively capture both local and holistic geometric features. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new network architecture that involves learning point descriptors with holistic context to enhance robustness to geometric transformations.
