The approach proposed in the paper is based on selecting a small subset of dimensions of y, and modeling x to y_L and y_L to y. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
