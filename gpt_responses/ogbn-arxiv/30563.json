The use of wireless communication and signal strength measurement suggests a possible connection to mobile computing (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The methodology proposed in the paper also involves the use of hidden Markov models, which could be relevant to cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
