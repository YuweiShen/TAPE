This is a fundamental aspect of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes a novel ambient backscatter multiple-access system, which is a type of wireless network. The analysis and design of such networks fall under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the practical design of the backscatter multiple-access system, which involves the integration of hardware and software components. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but the proposed system can potentially be used for multimedia communication, such as audio and video streaming.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not deal with social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the development of new technologies that can impact society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
