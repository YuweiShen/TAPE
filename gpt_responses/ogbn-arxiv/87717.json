Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of realistic human body mobility models and channel models, which suggests a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nAdditionally, the paper evaluates the resilience of existing broadcast strategies and the proposed protocol, which could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
