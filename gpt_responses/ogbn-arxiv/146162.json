The proposed End-to-End framework involves the use of cellular automata models, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper also discusses the challenges of feature selection and the need for a generic approach, which could be relevant to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
