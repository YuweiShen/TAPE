The focus on making as few assumptions as possible about the environment suggests a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the experiments and implementation of the algorithms suggest a potential connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
