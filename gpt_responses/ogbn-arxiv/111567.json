This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The system presented in the paper can be used in robotics for detecting fallen people and providing assistance. \n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on detecting falls in elderly people, which is a human-centric problem. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The system presented in the paper uses a CNN-based human pose estimator, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The system presented in the paper uses a reasoning module to formulate measures to reason whether a person is fallen, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
