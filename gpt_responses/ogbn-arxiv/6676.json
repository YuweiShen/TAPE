Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. The paper also discusses the use of spatial resources and the physical characteristics of the uniform linear array (ULA), which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also focuses on the spectral efficiency of the system, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
