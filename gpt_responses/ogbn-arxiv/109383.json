This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a novel sparse signal recovery operator with sampling distortion, which involves signal processing techniques.\n3. cs.SP (Statistical Signal Processing): The paper discusses the use of sparse signal recovery techniques for wideband spectrum sensing, which falls under the scope of statistical signal processing.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of cognitive radio for mobile communication, which involves networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the denoising ability of the proposed method, which is a common problem in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
