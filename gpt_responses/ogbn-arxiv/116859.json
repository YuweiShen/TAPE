The method is designed to handle large-scale problems with a large number of variables, which suggests it may be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) or data mining (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses a new technique for probing separability, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
