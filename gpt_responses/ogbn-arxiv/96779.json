This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper studies the impact of endogenous network formation on social learning. This is a key area of research in social and information networks, making cs.SI a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the concept of maximal learning, which is a natural extension of asymptotic learning. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper studies social learning in a model where agents move sequentially and make strategic decisions based on their private signals and observations of past actions. This falls under the domain of computational social science, making cs.SOC a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the impact of various settings in the model on the learning probability. This involves analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and data structures, making cs.DS a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
