The use of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) and successive decoding techniques also suggests a focus on system design and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions simulation results and comparisons with other multiple access techniques, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
