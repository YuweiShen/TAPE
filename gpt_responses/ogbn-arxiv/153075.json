The use of feedback to allocate or adapt power across transmission attempts is a control problem, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The dynamic programming and geometric programming approaches used to solve the optimization problems are related to optimization and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the application of the results to wireless communication systems involves the use of signal processing techniques (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
