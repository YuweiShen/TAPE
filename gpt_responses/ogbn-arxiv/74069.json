This is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper involves coding techniques for streaming, which is a core topic in information theory. The paper also discusses the net throughput and energy consumption, which are important performance metrics in information theory.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with streaming of multimedia content and compares different coding schemes based on their performance. This is a key area of research in multimedia.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the impact of coding at the application layer on net data throughput and energy consumption, which are important considerations in distributed and parallel computing.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper involves the design and analysis of a streaming system with different coding schemes and performance metrics.
