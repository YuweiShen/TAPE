The paper also proposes a novel graph-structured module and a conditional-margin loss function, which are related to deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of different domains such as NIR and sketch also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
