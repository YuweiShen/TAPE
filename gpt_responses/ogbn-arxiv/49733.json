Additionally, it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as SVMs are commonly used in AI applications. The paper also mentions the use of SVMs in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the use of budgeted stochastic gradient descent, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
