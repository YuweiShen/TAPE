The proposed approach involves modifying the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer, which is a common technique used in deep learning models, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using retrieval framework, which suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
