The use of Deep Neural Networks for representing meta-policies suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The focus on autonomous driving and the use of reinforcement learning suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Robotics (cs.RO). The use of sensing noise and obstacles suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of hierarchical learning and the focus on control policies suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
