The use of structured sparsity models and clustering algorithms also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes the use of earth mover's distance (EMD) as a metric, which is commonly used in similarity and distance measures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
