The paper also discusses sparse recovery algorithms and performance guarantees, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper provides tips and tricks for designing CS-based wireless communication systems, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves optimizing system performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
