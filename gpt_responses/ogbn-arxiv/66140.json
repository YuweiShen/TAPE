Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves isogenies, which are a topic in algebraic geometry and number theory, suggesting that it could also be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper involves cryptographic protocols, which could place it under cs.CRYPTO (Cryptology) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
