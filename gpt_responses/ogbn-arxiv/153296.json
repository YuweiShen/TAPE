Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the challenges of distortion and inefficiency in projection techniques, which are related to graphics (GR) and multimedia (MM). The proposed method involves a two-stage object detector, which is a combination of region proposal network and reprojection network, indicating the involvement of robotics (RO) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
