It may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it involves the detection of neuronal boundaries. Additionally, it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a multi-stage multi-recursive-input fully convolutional network for the task. It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves the development of a biologically-plausible network for neuronal boundary detection. Finally, it may belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves the use of convolutional networks for image segmentation, which is a common technique in natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
