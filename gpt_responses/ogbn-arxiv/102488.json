It also involves text data and explores the vast data to compute k-nearest neighbors using both image and text. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, since the paper deals with natural language processing and text matching, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves multimodal data, which can fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
