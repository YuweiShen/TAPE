The proposed method involves feature learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a hyper-dense fusion mechanism, which is a technique used in deep learning and machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments involve the use of public datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
