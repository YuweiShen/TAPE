This involves training a recurrent neural network to encode POMDP strategies and using it to improve the strategy by iteratively training the RNN. \n2. cs.LG - The paper uses a recurrent neural network to encode POMDP strategies and improve them iteratively. This falls under the category of machine learning. \n3. cs.RO - The paper deals with partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which are commonly used in robotics. The proposed method can be used to generate strategies for robots that adhere to temporal logic constraints. \n4. cs.SY - The paper proposes a method for synthesizing strategies for POMDPs that involves formal verification. This falls under the category of systems and control. \n5. cs.PL - The paper deals with temporal logic specifications, which are commonly used in programming languages. The proposed method can be used to generate strategies that adhere to temporal logic constraints in programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
