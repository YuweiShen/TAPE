The paper also discusses the impact of massive MIMO on channel training time, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a pilot-based channel estimation method, which involves system-level design and optimization, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
