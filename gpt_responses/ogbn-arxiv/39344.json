The paper mentions the use of deep learning models and clustering algorithms, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and ML for language-related tasks. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of BERT, a popular pre-trained language model, which is commonly used in various NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and text generation. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which focuses on techniques for retrieving relevant information from large collections of text. \n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions the use of cloud storage and collaboration, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), which focuses on the development of algorithms and models for learning from data. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of KMeans clustering, which is a common unsupervised learning algorithm. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which focuses on the development of intelligent agents and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning models, which are commonly used in various NLP tasks.
