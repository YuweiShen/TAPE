This involves an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation that enables end-to-end training. The paper also discusses the use of surface-based representations in the volumetric-learning framework. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR). The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques, as well as multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
