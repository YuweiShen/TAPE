The paper also mentions the use of a web image index and a commercial search engine, indicating a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of judges and their personal preferences, which could be related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category.
