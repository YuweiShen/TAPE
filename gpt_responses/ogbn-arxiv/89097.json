The use of greedy and local search algorithms suggests a focus on approximation algorithms and heuristics, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG). The mention of perturbation-stable instances and worst-case approximation guarantees suggests a focus on theoretical computer science (cs.IT) and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
