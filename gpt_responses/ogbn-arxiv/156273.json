The use of random sampling and analysis of error probability bounds suggest that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The use of large external image databases and optimization of sampling patterns suggest that multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant. Finally, the use of numerical experiments suggests that data structures (cs.DS) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
