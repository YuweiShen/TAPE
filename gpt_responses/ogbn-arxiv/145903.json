The problem also involves side information at the decoder, which is a common theme in cs.SI (Signal Processing). The paper also discusses the error probability of decoding, which is related to cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of probability and lower bounds suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
