Hence, it can be categorized under this sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Active inference is a type of reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. Therefore, it can be categorized under this sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - Active inference can be seen as a control theory approach to decision-making, where the goal is to minimize prediction errors. Hence, it can be categorized under this sub-category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - Active inference involves making predictions about the environment based on sensory information, which can be seen as an information processing task.
