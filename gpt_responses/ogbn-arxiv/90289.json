The method involves combining rejection sampling with particle filtering, which are both commonly used in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also discusses tracking time-dependent parameters in online settings, which is a common topic in control systems (cs.SY). The paper provides numerical examples of the method applied to MNIST classification problems, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the method, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
