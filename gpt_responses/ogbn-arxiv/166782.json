The paper proposes a new initialization method based on random walks to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The paper provides mathematical analyses and experimental results related to the MNIST and TIMIT datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
