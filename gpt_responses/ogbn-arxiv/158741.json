The paper focuses on the application of this method to hyper-parameter tuning of neural networks and automated machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The method also involves a multi-armed bandit problem, which suggests a possible fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
