This falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a design algorithm for building a collection of mutually orthogonal complementary set matrices. This involves the use of data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the design of complementary set matrices for wireless communication systems, which are a type of information network. The paper may also discuss the use of these matrices in other types of networks.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a cost function for selecting companion pairs of sequences that satisfy a column correlation constraint. This involves the use of optimization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of reducing the PAPR of transmitted signals, which is a common problem in multimedia communication systems. The paper may also discuss the use of complementary set matrices in other multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
