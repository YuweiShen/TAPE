The paper also uses graph-theoretic concepts and constructions (cs.DS) to prove some of its results. Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of computational complexity and the existence of equilibria (cs.CC), as well as the use of algorithms and optimization techniques (cs.AI) to construct examples of games that require larger supports. Finally, the paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in its analysis of the payoff guarantees of different equilibria."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
