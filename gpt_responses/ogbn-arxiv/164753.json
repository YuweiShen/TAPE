The paper also discusses the use of fuzzing techniques to find these bugs, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The methodology used in the study involves evaluating the impact of the bugs on the compiled application, which could be considered a systems and control (cs.SY) topic. Finally, the paper presents a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
