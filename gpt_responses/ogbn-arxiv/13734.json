This involves using a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. The paper also explores different reward signals for training the DVSL controller. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (artificial intelligence) and cs.LG (machine learning), as the paper involves the use of deep reinforcement learning to develop an autonomous control agent. The paper also involves control systems (cs.SY), robotics (cs.RO), and transportation (cs.TR) as it deals with traffic control and management."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
