This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed Deep Class-Encoder model uses class labels to learn discriminative representation for the given sample by mapping the learned feature vector to its label. This involves machine learning techniques. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for gender and ethnicity classification, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with iris images, which are a type of multimedia data. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper focuses on reducing the search space significantly, which is a common problem in information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
