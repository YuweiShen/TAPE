The use of a 3D head model and the assessment of the effectiveness of the synthesis procedure in CNN training suggest that the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The potential use of the synthesized images in law enforcement and biometric verification experiments suggests that the paper may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of a sampling pool and comparison with popular GAN models suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
