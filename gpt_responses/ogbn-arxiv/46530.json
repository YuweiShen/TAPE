The use of precoders and outer codes suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI), while the consideration of channel statistics and selectivity characteristics suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and the mention of geometric intuition suggest a focus on multimedia and signal processing (cs.MM), while the consideration of code design suggests a focus on computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
