The paper proposes a teaching-based approach to solve this problem, which involves selecting a small subset of data to lead the human user to the correct inference. This approach is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with interpreting and disseminating knowledge. The paper also mentions the use of simulation and sampling, which are relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
