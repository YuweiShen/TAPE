The authors also mention the use of algorithms and computational complexity theory (cs.DS) to solve the problem. Additionally, they propose a new variant of the problem that involves assigning activities to connected subgroups, which could fall under the category of social influence (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses finding stable outcomes, which is a common goal in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
