The paper proposes a new method for trainable greedy decoding that uses a small neural network actor to manipulate the hidden state of a previously-trained decoder. This method is inspired by earlier work on reinforcement learning for beam search, but does not require reinforcement learning and can be trained reliably on a range of models. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of neural networks in the proposed method could also make it relevant to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve parallel corpora and architectures, which could make it relevant to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
