The use of prototypes to explain the decisions is also a popular area of research in explainable AI. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. The paper also deals with time-series data and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI) research. Additionally, the paper mentions optimizing for prototype diversity, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
