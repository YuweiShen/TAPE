It specifically focuses on constant composition codes, which are a type of error-correcting code (cs.CC). The use of large deviations theory suggests a connection to probability and statistics (cs.DS), and the study of rare events is also relevant to the field of simulation and modeling (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of upper and lower bounds suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
