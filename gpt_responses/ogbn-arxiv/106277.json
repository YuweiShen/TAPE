This suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and complexity analysis, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of combinatorial surfaces and triangulation suggests cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.GR (Computer Science and Robotics) as possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
