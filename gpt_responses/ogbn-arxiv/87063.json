The algorithms presented in the paper involve conditional planners, which is a subfield of planning (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the construction of a plan graph, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO). The probabilistic approach used in the paper involves probability models, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of a probability dependence model, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
