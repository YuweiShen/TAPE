The paper also introduces a new variant of choreographic programming, which is a programming-language design approach (cs.PL). The paper discusses the interplay between failures and collective communications, which is a topic in Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper also introduces a type system that ensures that choreographies can be realized despite changing availability conditions, which is a topic in Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper deals with Cyber-Physical Systems, which is a topic in Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
