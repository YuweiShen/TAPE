The paper also discusses capacity bounds and the optimality of the proposed schemes, which are topics in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also considers adversarial channels and the security of the communication, which are topics in computer security (cs.CR). The paper proposes natural and efficient protocols that do not employ any coding, which are topics in distributed systems (cs.DS) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
