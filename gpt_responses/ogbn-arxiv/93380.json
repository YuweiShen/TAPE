The proposed method combines high-level policy anticipation with low-level context reasoning, using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to anticipate the vehicle's driving policy and an optimization-based reasoning process to adapt to different traffic configurations. This work involves robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the context of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), and it also has applications in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
