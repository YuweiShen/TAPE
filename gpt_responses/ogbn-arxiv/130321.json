The paper also proposes a framework for validating the robustness of these systems, which involves machine learning techniques such as Locally Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME), which are commonly used in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) research. The paper also discusses the use of word embeddings, which are a common tool in NLP and machine learning research, and may be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the creation of a new dataset, which may be relevant to researchers in computer vision (cs.CV) who work with image-based question answering systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
