This is a core topic in machine learning and falls under the purview of cs.LG.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the optimization of automated decision systems, which is a key area of research in AI. The proposed method of data minimalism also aligns with the broader goal of developing AI systems that can operate with minimal data.\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper touches upon the ethical implications of data collection and usage, which is a key area of research in the field of computers and society. The concept of data minimalism also has implications for privacy and data protection.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the sensitivity analysis of data points, which is a technique used in cryptography and security to identify vulnerabilities in systems. The proposed method of data minimalism can also have implications for data security.\n5. cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a method to compute the value of individual data points, which is a key area of research in databases. The concept of data minimalism also has implications for database design and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
