The paper also discusses algorithms for finding the global optimal estimates of correct task answers and worker quality, which involves computational complexity and optimization, making it relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions filtering and rating tasks, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
