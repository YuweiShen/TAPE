This involves information theory (cs.IT) and communication theory (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses a framing method for variable-length codes, which could fall under signal processing (cs.SI) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed codes, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
