The use of a ConvNet and multi-task learning also suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The integration of a 3D model and the focus on object structures could also potentially place the paper in the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper addresses issues with object detection, which could potentially place it in the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
