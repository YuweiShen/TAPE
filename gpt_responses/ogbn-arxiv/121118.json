The use of photogrammetry and virtual reality also suggests that it may belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category as the paper discusses the use of photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation. The integration of vehicle dynamics and proprioceptive measurements suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of synthetic measurements and vehicle-in-the-loop experiments suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
