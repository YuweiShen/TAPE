This makes cs.CC (Computational Complexity) the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial and algebraic techniques, which suggest cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as possible sub-categories. The study of Kronecker coefficients and plethysms involves representation theory, which could place the paper in cs.SD (Systems and Control) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
