The concept of locally repairable codes is used, which is a topic in coding theory and distributed storage (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the number of bits that can be securely stored, which is related to capacity and information theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes a system that is secure against a passive eavesdropper, which is a topic in security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
