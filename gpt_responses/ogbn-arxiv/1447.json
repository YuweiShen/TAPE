This involves the use of algorithms and methods based on linear estimation theory, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods and proposes a novel approach, which involves the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, falling under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the influence of noise in PMU data, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
