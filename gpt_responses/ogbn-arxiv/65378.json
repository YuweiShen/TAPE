The use of shifts and configurations over a finite alphabet in $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ suggests a connection to discrete mathematics and combinatorics, which are also relevant subfields of computer science. The paper's focus on quasiperiodic shifts and their expressive power suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper's use of minimal shifts and their representation as factors of projective subdynamics suggests a connection to dynamical systems (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the paper's discussion of Kolmogorov complexity suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
