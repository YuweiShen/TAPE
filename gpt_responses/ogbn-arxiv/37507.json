The approach treats leaf counting as a direct regression problem and only requires the total leaf count per plant as annotation. The paper also argues that combining different datasets when training a deep neural network is beneficial and improves the results of the proposed approach. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
