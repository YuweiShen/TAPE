Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also mentions the use of regularization and loss functions, which are common in the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
