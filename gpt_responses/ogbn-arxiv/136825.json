The paper also discusses the performance of various models and their optimization, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper's focus on learning invariant relational reasoning tasks suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper's use of a mixture-of-experts architecture suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
