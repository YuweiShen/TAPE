The proposed method involves solving a nonlinear objective function, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also involves dimensionality reduction, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
