This suggests a focus on practical applications of machine learning rather than theoretical research, which is consistent with the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also emphasizes the importance of adherence to a strict process, which suggests a focus on software engineering and development, consistent with the sub-category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data and the creation of data-driven models, which suggests a focus on databases and data management, consistent with the sub-category of cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the paper discusses the creation of \"minimum viable\" models, which suggests a focus on practical applications and real-world impact, consistent with the sub-category of cs.CE (Computational Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
