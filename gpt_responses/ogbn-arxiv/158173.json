The paper proposes a novel family of GANs that can learn a clean label conditional generative distribution even when training labels are noisy, which is a problem that is relevant to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in general. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses evaluation metrics related to image quality and classification accuracy, which are relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
