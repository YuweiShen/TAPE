The algorithm involves permutation-based encryption, which also relates to information theory (cs.IT). The encryption is applied to images, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the computational complexity of the algorithm, which relates to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
