It also involves the study of length distribution and bounds, which are typical of formal languages (cs.FL) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of binary trees and sequences suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.CC), while the study of non-commutative versions of theorems points to the field of graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
