Additionally, the use of a complex systems approach and the consideration of psycholinguistic evidence suggest a machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) focus. The paper also touches on the interaction of word order and memory, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the consideration of typological evidence suggests a potential focus on social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
