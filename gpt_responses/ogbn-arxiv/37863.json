The authors also propose machine learning-based solutions for intrusion detection, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also touches upon the challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises in adapting to these security challenges, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of cloud-storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approaches also brings up the topic of network infrastructure (cs.NI). Finally, the concept of Industry 4.0 involves a high degree of intercommunication and embedded computation, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
