This algorithmic aspect falls under numerical analysis. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, but group sparse recovery is a problem that arises in network analysis, where one wants to identify groups of nodes that are jointly active. \n- cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper's main focus is on group sparse recovery, which is a problem in signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
