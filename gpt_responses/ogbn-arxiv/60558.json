This is a common problem in machine learning, particularly in areas such as computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The method is also applicable to deep neural networks (cs.NE) and involves linear and nonlinear transformations, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
