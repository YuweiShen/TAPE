The proposed approach involves the use of sub-networks to handle variations in appearance due to changing capturing conditions, which is a technique that is commonly used in robotics (cs.RO). The method also involves the computation of global image descriptors, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on challenging benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
