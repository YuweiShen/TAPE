The library supports numerous neural network models, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The library is designed to perform on par with the results reported in published papers, which involves optimization (cs.NE). The library covers tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation, which involves multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
