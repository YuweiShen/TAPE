This involves analyzing digitized whole slides of histologic patterns and using the clusters as covariates to train Cox-proportional hazard survival models. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as well as Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) due to the use of natural language processing techniques to assign clinical terminology to the significant clusters. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category due to the use of Cox-proportional hazard survival models for predicting prognosis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
