This topic is closely related to computer networks (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY), as well as distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges and benefits of service shifting, which could involve security and cryptography (cs.CR) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
