This topic falls under the field of information theory and communication systems, which is covered by the cs.IT and cs.COMM sub-categories. The paper also proposes a systematic construction of CZCPs based on generalised Boolean functions (GBFs), which involves computational methods and algorithms, making the paper relevant to the cs.SI and cs.DS sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses numerical simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CZCPs, which falls under the field of networked systems and protocols, making the paper relevant to the cs.NI sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
