Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) due to the use of image-based input. The paper also deals with robotics (cs.RO) as the ViZDoom environment simulates combat scenarios, and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) due to the use of deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
