Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for coreference resolution, which falls under the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the comparison of the proposed approach with other annotation schemes, which could be relevant to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
