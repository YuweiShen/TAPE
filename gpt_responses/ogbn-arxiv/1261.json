The paper proposes a new model for the residual signal in speech production, which can be applied in various speech processing applications. Therefore, cs.SD (Sound) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of the proposed model in speech synthesis and speaker identification, which are both subfields of natural language processing. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also highlights some computational properties of the proposed model, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of glottal signatures derived from the proposed model for speaker identification, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
