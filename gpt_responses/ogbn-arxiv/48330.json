This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper involves training these models using weak supervision, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of an artificially generated dataset also involves the use of synthetic data, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves natural language processing techniques for text recognition on grocery shelves, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves the application of these techniques to grocery shelves, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
