The paper focuses on improving the network performance and reducing overfitting. The approach is evaluated on various tasks such as classification and detection. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, since the paper proposes a new approach for training deep neural networks, it can also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
