The use of Kalman filtering and lattice quantization suggests that the paper may also fall under the signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The simulation example in the paper may also suggest a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the focus on average mean squared error fidelity criterion may suggest a fit for the statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
