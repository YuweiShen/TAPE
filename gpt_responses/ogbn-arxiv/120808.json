This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as software engineering (cs.SE) since it involves designing and implementing secure protocols. Additionally, the paper discusses the requirements and implementation details of the integration, which could fall under the categories of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also mentions prototype implementations for open-source TLS libraries, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.DL) if the libraries use machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
