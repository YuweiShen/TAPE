This makes it highly likely that the paper belongs to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the optimization of deep neural networks, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of regularization techniques, which is a common topic in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on image datasets, which is a common topic in the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
