The proposed approach focuses on obfuscating convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are widely used for image recognition (cs.CV). The paper also involves training a simulation network using intermediate knowledge and data labels, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of protecting the critical structure of a deep learning model, which can be considered a software engineering problem (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
