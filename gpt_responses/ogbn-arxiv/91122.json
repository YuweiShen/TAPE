This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of numerical implementations for the computation of minimal paths suggests that the paper may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
