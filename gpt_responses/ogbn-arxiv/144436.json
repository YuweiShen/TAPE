The use of reduction from SAT suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The puzzle involves manipulating blocks on a lattice, which suggests that computational geometry (cs.CG) may also be relevant. Finally, the use of the term \"unit square blocks\" suggests that the paper may also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL), specifically in the context of data types and structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
