This technique is related to signal processing, communication, and networking, which are covered by the arXiv categories cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.COMM (Communication and Networking), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SP (Signal Processing). Among these categories, cs.IT and cs.COMM are the most likely categories as they directly relate to the paper's focus on improving the performance of GFDM in broadband channels. The other categories are also relevant as they cover related topics such as network architecture and social networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
