The use of subgoals and options in the approach also suggests a potential fit with robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper specifically mentions testing the approach on games from the Atari suite, which suggests a potential fit with computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
