Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of ConvNet fusion, which falls under the category of machine learning, specifically deep learning. This makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the application of pedestrian detection in autonomous driving, which falls under the category of robotics, making cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of multispectral images, which falls under the category of multimedia, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
