This makes it highly likely to belong to the Logic (cs.LO) category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a resolution calculus, which is commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for automated theorem proving. The paper also discusses the use of primitive recursive definitions, which are relevant to Programming Languages (cs.PL). The use of projections and schemata suggests a connection to Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
