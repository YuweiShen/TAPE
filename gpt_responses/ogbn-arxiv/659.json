The focus is on the use of hashing techniques for efficient similarity estimation in large-scale scenarios. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DB (databases), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.IR (information retrieval), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.AI (artificial intelligence). Among these, cs.DB and cs.DS seem to be the most likely categories, as they are directly related to the efficient handling of large-scale data. However, cs.IR, cs.LG, and cs.AI are also possible categories, as they are closely related to machine learning and data mining, which are the main applications of similarity computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
