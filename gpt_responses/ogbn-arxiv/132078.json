This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian inference (cs.AI) and ensemble learning (cs.NE) techniques. Additionally, the paper uses image datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) which are commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CV) and discusses the use of active learning (cs.CL) in one of the experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
