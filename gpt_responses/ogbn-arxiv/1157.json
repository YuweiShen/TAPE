The paper also discusses the construction of planar morphs with polynomially-bounded resolution, which could fall under the category of graph drawing (cs.GR) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper considers both upward drawings of rooted trees and drawings of arbitrary trees, which could be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
