The use of percentile ranks and fractional counts is particularly relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and digital libraries (cs.DL), where citation analysis is commonly used to evaluate the impact of research publications. The study also involves statistical analysis and classification of journals into broad fields, which could be related to sub-categories such as social and information networks (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and computational complexity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
