The paper uses typical methods to obtain level-1 representations, which involves image descriptors and bag-of-words model for word tags. The paper then proposes a bimodal auto-encoder to learn the similarities/dissimilarities between the pairwise image-tags as level-3 representations. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques for word tag representations. Finally, the paper deals with multimedia (cs.MM) data, which further supports the likelihood of it belonging to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
