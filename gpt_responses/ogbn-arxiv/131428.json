The integration of tactile and visual sensing also suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a likely sub-category. The use of a framework for solving the SLAM problem (iSAM) and the adaptation of its cost functions suggest machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the exploration of the technique in different scenarios and the evaluation of estimation quality suggest artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
