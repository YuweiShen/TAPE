The use of a rotatable region proposal network and rotatable detection network involves complex geometric transformations, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper also mentions experiments on aerial videos, indicating the potential involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
