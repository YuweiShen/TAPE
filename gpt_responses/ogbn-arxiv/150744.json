The proposed model uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and image-to-image translation techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new model for handwritten recognition using GANs, which is a popular machine learning technique. The model also incorporates Sliced Wasserstein distance and U-Net architectures, which are commonly used in machine learning research.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of recognizing text from handwritten records, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed model aims to improve the accuracy of text recognition, which is an important task in information retrieval.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with the problem of recognizing text from handwritten records, which is a common problem in natural language processing.
