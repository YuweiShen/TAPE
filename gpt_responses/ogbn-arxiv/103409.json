The use of non-convex optimization heuristics such as alternating minimization is also a common approach in these fields. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.IT (Information Theory)\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
