The proposed solution leverages the spatial dimensionality of large-scale antenna arrays, which is a key feature of massive MIMO (cs.MM). The paper also uses compressive sensing techniques, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
