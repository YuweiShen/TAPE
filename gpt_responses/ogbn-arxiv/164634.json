The paper also discusses adversarial attacks and defenses, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for training neural networks, which falls under the category of neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
