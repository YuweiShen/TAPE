This falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also introduces a new framework to construct ML decoders for STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph based Sum-Product Algorithm, which could fall under the category of Signal Processing (cs.SI) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the complexity reduction achieved by the GDL decoder compared to the Conditional ML (CML) decoder, which could fall under the category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC) or Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
