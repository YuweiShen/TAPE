It also involves the computation of characteristic functions for various sequences, which is related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT). The study of automatic sequences and their properties also has connections to the theory of dynamical systems (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
