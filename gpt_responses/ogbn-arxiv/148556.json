The paper proposes a novel approach that uses a known BRDF dictionary to estimate the surface normal and BRDF at each pixel. This approach involves solving a non-convex optimization problem, which is computationally tractable and requires no initialization. The paper also showcases the performance of the proposed technique on a wide range of simulated and real scenes. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
