The system uses stigmergic receptive fields (SRFs) to detect micro-behaviours in the raw signal and aggregates them into functional structures called trails. The SRFs are arranged in a stigmergic perceptron and are adaptive to subjects. The paper involves machine learning, signal processing, and human-computer interaction, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.HC, cs.LG, cs.CY, cs.SI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
