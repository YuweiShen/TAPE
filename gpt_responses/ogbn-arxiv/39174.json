Therefore, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category is the most likely fit, as the paper is primarily about developing a continuous integration system for machine learning models. \n\ncs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category is also highly relevant, as the paper discusses the importance of applying software engineering practices to machine learning development. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category is relevant because machine learning is a subfield of AI, and the paper discusses the challenges of applying AI techniques to continuous integration. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category is relevant because the paper discusses the use of machine learning models in real production systems, which often involve computer vision applications. \n\ncs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category is relevant because the paper introduces a domain specific language for specifying integration conditions, which is a programming language concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
