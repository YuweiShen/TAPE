The paper focuses on improving the stability and reducing overestimation errors in Q-learning, which are common issues in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the adaptive learning rate, which is a common topic in control systems and optimization, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on ATARI games, which is a common benchmark for deep reinforcement learning, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
