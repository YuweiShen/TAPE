This involves analyzing spatio-temporal data, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of this work is in the field of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of fusion using RGB and optical flow modalities, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
