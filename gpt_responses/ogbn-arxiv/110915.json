However, since the focus is on machine learning and wireless communication, cs.LG and cs.IT are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes and evaluates digital and over-the-air computing implementations, which further supports the inclusion of cs.IT and cs.NI. Finally, the use of heterogeneous data suggests a potential connection to cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
