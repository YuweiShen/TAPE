This topic is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including multi-agent systems (cs.MA), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG). Given the focus on emergent coordination algorithms and local sensing, cs.MA and cs.RO are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.SY, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
