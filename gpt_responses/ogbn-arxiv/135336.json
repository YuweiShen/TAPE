Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics and Automation) is the most likely category. The paper also mentions the need for innovative solutions, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The challenges in reducing integration time and costs could be related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and the need for a common hardware infrastructure could be related to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
