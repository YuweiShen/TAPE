The paper employs power-domain NOMA scheme in the uplink and studies the impact of backscattering reflection coefficients on the maximum network throughput. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also involves optimization techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of UAVs in the paper also suggests that it could belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
