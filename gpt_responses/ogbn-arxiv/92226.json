The paper presents new lower bounds and algorithms for this problem, which are likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields of computer science. Specifically, the paper involves techniques from learning theory (cs.LG), data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
