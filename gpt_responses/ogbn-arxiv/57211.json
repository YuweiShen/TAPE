Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper introduces a new metric for gauging the quality of spike recovery, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.SI (Statistical Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
