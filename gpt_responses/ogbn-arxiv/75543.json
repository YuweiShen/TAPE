This involves techniques such as N-Gram tiling and N-Gram splitting, which are commonly used in NLP and information retrieval (IR) research. The paper also discusses the background knowledge of labels alignments obtained from studied knowledge graphs, which relates to database (DB) and data management (DM) research. Overall, the paper covers topics that are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (AI), computational linguistics (CL), databases (DB), information retrieval (IR), and machine learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
