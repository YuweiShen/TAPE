The proposed method involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as perplexity prediction and semantic matching, which are sub-fields of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of external knowledge from a pre-trained object detection model and visual matching module also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG).
