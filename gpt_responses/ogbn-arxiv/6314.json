The paper also discusses the use of textual and meta features for this task, which are commonly used in NLP and IR. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of social user-generated data such as tweets, which falls under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and scholarly user-generated data such as academic articles, which falls under cs.CY (Computers and Society). Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of methods across these disparate domains, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves comparing the performance of different models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
