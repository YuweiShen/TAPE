Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses methods for reducing the encoding and decoding complexities of polar codes, which could fall under cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of analytical bounds and the discussion of computation complexity reduction suggest that the paper could also be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
