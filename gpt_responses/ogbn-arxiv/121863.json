The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised fine-tuning and hard examples, which are topics related to machine learning and deep learning, hence it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods, which is a technique used in computer graphics and computer vision, hence it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image retrieval, which is a sub-topic of information retrieval, hence it could also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
