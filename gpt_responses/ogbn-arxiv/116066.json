Based on the abstract and title, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper focuses on developing an approach to improve the learning speed and scalability of MARL in complex real-world problems. The use of reward functions and coordination among agents also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). The mention of decentralised coordination and scalability could also place the paper in the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
