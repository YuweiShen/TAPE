The paper also mentions the use of probability distributions and optimization, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for generating hash codes without weight tuning, which involves mathematical optimization and could be considered a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
