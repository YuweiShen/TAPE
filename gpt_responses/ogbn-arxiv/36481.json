The problem also has applications in cooperative communication schemes (cs.NI) and multimedia communication (cs.MM). The use of auxiliary random variables and optimization techniques suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
