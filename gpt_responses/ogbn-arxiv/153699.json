This involves estimating interference channels and incorporating interference from the primary system into CR precoding. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. However, since the focus is on interference mitigation in a wireless communication system, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
