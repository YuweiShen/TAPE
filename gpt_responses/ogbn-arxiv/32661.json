The paper also mentions transforming annotated C programs into C code suitable for testing, which is a topic related to programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses issues related to loops and contracts, which are topics related to logic and verification (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a software analysis platform (FRAMA-C), which is a topic related to software engineering and testing (cs.ET).
