It also involves knowledge distillation, which is a popular technique in machine learning. The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it experiments with various DNNs, and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with training algorithms. Neural networks are a type of computational model that falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which is a topic in the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
