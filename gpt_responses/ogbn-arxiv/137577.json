The paper also mentions the use of guessing exponent, which is a measure commonly used in cryptography (cs.CR) research. The paper extends previous coding schemes and proofs, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between secrecy and reliability, which is a topic relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
