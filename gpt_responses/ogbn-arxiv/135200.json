The paper proposes a method for handling missing elements in multimodal sequences using Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
