The paper focuses on improving the scalability of spectral clustering, which is a computational bottleneck for large-scale problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) since these fields often deal with large datasets and clustering problems. Additionally, the paper introduces a state-of-the-art SVD solver, which is a common technique in linear algebra and optimization, suggesting that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
