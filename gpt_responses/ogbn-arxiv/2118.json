The proposed approach also involves precoding techniques, which are commonly used in control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of simulation results, which suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
