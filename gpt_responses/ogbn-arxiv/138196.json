Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of information and communication. The paper also involves the design of transceiver architectures, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also deals with system-level optimization and performance evaluation, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves computer simulations, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also involves the design of beamforming filters, which falls under the category of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
