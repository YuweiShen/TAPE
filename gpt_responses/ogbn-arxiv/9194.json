The focus on analyzing citation keys suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The mention of networks formed by citations suggests a connection to social networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses biases in the citation process, which could be related to ethics and social aspects of computing (cs.CY).
