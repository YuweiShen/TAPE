The problem involves distributed computing and coordination, which are also relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition for solving the plane formation problem, which involves symmetry and geometry, and is related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and symmetry and group theory (cs.SY). Finally, the robots are endowed with visual perception, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
