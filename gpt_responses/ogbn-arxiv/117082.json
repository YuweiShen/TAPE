This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses modifications to the ResNet architecture to improve classification accuracy, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of spatially weighted pooling and localisation also suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
