The proposed method uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to process variable length keystroke data, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the usability aspect of the authentication method, as it continuously monitors the consistency of typing behavior after the login process, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the proposed method in cybercrime investigations, which could be classified under the category of cybercrime (cs.CY) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
