These modules are aimed at exploiting the temporal information of video sequences and tackling the poor spatial alignment of moving pedestrians. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed framework involves deep learning techniques, such as bi-directional LSTM, and leverages high-level semantic information, indicating that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also involves feature extraction and representation, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
