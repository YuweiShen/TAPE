The focus is on processing business card images captured with a cell-phone camera, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and data storage (cs.DS) categories. The paper also mentions the computational efficiency and low memory consumption of the developed technique, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) applications on mobile devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
