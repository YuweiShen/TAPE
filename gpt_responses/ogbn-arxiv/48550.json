Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of logic and algorithms, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper's focus on robustness and the use of abstraction techniques suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
