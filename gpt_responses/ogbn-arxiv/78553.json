The paper also includes a comparison of bit error rate and diversity order, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of multiple emitters and a single receiver is a system-level design choice, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the impact of fading on the system performance, which is a topic related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper includes a proof-of-concept experiment, which involves the implementation of a system, falling under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
