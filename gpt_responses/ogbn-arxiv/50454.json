This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of sorting algorithms, which falls under algorithms (cs.AL) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper provides experimental results, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
