The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (cs.AI) and the extraction of semantic concepts (cs.CL) from the coin images. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of real-world multimodal input (cs.MM) and the need for information retrieval (cs.IR) to associate semantic concepts with the correct coin images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
