The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the usefulness of tangent images for traditional computer vision tasks like structure-from-motion and SLAM, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
