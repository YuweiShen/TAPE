The use of novelty search as an alternative to traditional fitness-based evolution is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The study also involves the coordination and behavior of multiple robots, which relates to the field of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the performance and effectiveness of different evolutionary algorithms, which is a common topic in the field of machine learning and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
