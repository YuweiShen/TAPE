The paper also discusses compression techniques and numerical representation for weights, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of bit-shift operations for efficient inference is related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper also mentions fine-grained pruning, which is a technique for reducing model sizes and can be considered as a data structure (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
