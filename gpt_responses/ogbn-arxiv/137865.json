The use of millimeter wave spectrum and analog front-end design also relates to the field of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different beamforming techniques in the presence of quantization noise, which is a topic studied in the field of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
