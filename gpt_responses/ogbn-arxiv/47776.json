The paper proposes an approach that doesn't require training a specialized NMT model on parallel document-level corpora, but instead self-trains a trained sentence-level NMT model on pairs of source sentences and generated translations. This approach falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category, as it covers NLP and machine translation. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories, as they cover ML and NLP. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another possible category, as it covers neural networks and deep learning, which are used in NMT. Finally, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is a less likely category, but it covers image and video processing, which could be relevant for some document-level NMT tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
