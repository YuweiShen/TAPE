This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it deals with improving the performance of GNNs. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of self-training, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework also involves graph embeddings, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses hyper-parameter tuning, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
