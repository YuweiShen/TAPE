The paper proposes a new problem of robust influence maximization, which aims to maximize the worst-case ratio between the influence spread of the chosen seed set and the optimal seed set, given the uncertainty of the parameter input. This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including social network analysis (cs.SOC), data science (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses sampling methods to reduce uncertainty on parameters, which is relevant to the sub-field of social network sampling (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
