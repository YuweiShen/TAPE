The use of deep learning also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The mention of probabilistic graphical modelling could also place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the use of residual learning and the proposed CRU-Net architecture could suggest it belongs to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of evaluations and achieving the best performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies could suggest it belongs to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
