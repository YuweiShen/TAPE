The problem is formulated as a DCOP, which is a common framework for multi-agent coordination and optimization problems (cs.DC). The authors propose a decentralized algorithm that uses message passing among agents, which is a common approach in multi-agent systems and distributed computing (cs.SY). The problem involves uncertain task rewards, which requires modeling and reasoning under uncertainty, a topic that is often studied in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the authors propose a regret-based approach to minimize the overall worst-case loss, which is a concept commonly used in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
