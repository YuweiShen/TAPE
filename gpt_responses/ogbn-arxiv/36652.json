The paper uses algebraic techniques to prove that certain constraint languages make Max CSP have a hard gap at location 1, which implies that such problems cannot have a PTAS unless P = NP. This result is of interest to researchers in computational complexity theory (cs.CC), algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
