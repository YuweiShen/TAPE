The paper also introduces several innovations to improve the performance and efficiency of the framework, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MM, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
