The strategy involves generating a user interface model, which can be considered a programming language (cs.PL) for the mobile app. The paper also discusses the use of a crawling technique to explore the dynamic behavior of the app, which falls under the software development (cs.SD) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of ensuring acceptable quality and meeting specifications, which falls under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category. Finally, the paper uses experimental evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which falls under the machine learning (cs.MA) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
