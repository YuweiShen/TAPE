The paper develops a risk minimization framework for performative prediction, bringing together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cybersecurity (cs.CY), cryptography (cs.CR), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
