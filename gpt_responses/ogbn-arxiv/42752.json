This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the practical constraints of limited transmit power, limited front/backhaul capacity, and limited pilot resource, which are relevant to system design and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves the use of signal processing techniques such as maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF), which are relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
