This paper is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it proposes a new architecture for RNNs. It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses training techniques to optimize the accuracy and speed of delta networks. Additionally, it may belong to the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category as it applies delta networks to speech recognition benchmarks. It may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category as it applies delta networks to an end-to-end CNN for steering angle prediction. Finally, it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SD) sub-category as it discusses the optimization of RNN computation for driving datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
