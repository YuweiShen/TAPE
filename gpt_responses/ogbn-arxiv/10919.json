The authors also develop an analytical model for the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The proposed system involves the use of a novel biological interface for molecular communication, which can be seen as an emerging technology. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not directly related to multimedia, the paper involves the use of a light-emitting diode (LED) to control the optical signal, which can be seen as a form of multimedia technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
