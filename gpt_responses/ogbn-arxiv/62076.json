Additionally, the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it proposes an efficient and general object detection framework. The use of deep learning techniques also suggests that the paper may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as object detection and localization are important tasks in robotics applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
