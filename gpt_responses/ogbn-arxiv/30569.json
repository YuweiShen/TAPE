The approach presented in the paper involves converting conformant problems into classical ones, which could also fall under the category of logic (cs.LG). The use of heuristics and scaling up also suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
