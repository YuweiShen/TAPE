The paper also discusses the limitations of existing interpretation methods and proposes a fine-tuning approach, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper's discussion of adversarial examples and confidence calibration suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions heatmap visualization, which is a common technique in computer vision, indicating a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's focus on neural models and their behaviors suggests a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
