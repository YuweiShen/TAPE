This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new engine for producing prediction-local explanations, which involves cluster analysis and indices to measure the influence of input features on the final prediction. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of algorithm transparency and human understandability, which suggests that it may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
