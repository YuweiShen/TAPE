The construction is based on representation theory, which is also relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also presents an explicit algorithm, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the use of dictionaries for sparsity is a topic that is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
