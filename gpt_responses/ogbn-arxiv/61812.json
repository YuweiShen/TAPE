The paper proposes a novel neural architecture for end-to-end relation extraction that utilizes metric-based features, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG). The architecture also involves 2D convolutions, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE).
