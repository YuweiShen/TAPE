The use of CNNs also involves learning high-level concepts from spatial data, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed system, which could be related to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
