This involves designing a new network block, UniDual, which is used for both images and videos. The experiments are conducted on Kinetics and ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
