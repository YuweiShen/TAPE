The paper also uses language models for pronoun resolution, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper compares its approach to previous state-of-the-art methods, which involves experimentation and evaluation, indicating a possible fit for the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of diverse and challenging coreference resolution problems, which may involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for image-based coreference resolution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
