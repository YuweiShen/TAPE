This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper formulates an optimization problem to solve it. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel mobile relaying technique to improve communication performance, which is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture. The paper also discusses dynamic rate and power allocations at the source and relay, which are important aspects of network design. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper studies the problem of optimizing the performance of a mobile relaying system, which involves controlling the rate and power allocations at the source and relay. This is a topic of interest in systems and control, and the paper formulates an optimization problem to solve it. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mobile relaying to improve communication performance, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high bandwidth and low latency. The paper also discusses the use of dynamic rate and power allocations, which are important for multimedia streaming. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography or security, but the use of mobile relaying may have implications for security and privacy in wireless networks.
