The paper proposes two variational convex hull models using level set representation for 2-dimensional data, which is a common approach in computer vision. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): Convex hull algorithms are commonly used in computer graphics for various tasks such as collision detection, path planning, and shape analysis. The paper proposes two variational convex hull models that can be applied to 2-dimensional data, which is relevant to the graphics community. \n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Convex hull algorithms are a fundamental problem in computational geometry. The paper proposes two variational convex hull models that can be used to find the convex hull of one or multiple objects, which is relevant to the computational geometry community. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes efficient numerical schemes using alternating direction method of multipliers for the solution of the proposed models. This is relevant to the numerical analysis community. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a model that penalizes the distance from each given point to the zero sublevel-set, which can be seen as a control problem. This is relevant to the systems and control community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
