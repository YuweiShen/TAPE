The paper also involves deep learning techniques and modeling inter-dependency among objects, which are common themes in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with generating structured descriptions of images.
