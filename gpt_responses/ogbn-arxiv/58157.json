The paper focuses on the intrinsic calculus syntax and semantics, which deals with the basic structural aspects of programming languages. The paper also discusses the extrinsic operations and associated rewrite rules. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Theoretical Computer Science (cs.THEORY), Language and Computation (cs.LG), and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
