It also involves database (DB) management and querying, as well as machine learning (LG) for identifying patterns and making predictions. The paper proposes a new fragment for OWL, which involves software engineering (SE) and system design. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of this new fragment, which involves systems integration (SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
