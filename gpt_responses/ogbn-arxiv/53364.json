The paper discusses algorithmic aspects and provides two example applications, interference management and cooperative spectrum sensing. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.GT (Computer Science - Game Theory and Decision Science), followed by cs.NI (Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.IT (Computer Science - Information Theory), cs.SI (Computer Science - Social and Information Networks), and cs.MA (Computer Science - Multiagent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
