The use of locally repairable codes (LRCs) is a specific technique for achieving fault tolerance in distributed storage systems, which could be classified under distributed systems (cs.DS) or distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the trade-off between minimum distance and locality, which could be considered a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the explicit constructions of LRCs involve combinatorial designs, which could be classified under discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or applied combinatorics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
