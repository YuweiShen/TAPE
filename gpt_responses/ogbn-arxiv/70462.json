Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions lambda-calculi, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages). Additionally, the paper discusses algebraic lambda-calculi, which is related to cs.LT (Automata and Formal Languages). The paper also deals with non-determinism, which is a topic in cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
