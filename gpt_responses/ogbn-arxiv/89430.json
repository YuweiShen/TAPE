This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.DL). The use of algorithms for field of interest prediction also involves information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the evaluation of the proposed methods on a novel dataset of canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (CMCT) and a publicly available human mamma carcinoma (HMC) dataset involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with digital images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
