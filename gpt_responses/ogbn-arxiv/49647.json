This suggests that the paper could belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) or Social and Behavioral Sciences (cs.SOC) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents a statistical method to identify Simpson's paradox, which involves analyzing and comparing trends in aggregate data and disaggregated subgroups.
