Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with cooperative Markov games, which falls under the category of multiagent systems (MA) and game theory (GT), making cs.MA and cs.GT likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper involves the use of reinforcement learning in a cooperative setting, which can be seen as a control problem in a complex system, making cs.SY a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
