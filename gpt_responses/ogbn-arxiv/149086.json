The approach also involves generative replay and open set recognition, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
