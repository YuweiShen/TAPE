The use of a Perspective-n-Points (PnP) solver suggests that the paper may also fall under robotics (cs.RO) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the development of an end-to-end trainable pipeline for object pose estimation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
