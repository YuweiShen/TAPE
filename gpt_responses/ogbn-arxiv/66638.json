The paper proposes an optimal multicast algorithm for hybrid RF/FSO networks, which involves solving the minimum weight set cover problem. This problem is related to network optimization and algorithms, which are sub-categories of computer science. Specifically, the paper deals with networking (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), cryptography and security (cs.CR), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
