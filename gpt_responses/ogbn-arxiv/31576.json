The use of Lyapunov-like functions suggests a focus on control theory and dynamical systems, which are also relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also proposes a switching strategy for feedback control policies, which is a common technique in the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category. The use of decision making and optimization techniques for goal assignment suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
