The study of subfield subcodes and their properties involves algebraic and combinatorial aspects, which are relevant to the subfields of discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of LRC codes in distributed storage systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
