This involves storing merged CSs in a relational table, which is a common approach in database systems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of characteristic sets in indexing RDF data is a recent development in AI research, as it can capture the implicit schema of the data and improve query performance. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper addresses the problem of schema heterogeneity in RDF datasets, which can affect the performance of SPARQL queries. The proposed technique aims to reduce the number of CSs and links between them, which can improve query efficiency. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a novel technique for merging characteristic sets based on their hierarchical structure, which involves identifying dense CSs and merging them with their ancestors. This requires efficient data structures and algorithms for processing and organizing the CSs. \n- cs.DL (Digital Libraries): RDF is a common format for representing metadata in digital libraries, and SPARQL is a standard query language for RDF data. The proposed technique can improve the efficiency of SPARQL queries in heterogeneous RDF datasets, which can benefit digital library applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
