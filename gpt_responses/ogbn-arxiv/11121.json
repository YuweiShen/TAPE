This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification tasks (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The bandit strategy used in the proposed method is related to reinforcement learning and decision making (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
