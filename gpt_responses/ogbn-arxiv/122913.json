The use of marker lists and POS labeling suggests a focus on computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the evaluation of the segmentation models against a manually annotated corpus involves the use of metrics and statistical analysis, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
