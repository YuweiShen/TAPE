The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of saliency models, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The eye-tracking experiments conducted in the study involve human perception and cognition, which could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
