This involves the use of independent and identically distributed Gaussian signals to hinder the eavesdropper. Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their capacity, and this paper proposes a method for increasing the capacity of a wireless security system. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a method for increasing the security of wireless communication systems by using opportunistic jammer selection. The focus is on preventing eavesdropping by an attacker (Eve) and ensuring that the legitimate receiver (Bob) can receive the transmitted signal securely. This is a key concern in the field of cryptography and security. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a method for improving the performance of wireless communication systems by using opportunistic jammer selection. This involves selecting jammers whose jamming channels are aligned at Bob, but not at Eve, to increase the secure DoF. Networking and internet architecture are closely related to the study of communication systems and their performance. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for controlling the performance of wireless communication systems by using opportunistic jammer selection. This involves selecting jammers"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
