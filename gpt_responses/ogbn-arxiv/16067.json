Given that the paper focuses on deep learning algorithms and their convergence properties, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LG, followed by cs.AI and cs.CV. The use of game-theoretic concepts and the proposal of a new approach to adaptive model selection also suggest a possible classification under cs.GT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
