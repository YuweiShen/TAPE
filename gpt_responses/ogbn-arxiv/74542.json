The most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) since the paper focuses on grounding natural-language semantics in robotic driving. The second likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) since the paper involves automated driving to accomplish navigational goals specified in natural language. The third likely category is cs.RO (Robotics) since the paper involves robotic driving. The fourth likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) since the paper involves acquisition and generation of meanings from human annotation. The fifth likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision) since the paper involves generating sentential descriptions of new robotic driving paths."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
