Additionally, the paper mentions the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning techniques such as evolution to create these controllers. The study of the sensitivity and robustness of the controllers also falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of evolution to create these controllers also falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
