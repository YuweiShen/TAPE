This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs and fine-tuning, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The problem of labelling high-resolution aerial imagery involves geometric reasoning and spatial analysis, which are relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
