The problem involves finding a minimum radius to cover certain points, which could also fall under the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category. The paper also mentions a connection to a matching problem in graphs, which could indicate a possible fit in the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-category.
