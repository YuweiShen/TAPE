The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem and proposes approximation and exact algorithms, which are topics in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions the size of the literal decoder, which is related to the length of the code and could be considered a topic in formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the related problems of finding a shortest mortal and a shortest avoiding word, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
