Specifically, the paper focuses on contraction coefficients, which are important for understanding the behavior of these divergences under data processing. This topic is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory and probability (cs.ITP), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
