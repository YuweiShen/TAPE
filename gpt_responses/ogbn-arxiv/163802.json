This topic falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO) categories. The paper also proposes a novel, conflict-aware, composable, truly concurrent semantics, which involves analyzing the control-flow and data-flow choices/conflicts present in real-world programs. This could potentially fall under the categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR), architecture (cs.AR), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
