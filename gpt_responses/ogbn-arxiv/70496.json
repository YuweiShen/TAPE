This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) detectors, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides guidelines for the design of low complexity multistage detectors, which falls under the category of computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
