This involves approximating Kolmogorov complexity via the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The paper also presents experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data, which are common in machine learning research. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the Kolmogorov complexity and Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which are concepts from information theory. The paper also proposes a method for approximating Kolmogorov complexity using MDL, which is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for causal inference, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence research. The paper also presents experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data, which are common in AI research. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the algorithmic Markov condition, which is a concept from graph theory and probability theory.
