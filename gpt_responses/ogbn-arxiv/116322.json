The paper proposes a multi-agent approach to NAS, which involves coordination between agents to reach optimal architectures. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses image datasets and network configurations, indicating a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses theoretical results related to regret, which suggests a possible connection to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
