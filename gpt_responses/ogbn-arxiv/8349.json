The use of a gradient-based importance measure and analysis of training images also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The analysis of diversity in training examples could also place it in the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
