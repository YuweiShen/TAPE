This approach has potential applications in distribution-aware model sampling and probabilistic logic programming. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also introduces an enhancement of the state-of-the-art CDNL/CDCL algorithm for SAT/ASP solving, which falls under the sub-category cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also reports on the open-source software DelSAT, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
