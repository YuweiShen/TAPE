It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a common task in this field. The use of optimization-based methods such as determinantal point processes (DPPs) suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the mention of a similarity measure inspired by capsule networks suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as capsule networks are commonly used in image recognition tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
