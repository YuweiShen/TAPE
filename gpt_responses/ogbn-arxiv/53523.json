Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of this work on safety in urban autonomous driving, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The proposed method involves joint supervision on semantic segmentation and pedestrian detection, which could be considered a machine learning approach (cs.LG) and involves the use of neural networks, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of execution time and robustness to occlusion, which could be considered a security and privacy concern (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
