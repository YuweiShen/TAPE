This falls under the scope of cs.DS.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper proves that the problem of approximating chromatic number is NP-hard, which is a central topic in computational complexity theory. Hence, cs.CC is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper involves the study of graphs and their coloring, which is a topic that has connections to computational geometry. Hence, cs.CG is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.GT (Graph Theory) - The paper deals with the chromatic number of graphs, which is a central topic in graph theory.
