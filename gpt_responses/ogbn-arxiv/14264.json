Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as cosine similarity and correlation score, which are commonly used in computational linguistics (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of weighting models and analysis of varying parameters also suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves the use of web knowledge, which could be related to web science (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
