Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper also considers power consumption and optimization, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
