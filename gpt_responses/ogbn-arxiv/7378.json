This falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The technique involves knowledge distillation, which is a popular method in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of applying this technique to ranking problems, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques.
