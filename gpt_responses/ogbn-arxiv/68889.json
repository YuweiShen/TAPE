The paper also introduces a regression framework to explain the model features, which involves machine learning techniques such as linear regression (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed methods on real-world data sets, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SI) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
