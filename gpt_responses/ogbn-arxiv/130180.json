Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also considers physical and hardware limitations, which are related to systems and control (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the design of optimal waveforms and beamforming vectors, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
