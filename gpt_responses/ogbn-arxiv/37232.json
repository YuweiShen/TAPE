Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the development of a foundation for programming with higher-order abstract syntax, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and formal languages (cs.FL). The paper also introduces a decidable bi-directional type system, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
