Specifically, the paper proposes a new benchmark for continual reinforcement learning and introduces a model-free strategy for the same. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses ViZDoom, a popular platform for developing AI agents for first-person shooter games, which suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also deals with a 3D environment, which suggests that it may belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
