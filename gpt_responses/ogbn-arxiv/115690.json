The paper also mentions the use of surface representations and density-based approaches, which are commonly used in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Graphics (cs.GR) research. The paper proposes a novel approach for Next Best View (NBV) planning, which involves decision-making and optimization, indicating a possible connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which suggests a possible connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
