As such, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Computer Science related to Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely categories as the paper deals with a specific application of machine learning (CNNs) in computer vision tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
