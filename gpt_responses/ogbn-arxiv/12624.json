It could also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category as detecting heavy hitters can aid in DoS detection. Additionally, the use of hash tables and memory constraints suggest that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm using packet traces from an ISP backbone link and a data center suggests that it could also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) category. Finally, the use of programmable data planes suggests that it could belong to the Performance (cs.PF) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
