The paper specifically focuses on variance-reduced algorithms, which are commonly used in optimization, and discusses improvements to existing algorithms. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Numerical Analysis\" (cs.NA) and \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper addresses issues related to practical implementation, which could make it relevant to the sub-categories of \"Other Computer Science\" (cs.OH) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
