The proposed receiver takes into account the effect of non-white noise, which is a characteristic of colored noise, and models it as an autoregressive (AR) process, which is a topic related to networked systems and control (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a new mechanism for exchange of information between the equalizer and the channel decoder, which is a topic related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to show the performance of the proposed receiver, which is a topic related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
