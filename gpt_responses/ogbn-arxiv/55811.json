The proposed approach uses deep learning methods, specifically deep neural networks (cs.CV), and graph regularization (cs.LG) to improve classification accuracy. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms is also mentioned (cs.AI), and the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as confidence trees (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
