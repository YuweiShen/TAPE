The use of sketching and pseudo-random generators suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The optimization of space complexity and the use of independence in the algorithm may also make the paper relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
