Additionally, the paper mentions the use of SVMs and Mondrian Forests, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of semantic descriptors, which could potentially fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category.
