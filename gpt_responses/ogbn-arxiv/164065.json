The paper also discusses the need to choose crowd questions that minimize uncertainty, which is a problem that is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper mentions the need to derive estimates of correct values, which is a task that involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of structural constraints, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning and data mining (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with uncertainty and estimation, which are topics that are relevant to statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
