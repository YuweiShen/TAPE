The paper also covers automatic solvers for geometric problems that require the understanding of diagrams, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different techniques on publicly accessible datasets, which falls under data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
