It also mentions the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and kernel SVMs (cs.AI) for training. The mention of non-linear representations suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses parallelization, which could fall under distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
