The use of web crawled videos for weakly supervised learning suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques to retrieve relevant videos, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. The use of machine learning techniques to learn from weakly supervised data suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques to retrieve relevant videos, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
