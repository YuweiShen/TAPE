Information theory is a relevant sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with distributed systems and their vulnerabilities to attacks. This is a relevant topic in systems and control. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the impact of eavesdropping on communication in distributed systems, which is a relevant topic in networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the impact of eavesdropping on distributed inference, which involves processing of multimedia data.
