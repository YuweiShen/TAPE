The paper specifically focuses on image classification benchmarks, which falls under the computer vision sub-category. The use of active learning methods and ensembles also suggests a potential fit for the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.CL) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
