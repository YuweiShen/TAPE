The paper also proposes a novel adaptive version of the scheme, which is evaluated on several benchmark datasets. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed scheme and proposes a solution to address the issue, which falls under the category of regularization techniques in machine learning. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
