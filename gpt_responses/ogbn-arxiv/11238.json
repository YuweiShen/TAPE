Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication systems. The paper also proposes a construction of subcodes and compares their performance with other types of polar codes, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of generalized cosets and polarizing matrices suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory, which could place the paper under cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
