This involves optimizing the allocation of coded bits from the FEC encoder to the modulation bits of the signal constellation. The paper also discusses the performance of different SC code classes, including protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and generalized LDPC codes, and their decoding methods. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.COMM (Communication and Networking), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
