The paper specifically focuses on sentence segmentation in narrative transcripts from neuropsychological tests. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also uses neural networks, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with speech impairments, which could make cs.SD (Sound) a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper uses recurrent neural networks, which could make cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
