The use of descriptors to determine scaling weights also suggests a computer vision approach. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): Pose estimation is a common problem in robotics, and the paper proposes a method for solving it without correspondences. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of descriptors to determine scaling weights could be seen as a machine learning approach. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for solving a common problem in computer vision and robotics, which could be seen as an artificial intelligence approach. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): Point set registration is also a common problem in computer graphics, and the paper's proposed method could be applicable in that field as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
