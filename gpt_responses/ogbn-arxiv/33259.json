This suggests that it belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses feedback schemes, scheduling, and diversity, which are all relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also deals with signal processing techniques such as transmit antenna selection, space-time block codes, and cyclic delay diversity, which are relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of reduced feedback, which is relevant to the Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
