Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses neural network approaches, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI and cs.LG). The paper also deals with feature design, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for creating distant supervision labels, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
