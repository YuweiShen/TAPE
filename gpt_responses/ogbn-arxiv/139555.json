The paper also discusses the properties of the proposed mechanisms, such as continuing contribution incentive and unprofitable sybil attack, which are related to game theory concepts. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the issue of incentivizing participants in crowdsourcing, which is a topic related to the social impact of computing. The paper also discusses the ethical implications of the proposed mechanisms, such as unprofitable solicitor bypassing. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with crowdsourcing, which involves the interaction between multiple users. The paper proposes incentive mechanisms that incentivize both direct contributions and solicitations to other users, which can be viewed as a network of incentives. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes three types of incentive mechanisms, which involve the design of data structures and algorithms to distribute the payouts to the participants. The paper also discusses the theoretical analysis of the mechanisms, which involves the analysis of the complexity and efficiency of the algorithms. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the properties of the proposed mechanisms, such as continuing solicitation incentive and value proportional to contribution, which are related to the user experience"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
