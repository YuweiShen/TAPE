It may also belong to cs.SD (Sound) as it mentions the front-end processing of Mandarin Chinese text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the paper uses neural networks for prediction, which suggests it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of embeddings and lookup tables suggests it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
