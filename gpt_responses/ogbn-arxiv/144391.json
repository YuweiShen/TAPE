This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes algorithms for mitigating interference in MU-MIMO systems, which could also place it in the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of bit error rate (BER), which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
