Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as FL is a subfield of machine learning. The paper also addresses the issue of label quality disparity in FL, which is related to data quality and data privacy. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are also likely sub-categories. The paper proposes a method for quantifying the credibility of client local data without directly observing them, which involves computing mutual cross-entropy and credit weighted orchestration. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
