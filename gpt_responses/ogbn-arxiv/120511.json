Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of different coding schemes and power levels, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of nested lattice codes, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of rate splitting and time-division multiplexing, which are techniques used in communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper mentions the sum-rate performance, which is a topic in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
