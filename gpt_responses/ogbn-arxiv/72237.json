The paper also proposes a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process Model (POMDP) to handle uncertainties in the environment, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also considers human behavior and perception, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper uses sensor fusion and filtering techniques to detect and track people, which is a common approach in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with navigation planning in a shared environment, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
