The method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC) is a general approach to optimize nested functions, which is relevant to optimization (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also describes ParMAC, a distributed-computation model for MAC, which involves parallel computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper applies ParMAC to learn binary autoencoders for fast image retrieval, which is a specific application of computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
