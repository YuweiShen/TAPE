This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Numerical Analysis sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method, which is a popular optimization algorithm in machine learning. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The Kaczmarz algorithm is a well-known algorithm for solving linear systems, which is a fundamental problem in computer science. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, but the Kaczmarz algorithm has been used in network tomography and other network-related applications. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Social and Information Networks sub-category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes new methods to improve the convergence speed of the Kaczmarz algorithm, which is an optimization problem.
