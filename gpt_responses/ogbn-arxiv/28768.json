This is a fundamental concept in information theory, which suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under this sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new loss function for training neural decoders, which is a machine learning technique. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on various block codes, which further supports the categorization under this sub-category.\n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a new loss function for neural decoders, which is a neural computing technique. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on various block codes, which further supports the categorization under this sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new method for online adaptation to changing channel conditions, which is a control system problem. The proposed method does not depend on knowledge of the transmitted codeword, making it a promising tool for online adaptation to changing channel conditions, which further supports the categorization under this sub-category.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a new method for error-correcting decoders, which is a security problem.
