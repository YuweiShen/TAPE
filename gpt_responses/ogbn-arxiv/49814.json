The use of neural networks also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the organization of face space and the perception of caricatures, which could relate to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
