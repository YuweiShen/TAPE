Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves learning and selecting discriminative parts, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The optimization techniques used in the paper, such as ADMM, could also place it in cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
