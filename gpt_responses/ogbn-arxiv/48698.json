The paper proposes a new method called Stochastic Negative Mining, which is a practical implementation of a family of surrogate losses. This method is applicable to a wide range of applications in computer science, including natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also provides generalization error bounds, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.IR, cs.CL, cs.CV, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
