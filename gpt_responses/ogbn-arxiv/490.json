The use of statistical models and electromagnetic simulations also suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of beamforming techniques to address blockage, which falls under the category of computer architecture and embedded systems (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
