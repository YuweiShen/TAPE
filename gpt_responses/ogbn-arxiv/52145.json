The proposed attack involves using a compromised air-conditioning system to send commands to infected hosts within the air-gapped network, which requires knowledge of networking and communication protocols (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the development of a novel line-encoding and protocol for thermal communication, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The attack involves controlling the air-conditioning system, which is a cyber-physical system, and therefore falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Lastly, the paper discusses ways to detect and prevent the proposed attack, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
