The use of a prediction module and resource allocation framework also suggests that it may fall under the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories, which deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of human annotation efforts, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.HC sub-category, which deals with human-computer interaction.
