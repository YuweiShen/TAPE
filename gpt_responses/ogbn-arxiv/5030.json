It also mentions that the existing learning methods suffer from poor performance or low computation efficiency under such a scenario, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the proposed framework involves generating a strong ensemble, which is a common technique in AI. \n\nThe paper also mentions class overlapping, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). \n\nFinally, the proposed framework involves boosting the performance of existing learning methods, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
