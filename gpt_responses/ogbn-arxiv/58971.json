Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses reducing the demand for labeled data, which suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a computational taxonomic map, which implies a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions semantic tasks, which suggests a connection to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper discusses tools for computing and probing the taxonomical structure, which suggests a connection to cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
