The use of LTI filters and AWGN channels suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the networked control systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The numerical example and simulations indicate that the paper may involve some computational aspects, which could place it in the machine learning (cs.MA) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
