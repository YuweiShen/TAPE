This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the transferability of the CNN model to different MRI scanners and protocols, which involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves image analysis and processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
