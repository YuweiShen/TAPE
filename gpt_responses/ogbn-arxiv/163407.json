The paper also evaluates the use of linear SVM and CNN, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a larger dataset and probabilistic occlusion masking suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper deals with biometrics and image recognition, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
