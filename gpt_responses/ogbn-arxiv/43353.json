The use of individual profiles and the conformation process suggest a focus on social influence and opinion dynamics, which are also relevant to the sub-field of social computing (cs.SI). Finally, the technical aspects of the paper, such as the complexity analysis and algorithm design, are related to the sub-field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
