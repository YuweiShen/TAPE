Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. The paper also involves wireless communication and networking, which suggests the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of multiple antennas and signal processing techniques also suggests the categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
