Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for pattern discovery, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. The paper also mentions the usefulness of the algorithm's output for computational social science, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper's focus on scalability and unsupervised bootstrapping could also make it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
