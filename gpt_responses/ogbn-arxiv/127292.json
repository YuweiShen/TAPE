The paper also discusses the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their limitations, which could fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper focuses on the development of small-footprint models, which could fall under the sub-category of system and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
