The paper also discusses the use of real sensor data and noise, which could potentially fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of deep learning networks and loss functions for training the model could also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of optically zoomed images to obtain ground truth data, which could potentially fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of computational zoom, which could potentially fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
