Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses network conditions and video content, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper proposes strategies for switching methods, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SI (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions video complexity, which could relate to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
