The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analog signal separation and provides general achievability bounds for the compression rate. These topics are closely related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the separation of audio or video signals, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper introduces new probabilistic uncertainty relations, which are relevant to the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
