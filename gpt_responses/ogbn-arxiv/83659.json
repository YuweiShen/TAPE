The use of cascaded precoding and parametric models also suggests a focus on signal processing and optimization, which are common in the cs.IT and cs.SY sub-categories. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.SY are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.NI, cs.MM, and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
