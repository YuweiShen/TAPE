This makes cs.CR the most likely category.\n- cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing): The paper deals with the processing of speech signals and body-surface vibrations, which are related to sound and music. This category is also likely.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the use of voice assistants as a user interface and proposes a system that fits in wearable devices. This makes cs.HC a possible category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions the trend of wearables, smart vehicles, and home automation systems, which are related to social and information networks. This category is also possible.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the security and privacy implications of voice assistants, which are related to the societal impact of technology.
