This makes it likely to also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. \n\nThe paper also introduces a new learning formulation, which involves the use of statistical ensembles. This makes it likely to belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) category, which deals with computer graphics and visualization. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of instance normalization, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia applications.
