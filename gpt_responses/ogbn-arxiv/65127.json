The paper also discusses the use of digital and analog coding schemes, which are commonly used in multimedia communication (cs.MM). The paper also considers the case when the source and interference are correlated, which is a problem in statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed schemes to cognitive radio channels, which is a problem in networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes new coding schemes and analyzes their performance, which is a problem in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
