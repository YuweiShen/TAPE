The paper also draws on algebraic and topological techniques to characterize the borderline between hardness and tractability for a certain class of infinite domain CSPs, which suggests that it may be relevant to the areas of computational complexity (cs.CC), graph theory (cs.GT), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
