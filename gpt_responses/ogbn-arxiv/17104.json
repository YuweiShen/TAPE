The paper proposes a novel approach for enforcing structural layout relationships among landmarks using multiple stacked layout-graph reasoning layers, which involves reasoning over structural graph nodes to achieve global layout coherency. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) due to the visual nature of the fashion landmark detection task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
