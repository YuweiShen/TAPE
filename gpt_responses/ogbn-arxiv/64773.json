This work involves human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which are relevant to the cs.HC sub-category. The use of multi-view and multi-task learning methods for improving model performance is a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also involves the analysis of real-world driving experiences, which may fall under the cs.CY sub-category. The use of physiological signals for affective state detection may involve computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
