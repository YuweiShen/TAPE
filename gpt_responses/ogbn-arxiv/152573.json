The paper also discusses algorithms based on the UCB and KLUCB frameworks, which are commonly used in the field of multi-armed bandits (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper proposes a Poissonization argument that may be of independent interest in other settings, which suggests a connection to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of delayed conversions, which may involve statistical modeling and analysis (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
