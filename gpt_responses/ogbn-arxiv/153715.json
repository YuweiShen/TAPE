Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised learning and sparse representations, which are topics commonly studied in machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with image classification, which is a common application of information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible category.
