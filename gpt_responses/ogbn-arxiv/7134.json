Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a new optimization problem to minimize the long-term remote estimation mean squared error, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with linear time-invariant dynamic systems, which falls under cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
