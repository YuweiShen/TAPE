This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.HC: The paper also discusses the limitations of human agents in analyzing unstructured data and proposes a hybrid platform that can integrate human computing resources. This falls under the scope of human-computer interaction.\n- cs.LG: The paper discusses the need for human-like intelligence in machine algorithms for analysis of unstructured data, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.IR: The paper discusses the analysis of unstructured data, which is a common task in information retrieval.\n- cs.DS: The paper proposes a platform for managing complex tasks that can be decomposed into a dependency graph, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
