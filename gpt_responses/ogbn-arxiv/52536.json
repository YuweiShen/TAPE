The proposed concept of event-triggered learning also involves adapting to changing dynamics, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper uses statistical analysis and concentration inequalities, which are techniques commonly used in the field of neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
