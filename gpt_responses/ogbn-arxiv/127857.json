This involves the use of Markov Decision Process (MDP) and channel state information (CSI) as well as queue state information (QSI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
