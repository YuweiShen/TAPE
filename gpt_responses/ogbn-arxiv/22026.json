The paper also compares its system with state of the art automation algorithms for assembly tasks.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper leverages commercial virtual reality technology to create a virtual reality control room for the user to control the robot. This involves designing an interface that is intuitive and easy to use, which falls under the domain of human-computer interaction.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper uses a commercial gaming engine to run the virtual reality system, which involves graphics rendering and display.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the integration of the virtual reality system with existing robotics control software, which involves designing a control system for the overall telerobotic system.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses virtual reality hardware and software to create a multimedia experience for the user to control the robot."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
