This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning and feature extraction also suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a likely sub-category. The application of the method to video data indicates multimedia (cs.MM) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the use of infrared data suggests the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR) as a potential fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
