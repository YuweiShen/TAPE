The method incorporates additional knowledge and is designed to scale up to many tasks under a high-dimensional situation. Therefore, it is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
