The system is specifically designed for industrial automatic and robotic systems, which suggests the involvement of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also involves measuring the operator's status and adapting the interaction accordingly, which suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of ensuring the security and safety of the system, which suggests the involvement of cybersecurity (cs.CYBER)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
