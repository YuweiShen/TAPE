The paper proposes modifications to existing local methods to improve scalability and robustness, which are important issues in computer science. The paper also uses pre-processing techniques and graph diffusions, which are common methods in machine learning and data mining. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
