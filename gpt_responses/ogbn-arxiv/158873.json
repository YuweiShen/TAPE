This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless sensor networks and their limitations in monitoring physical events. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of sensor networks for monitoring physical events, which can be seen as a type of social network. Additionally, the paper proposes a framework for data aggregation, which can be seen as a type of information network.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques such as matrix completion and compressed sensing to recover incomplete sensory data.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a framework for monitoring physical events using wireless sensor networks, which can be seen as a type of control system.
