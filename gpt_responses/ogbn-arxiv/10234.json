The paper also introduces and investigates a range of general notions of a game, which could place it in the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses modeling partial and erroneous information, which could suggest it belongs to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the connection to logic and computation formalisms, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the recently introduced Turing-complete logic based on game-theoretic semantics, which could suggest it belongs to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
