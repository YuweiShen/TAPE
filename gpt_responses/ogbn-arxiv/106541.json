This involves decomposing a policy into a low-dimensional space of action representations and a component that transforms these representations into actual actions. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
