This falls under the purview of information theory, which deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with the processing of signals received by the radar, which involves the detection of targets and the cancellation of noise. This falls under the purview of signal processing, which deals with the analysis, manipulation, and interpretation of signals. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the performance analysis of a system for radar detection, which involves the transmission, reception, and processing of signals. This falls under the purview of systems and control, which deals with the analysis, design, and optimization of complex systems. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the transmission and reception of signals, which involves the use of a communication channel. This falls under the purview of networking and internet architecture, which deals with the design, implementation, and management of computer networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the processing of signals received by the radar, which involves the detection of targets and the cancellation of noise.
