Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are the most likely categories. The paper also involves the study of multispectra, which are related to combinatorial designs, suggesting cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as another possible category. Additionally, the paper presents code constructions and analyzes their cardinality, which are related to coding theory, suggesting cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as another possible category. Finally, the paper involves the study of efficient encoding and decoding maps, which are related to computational geometry, suggesting cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
