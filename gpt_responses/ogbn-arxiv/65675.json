The paper proposes a new objective function for training neural dialogue generation models, which is a common topic in the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Softmax Cross-Entropy (SCE) loss, which are relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two different datasets, which relates to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
