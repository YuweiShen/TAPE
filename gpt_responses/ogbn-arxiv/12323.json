The paper also mentions modifications to predator and prey attributes, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of simulation experiments also involves machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses military-relevant scenarios, which could potentially fall under robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
