The paper proposes a novel fusion structure and a residual fusion block to model the interdependencies between the RGB and depth data, which involves learning complementary features and extracting modality-specific features. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
