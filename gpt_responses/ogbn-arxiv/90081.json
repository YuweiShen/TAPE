The use of a stochastic natural motion model and a leading agent (e.g., an unmanned aerial vehicle) also suggests a focus on robotics and control systems. The paper also discusses the construction of a topological map of the environment using encounter information from the swarm, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Finally, the paper presents simulation results to illustrate and verify the correctness of the proposed algorithm, which suggests a focus on computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
