The use of templates and arbitrary natural images for database generation also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The fact that the problem domain is related to autonomous driving indicates that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning for object detection and the potential for security applications suggest that it could belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
