This involves training a generative model as an agent to investigate risky distribution parameters for a given driving algorithm being evaluated, and regarding the task algorithm as an environment that returns a reward to the agent when a risky scenario is generated. This work involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in terms of the generative model and agent-based approach, as well as machine learning (cs.LG) in terms of training the generative model. It also involves aspects of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) in terms of the autonomous driving application, and systems and control (cs.SY) in terms of the safety-critical nature of the scenarios being generated."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
