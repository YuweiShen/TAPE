It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it discusses the behavior and performance of the spiking Multi-Layer Perceptron in comparison to a conventional deep network. Additionally, the paper applies the architecture to a classification problem (MNIST), which suggests it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions that the spiking network is a natural architecture for learning based on streaming event-based data, which could place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
