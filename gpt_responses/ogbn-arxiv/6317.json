The authors also mention the use of various machine learning techniques such as distributed softmax loss and class-aware sampling, which fall under the category of deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of expert models and heavier classifiers, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention the use of tag systems, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with image datasets, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
