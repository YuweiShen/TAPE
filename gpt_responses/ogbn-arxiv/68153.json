The paper specifically focuses on developing a corpus of explanations for standardized science exams, which involves constructing explanation graphs and a tablestore to support multi-hop inference. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Computation and Language (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
