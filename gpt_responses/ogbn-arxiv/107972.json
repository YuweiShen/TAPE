The paper also proposes solutions to the paradox, which involve modeling the world and relaxing coordination requirements, respectively. These solutions involve logical reasoning and mathematical modeling, which are relevant to the sub-categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
