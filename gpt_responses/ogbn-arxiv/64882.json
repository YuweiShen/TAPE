The tool also integrates machine learning models as annotation recommenders, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The tool is designed to improve the speed and quality of dialogue data annotation, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The tool also has a dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the tool is open source and publicly available, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
