The paper also discusses theoretical learning principles and optimization techniques, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of stochastic latent space and information bottleneck principle also suggests relevance to neural networks (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
