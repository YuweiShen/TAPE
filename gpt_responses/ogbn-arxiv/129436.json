This makes it highly likely that the paper belongs to the cs.DB sub-category. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on location-based social networks (LBSNs) and proposes a two-layer hybrid index structure called Network Embedding Time-aware R-tree (NETR-tree) to handle social-based time-aware spatial keyword queries. This makes it highly likely that the paper belongs to the cs.SI sub-category. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of spatial keyword queries in location-based social networks (LBSNs) and proposes a query processing algorithm to efficiently retrieve the top-k objects based on geo-spatial score, keywords similarity, visiting time score, and social relationship effect. This makes it highly likely that the paper belongs to the cs.IR sub-category. \n4. cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on location-based social networks (LBSNs) and proposes a two-layer hybrid index structure called Network Embedding Time-aware R-tree (NETR-tree) to handle social-based time-aware spatial keyword queries.
