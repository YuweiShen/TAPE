The paper proposes a general stability training method to stabilize deep networks, which indicates that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The method involves training the network to be robust against common image processing techniques, such as compression, rescaling, and cropping, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on tasks such as near-duplicate detection and classification on noisy datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
