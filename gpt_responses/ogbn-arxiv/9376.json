This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions two IoT applications for statistical summarization and predictive analytics, which involve processing and analyzing data to extract insights. This falls under the scope of information retrieval.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the use of DSPS for managing and processing data streams from IoT sensors, which involves storing and retrieving data from databases.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of IoT sensors to monitor physical, environmental, and human systems in real-time, which involves networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a benchmark suite and performance metrics to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications, which involves software engineering principles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
