This falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of pre-trained CNNs and SVMs also suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The real-world applications mentioned in the abstract, such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), demographic-based classification, biometric-based recognition, security, and defense, suggest that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
