Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.LG) for layout simplification and bridge computation. The paper proposes an integer linear programming formulation (cs.ET - Emerging Technologies) and a semidefinite programming approximation (cs.SD - Systems and Control) for solving the layout decomposition problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
