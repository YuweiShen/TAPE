These problems are related to graph expansion, which is a fundamental topic in computer science and falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves computational complexity (cs.CC) as it discusses the complexity of the problems and presents approximation algorithms. The algorithms presented in the paper involve combinatorial and geometric techniques, which are commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves information theory (cs.IT) as it uses the concept of expansion to measure the quality of a cut in a hypergraph."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
