The paper proposes a method for transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, which involves training the student model using a smaller set of labelled data. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to topics such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and information retrieval (cs.IR). However, since the focus of the paper is on intrusion detection, we rank cs.CR as the most likely category, followed by the other categories in descending order of relevance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
