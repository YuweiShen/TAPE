This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it deals with natural language processing and understanding. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of QA systems. \n- cs.LG (Learning) as it involves training models on a synthetic corpus and evaluating on human corpora. \n- cs.SD (Sound) as it deals with Automatic Speech Recognition systems and their impact on downstream QA systems. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as QA systems involve retrieving relevant information from a given text or speech input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
