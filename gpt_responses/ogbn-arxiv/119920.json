The paper also involves the analysis of the maximum edge-density of 1-bend RAC graphs, which is related to graph theory (cs.DM) and graph algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also presents new results on the upper and lower bounds of the maximum edge-density, which is a topic in computational complexity and optimization (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of RAC drawings in information visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
