The paper proposes a new trainable parameter and a smooth regularizer to eliminate unnecessary neurons and encourage a small number of neurons after elimination. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the focus of the paper is on neural network architectures, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
