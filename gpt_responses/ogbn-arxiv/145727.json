This involves techniques from data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG) for handling planar graphs. The use of stretch in the query time suggests information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The construction of the oracle involves analyzing the graph structure, which could fall under discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the use of stretch and the focus on efficiency suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
