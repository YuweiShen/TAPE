This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses algorithms for computation complexity reduction, which could be categorized under networked systems (cs.NI) and mathematical optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a unified framework for hybrid transceiver design, which could be considered as a system-level approach and hence falls under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
