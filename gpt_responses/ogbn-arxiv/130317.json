This involves reducing the training phase and computational requirements to scale IoT deployments. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper focuses on using RL to automate the configuration process. The paper also deals with IoT and energy harvesting, which suggests cs.IOT (Internet of Things) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as likely categories. Additionally, the paper proposes using a single policy for nodes with similar lighting conditions, which involves clustering and similarity analysis, indicating cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another possible category. Finally, the paper deals with optimizing the sampling rate of sensors, which involves decision-making and optimization, suggesting cs.RO (Robotics) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
