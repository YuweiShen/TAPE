Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The proposed approach involves using auxiliary training objectives to guide the NMT model, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of hidden representations in the NMT model implies the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) and possibly computer vision (cs.CV) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
