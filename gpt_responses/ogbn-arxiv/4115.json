The use of analog coding and channel polarization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the title of the paper mentions \"optimal measurement matrix\", which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of mathematical methods in CS (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
