This topic falls under the field of information theory and communication systems, which are covered by the cs.IT and cs.COMM sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of matrix decomposition and sphere decoding, which are techniques commonly used in the fields of systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed PAPR reduction method, which may involve hardware considerations and network protocols, making the cs.NI sub-category a possible fit as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
