Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of SAT solvers, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). Finally, the paper uses tree automata, which is a topic in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
