The paper also evaluates the method in three robotics settings, indicating a potential overlap with robotics (cs.RO). The approach involves training an object detector, which could involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions a video summary, suggesting a potential focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
