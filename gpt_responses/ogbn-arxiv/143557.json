The proposed system uses vision-based algorithms to compute costmaps and identify safe landing sites, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The system also employs clustering and trajectory planning algorithms, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the system is evaluated using experiments in simulation and real-world scenarios, which involves machine learning techniques for performance evaluation (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
