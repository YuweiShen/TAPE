This work is primarily focused on improving the performance of neural networks, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of features learned by the nodes, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The use of deep asymmetric networks for image classification tasks also suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the potential for pruning nodes to reduce network complexity, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the transfer of deep asymmetric networks from famous networks, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
