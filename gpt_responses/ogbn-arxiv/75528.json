Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a method that involves deep learning and fusion of different streams, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with video sequences, which could make it relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
