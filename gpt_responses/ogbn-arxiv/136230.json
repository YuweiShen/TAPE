The paper specifically focuses on pruning filters during training, which is a technique for reducing the memory and computational requirements of deep networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper proposes a new methodology for pruning filters, it may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
