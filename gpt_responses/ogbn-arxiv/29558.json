The use of atomic norm minimization (ANM) and semi-definite programming (SDP) techniques also suggests a strong connection to information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the problem of DOA estimation is relevant in many networked systems, such as wireless sensor networks and radar systems.\n3. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with a signal processing problem, specifically the problem of DOA estimation using L-shaped arrays. The use of cross-covariance matrices and ANM techniques is also common in signal processing.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of ANM and SDP techniques suggests a connection to optimization and convex programming, which are common in machine learning.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes two gridless methods for DOA estimation that are designed to improve computational efficiency. This suggests a strong connection to numerical analysis and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
