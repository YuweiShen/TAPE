This involves a developmental 2-stage approach where deep learning algorithms use passive raw sensor observations of world changes to learn a corresponding latent space in a perceptual learning stage, and then goal exploration happens in a second stage by sampling goals in this latent space. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
