It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories as it proposes a modification to the MLP architecture to reduce the number of parameters. Additionally, it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories as these fields often use neural networks for natural language processing tasks, which can also benefit from the proposed modification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
