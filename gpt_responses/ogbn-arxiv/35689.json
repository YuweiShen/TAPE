This involves coding techniques to protect against passive eavesdropping. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also deals with channel resolvability and coding for compound channels with continuous alphabets, which are topics related to Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a method for incorporating security constraints into approximation schemes, which is a topic related to Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
