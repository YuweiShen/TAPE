The use of deep learning techniques such as multilevel region-of-interest pooling and iterative bounding box voting suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of text characteristic prior bounding boxes and filtering algorithms, which are common techniques in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
