This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed mode variational LSTM is a modification of the original LSTM structure, which involves additional gating functionality to regulate what features should be stored in the additional cell state. This modification is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses a new dynamic facial expression dataset with different modes of variation, including pose and illumination variations, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
