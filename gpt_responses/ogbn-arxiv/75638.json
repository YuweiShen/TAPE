Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves optimization and control problems, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses algorithms and their performance, which could fall under the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control).
