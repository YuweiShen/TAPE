The use of covariance matrices and non-orthogonal pilot sequences also suggests a potential connection to statistical inference (cs.ST) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on the benefits of covariance-aided CSI acquisition in massive MIMO, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP) and communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
