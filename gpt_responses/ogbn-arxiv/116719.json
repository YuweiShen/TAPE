Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of a large corpus of human-created descriptions, which suggests the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, making cs.MM and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on a newly created tennis video dataset, which suggests the use of information retrieval (IR) techniques, making cs.IR a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
