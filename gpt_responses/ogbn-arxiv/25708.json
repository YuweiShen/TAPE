The use of self-attention to iteratively reason about the relations between entities in a scene and to guide a model-free policy is a machine learning technique.\n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach for deep reinforcement learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance on six mini-games in the StarCraft II Learning Environment, surpassing human grandmaster performance on four. This is an artificial intelligence task.\n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses structured perception and relational reasoning to improve the efficiency and generalization capacity of deep reinforcement learning. This involves reasoning about the relations between entities in a scene, which is a computer vision task.\n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a new approach for deep reinforcement learning that improves upon the efficiency and generalization capacity of conventional approaches. This has potential applications in robotics, where efficient and generalizable reinforcement learning is important.\n\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a new approach for deep reinforcement learning that uses self-attention to iteratively reason about the relations between entities in a scene and to guide a model-free policy"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
