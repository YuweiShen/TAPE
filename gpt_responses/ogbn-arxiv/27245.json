The proposed solution involves symbolic execution and algebraic rewriting, which are techniques used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of an existing protocol analyser (ProVerif), which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions the formalisation of the algorithm and computational soundness, which are topics in software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
