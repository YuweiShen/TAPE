The use of a weighting system and the concept of aggregations and decompositions also suggest a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and computer communication (cs.CC). Additionally, the mention of C-tests, which are language proficiency tests, may indicate a connection to software engineering (cs.SE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
