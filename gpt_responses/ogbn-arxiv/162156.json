Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions applications to deep neural nets and gradient-dominated objective functions, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses convergence rates and optimization, which are relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
