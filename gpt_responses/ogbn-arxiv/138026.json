This involves transforming skeleton videos into images and developing a CNN-based framework. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) are also possible categories since the paper deals with video analysis and human action recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
