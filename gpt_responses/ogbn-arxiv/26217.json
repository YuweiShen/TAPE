The paper proposes a cost function for integrating multiple datasets with heterogeneous label subsets, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on two different medical imaging datasets, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the CNNs, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
