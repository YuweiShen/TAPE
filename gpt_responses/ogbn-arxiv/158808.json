This involves developing a unique set of losses that can gather similar samples nearby within a low-density space while keeping invariant features intact against data augmentation. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
