The authors also consider the effects of noise and interference, which are common in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper proposes a new technique for improving the performance of MIMO systems, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The authors specifically focus on the use of rate-splitting, which is a technique used in wireless communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of their findings, which could be relevant to the networking and communication community (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
