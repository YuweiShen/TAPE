The focus is on achieving adequate coverage with high gain antennas, which is a topic of interest in the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of power-law models to represent the path gain-distance dependence, which is a common approach in the field of millimeter-wave communications (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper involves the use of specialized equipment to emulate a base station, which is relevant to the field of mobile computing (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the issue of azimuth gains being degraded through scattering, which is a topic of interest in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
