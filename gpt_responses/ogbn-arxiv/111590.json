This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a dataset, which suggests that it may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also mentions real-time performance, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the handling of challenging cases under varying lighting conditions, which suggests that it may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
