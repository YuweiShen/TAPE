The proposed method involves the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of a Bayesian framework for classifier weighting and combination, which is a common approach in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves the use of natural language processing techniques, such as text recognition, which is a subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
