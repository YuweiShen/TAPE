The focus on word relatedness judgment suggests a strong connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of deep learning embeddings and the comparison to one-hot vectors suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of distributional models also suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
