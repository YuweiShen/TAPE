The use of saliency maps for explaining the model's predictions suggests a focus on interpretability and explainable AI, which could also place the paper in the information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of hyperspectral data and the identification of the most sensitive wavelength could also relate to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
