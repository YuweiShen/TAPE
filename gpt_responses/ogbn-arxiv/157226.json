The paper also uses text data from social media platforms like Twitter and Yelp, which are commonly used in NLP research. \n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper analyzes the impact of lexical choice on audience perception in the context of social media platforms like Twitter and Yelp. The study also examines how users describe themselves in social media profiles, which is a topic related to social network analysis. \n\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes two classes of algorithms to estimate the effect of changing one word to another in a given sentence on audience perception. The algorithms use observational data and treat treatment effect estimation as a classification problem, which are both common techniques in machine learning. \n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper examines the impact of lexical choice on audience perception, which is a topic related to the intersection of technology and society. The study also analyzes data from social media platforms, which raises questions about privacy, bias, and ethics. \n\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper uses text data from Yelp, Twitter, and Airbnb to analyze the impact of lexical choice on audience perception"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
