The use of non-linear path signature techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of datasets and experimental results suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of a fully-connected network for classification suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
