This involves decision making over a tree and learning an optimal policy. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the use of deep neural networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) categories. Finally, the focus on learning an optimal policy for a system suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
