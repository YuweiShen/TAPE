The use of polynomial expansion to reduce computational complexity suggests a focus on optimization and algorithms (cs.MA). The paper also discusses serving multiple users with limited resources, which is a common problem in networked systems (cs.NI). The simulation results and analytical expression for sum rate suggest a focus on statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.SI), and the use of random matrix theory further supports this. Finally, the paper's focus on achieving higher rates with low complexity suggests a focus on optimization and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
