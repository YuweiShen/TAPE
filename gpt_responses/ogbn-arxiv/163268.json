Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the challenges of relevance, latency, and scalability, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DL (Deep Learning). The use of a distributed computing platform indicates that it could also be relevant to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
