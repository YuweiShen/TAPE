The paper specifically discusses the use of Scheduled Sampling, a technique used in NLP and CV tasks, to mitigate the discrepancy between train and test time. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also discusses the effects of hyper-parameters on the model performance, which is a common topic in the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
