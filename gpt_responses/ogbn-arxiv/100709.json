Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes extensions of the I-MMSE relation to channels with feedback and/or memory, which are topics related to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of mathematical tools, such as de Bruijn's identity, which is related to Mathematics of Computing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper may have practical applications in communication networks, which is a topic related to Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
