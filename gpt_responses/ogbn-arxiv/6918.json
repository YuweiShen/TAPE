The problem of image provenance analysis is also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories, as it involves analyzing and retrieving information from large collections of images. The issue of public media manipulation and authorship verification is related to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of novel techniques for obtaining the provenance graph suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
