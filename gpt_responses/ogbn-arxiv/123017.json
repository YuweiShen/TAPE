It also uses information theory to model the query system (cs.IT) and compares differential privacy with min-entropy leakage, which is related to Bayesian inference (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the utility of the randomization mechanism, which is a common concern in database research (cs.DB). Finally, the paper proposes a method for building an optimal randomization mechanism, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
