The paper also discusses the impact of detection proposals on the performance of object detection algorithms, which is related to machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a novel metric for evaluating detection proposals, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
