The experiments involve training convolutional neural networks for image classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses exploration and optimization of local optima, which could fall under neural evolution (cs.NE) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
