The paper proposes a framework for handling label mistakes during NER model training, which involves training independent NER models to identify potential mistakes in each fold and adjusting the weights of training data accordingly. This framework involves machine learning techniques such as cross-validation and model ensembling, which are commonly used in subfields such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the accuracy of NER models, which is a common goal in the subfield of named entity recognition (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
