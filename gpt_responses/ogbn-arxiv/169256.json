Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of the surrogate models for predicting the aeroelastic response of the coupled system, which falls under the Control Engineering (cs.SY) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves the use of open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for generating data, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
