This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also discusses the impact of synchronization on system performance, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of massive MIMO and OFDM suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
