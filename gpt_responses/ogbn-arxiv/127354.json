The study also involves analyzing the eye movement behavior of human observers, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed age-adapted framework for saliency prediction involves machine learning techniques, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed model using area under the curve (AUC) metrics, which is a common evaluation metric in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
