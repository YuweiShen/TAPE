Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also explores the structural properties of the automata, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of quantum mechanics in the automata suggests cs.QL (Quantum Physics) as another possible sub-category.
