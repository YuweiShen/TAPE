The paper also involves the study of the maximum flow rate (cs.IT) and the modeling of cover traffic as a renewal process (cs.NI). The paper uses analytical expressions to explore the properties of the embedding capacity (cs.SI) and tests the solution on real network traces (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
