The paper also discusses the role of information in fair prediction and how increasing information content through refinements can improve downstream selection rules across a wide range of fairness measures. Given the focus on machine learning and fairness, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
