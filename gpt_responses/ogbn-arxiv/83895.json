This involves analyzing the hardware architecture and optimizing data bandwidth. \n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The PSoC discussed in the paper is an embedded system that combines an ARM core with programmable logic cells. The paper evaluates the performance of data transfers between the embedded processor and programmable logic cells. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses a CNN accelerator that processes visual information from a neuromorphic visual sensor for classification. This involves computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. \n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The use of PSoCs and CNN accelerators are emerging technologies in the field of computer engineering. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the use of a CNN accelerator for classification, which involves neural computing techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
