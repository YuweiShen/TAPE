The use of expected value of information (EVOI) is a Bayesian approach, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also emphasizes the importance of making queries more cognitively manageable for users, which suggests a potential relevance to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the proposed method for large item spaces, which suggests a potential relevance to the complex systems (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
