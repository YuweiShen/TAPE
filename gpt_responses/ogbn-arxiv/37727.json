This falls under the domain of computer architecture and digital circuits. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.arch, followed by cs.circuits and cs.vlsi. The paper also discusses power, energy, and area-related metrics, which are relevant to performance evaluation, making cs.performance a likely sub-category. Finally, since the adders are implemented in a specific technology, cs.embedded systems could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
