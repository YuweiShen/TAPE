This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the practical aspects of the technique, such as channel estimation and implementation, which could fall under the categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and computer networks (cs.COM). Finally, the paper specifically addresses the issue of interference with a primary system, which falls under the category of cognitive radio (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
