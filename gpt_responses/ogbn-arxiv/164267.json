The paper also discusses stochastic gradient algorithms, which are commonly used in numerical optimization, making cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) another likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a new inequality that may be applied to analyze other stochastic gradient algorithms, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms).
