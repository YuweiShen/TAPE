The proposed approach involves collecting a novel restaurant photo dataset and using a deep multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) framework to classify the restaurant styles. This involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). However, the paper also involves aspects of information retrieval (cs.IR), multimedia (cs.MM), natural language processing (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI) as it deals with mining crowd-sourced photos from user review websites."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
