This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the paper introduces decision-theoretic control of displays, which involves using artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques to enhance computer displays used for monitoring complex systems. The paper also discusses expected value of revealed information (EVRI) and expected value of displayed information (EVDI), which are measures that can be used to enhance computer displays used for monitoring complex systems. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Cybersecurity (cs.CY), and Software Engineering (cs.SE) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
