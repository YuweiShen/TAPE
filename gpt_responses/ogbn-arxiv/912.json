This type of problem is commonly studied in information retrieval (cs.IR) and database (cs.DB) research, as well as in machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS) fields. Additionally, the paper discusses the internal geometry of the amino acid alphabet, which could be relevant to computational biology and bioinformatics (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
