The technique proposed in the paper involves using user feedback to disambiguate query images, which is a common approach in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions clustering and re-ranking techniques, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper uses a novel feedback integration technique, which could potentially fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
