The paper also discusses the use of domain-specific knowledge to improve segmentation accuracy, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific application of the technique to neuroscience and cell biology suggests that it may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
