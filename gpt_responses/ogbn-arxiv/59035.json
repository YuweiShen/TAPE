This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses incorporating hand-crafted information into end-to-end learning, which relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach involves retraining the model from scratch with a reduced training dataset, which may involve optimization techniques related to neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
