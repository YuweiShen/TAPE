It discusses user selection schemes and multiuser secrecy gains, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and network security (cs.CR). The use of antennas and channel state information also suggests a possible categorization under networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions low-complexity user selection schemes, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) if they involve audio or video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
