The paper also involves network flows and queuing theory, which are relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Performance (cs.PF) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use case for emerging switch-based caching, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
