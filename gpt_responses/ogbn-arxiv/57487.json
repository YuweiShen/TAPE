Additionally, the paper introduces an extension of Strategy logic for the imperfect-information setting, which is a topic that falls under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses multi-player games with imperfect information, which is a topic that falls under Game Theory (cs.GT). Furthermore, the paper introduces a syntactical class of \"hierarchical instances,\" which is a topic that falls under Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). Overall, the paper covers a wide range of topics that are relevant to several sub-categories in Computer Science, but the most likely sub-categories are cs.LO and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
