The use of randomly-designed quantizers and the analysis of their performance can also be related to machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The concept of entropy is also mentioned, which is a topic in information theory and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of thresholds and the analysis of their distribution can be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
