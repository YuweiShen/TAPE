The validation of the approach is also performed on a humanoid robot.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the calibration of sensors that are used in control systems, specifically force-torque sensors that are used to measure the interaction forces between a robot and its environment.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper proposes a technique to calibrate sensors that are commonly used in mechanical engineering applications, such as robotics, manufacturing, and material testing.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the proposed calibration technique involves exploiting the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements of the sensor and the corresponding force-torque, which could be seen as a form of machine learning.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the proposed calibration technique involves using an accelerometer to measure the motion of the rigid body to which the force-torque sensor is attached, which could be seen as a form of visual-inertial odometry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
