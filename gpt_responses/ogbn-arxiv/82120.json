Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the stability of Reeb graphs under function perturbations, which involves concepts from topology and dynamical systems, making cs.DS (Dynamical Systems) and cs.GR (Graphics) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions curves, which are often studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI), making these sub-categories also possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
