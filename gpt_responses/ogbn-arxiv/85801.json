The focus is on Skip-Gram based graph embeddings, which are a popular method for learning low-dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph. The paper presents experiments on different real datasets, which suggests that the use of popular centrality distributions in sampling leads to improvements in learning times and accuracy. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
