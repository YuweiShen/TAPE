The paper focuses on the selection of training and testing data, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of features and classifiers, which are common topics in neural networks (cs.NE) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of keypoints, which is a common topic in image retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
