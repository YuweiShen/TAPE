It also involves the use of a specialized distance-vector protocol to optimize network paths dynamically. \n\nIt could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category as it involves the development of a system that can respond to changing network conditions at hardware speeds. \n\nDistributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with routing in large networks and involves the decomposition of network-wide policies into switch-local P4 programs. \n\nThe Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category is also possible as the paper presents a new approach to routing that involves the development of a specialized distance-vector protocol. \n\nFinally, Programming Languages (cs.PL) is a possible sub-category as the paper involves the use of a compiler to analyze network-wide policies and decompose them into switch-local P4 programs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
