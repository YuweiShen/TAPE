It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as principal component analysis is a common technique used in machine learning. The algorithmic nature of the paper suggests that it may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of Fourier-Bessel basis and non-uniform fast Fourier transform suggests that it may belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the mention of rotations and reflections suggests that it may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
