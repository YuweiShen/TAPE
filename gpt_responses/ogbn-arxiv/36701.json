This involves leveraging operation pipelining and multi-rate clocks to perform a minimal amount of computation for each frame per timestep. These models are applied to existing image architectures and analysed on two video tasks: action recognition and human keypoint localisation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) are also possible sub-categories given the focus on video processing and deep learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
