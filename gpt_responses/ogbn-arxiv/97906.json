The paper discusses the theoretical analysis of the proposed framework and explores a progressive identification method for minimizing the risk estimator. The paper also presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
