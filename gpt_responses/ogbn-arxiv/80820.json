This falls under the domain of software engineering, making cs.SE the most likely category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The application described in the paper involves checking spreadsheet formulas and data, which could involve programming language concepts such as syntax, semantics, and type checking. This makes cs.PL a likely category.\n- cs.CY (Computational Geometry): There is no direct mention of computational geometry in the paper, but the application could potentially involve geometric calculations or data visualization, which could fall under this category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses reducing risks associated with Excel spreadsheets, which could involve security concerns such as data privacy and integrity. This makes cs.CR a possible category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The application described in the paper involves checking data in Excel spreadsheets, which could involve concepts related to databases such as data modeling, querying, and normalization. This makes cs.DB a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
