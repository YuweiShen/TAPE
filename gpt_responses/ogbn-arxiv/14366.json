It could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as deep learning is widely used in computer vision applications. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep learning is a subfield of AI. The paper also discusses safety concerns, which could place it under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the proposed algorithm FROWN could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it is a neural network optimization-based approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
