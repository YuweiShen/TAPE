It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a common task in IR. Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of hierarchical encoding suggests it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
