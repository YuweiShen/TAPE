The paper discusses the self-organization power of robot systems and formation problems in the 3D-space. The paper also proposes a new plane formation algorithm for solvable instances. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
