The use of statistical learning theory suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses measure-theoretic issues, which are relevant to optimization (cs.Optimization). Finally, the application of the scenario approach to stochastic model predictive control suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
