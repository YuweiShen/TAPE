This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Game Theory sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with dynamic distributed spectrum sharing among secondary users, which is a networking problem. The paper also mentions time-division multiple-access (TDMA) as a possible implementation, which is a common technique in networking. Therefore, cs.NI is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions interference temperature (IT) constraints imposed by primary users, which is a concept from information theory. Therefore, cs.IT is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with designing a framework for dynamic distributed spectrum sharing, which involves control of the system. Therefore, cs.SY is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions multi-user interference, which is a common problem in multimedia communication. Therefore, cs.MM is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
