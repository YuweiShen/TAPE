The paper also discusses the use of deep neural networks (cs.LG) and unsupervised learning (cs.AI) for part-based image classification. Additionally, the proposed approach has potential applications in instance-based image retrieval (cs.IR) and indexing tasks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
