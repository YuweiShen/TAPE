This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) as it involves the study of communication systems and their limits. The paper also involves optimization techniques for solving the detection problem, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of one-bit ADCs also involves the study of networked systems (cs.NI) and the application of these techniques to massive MIMO systems falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
