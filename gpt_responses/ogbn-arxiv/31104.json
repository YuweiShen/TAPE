The policy involves understanding real images, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The use of neural networks for policy learning falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the policy is designed to be deployed on a real robot, which involves system integration and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
