The system being studied is a hybrid parallel power-line/wireless OFDM system, which falls under the networked systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The proposed scheme involves the use of artificial noise to enhance security, which is a common technique in cryptography and network security (cs.CR). The paper also investigates the effect of power levels and power allocation on secure throughput, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
