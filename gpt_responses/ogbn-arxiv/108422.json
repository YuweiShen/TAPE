The paper specifically focuses on the reduction of code reuse gadget counts as a metric for measuring security improvements. This topic is most closely related to the Computer Security (cs.CR) sub-category, as the paper discusses the effectiveness of debloating in preventing code reuse attacks such as return-oriented programming (ROP). However, the paper also touches on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) as it discusses techniques for debloating software and the impact of debloating on the availability of useful gadgets. The paper also discusses the use of static binary analysis tools (cs.SY) for measuring the effectiveness of debloating and proposes new metrics for evaluating debloating techniques (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
