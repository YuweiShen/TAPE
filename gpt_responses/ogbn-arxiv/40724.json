The paper also discusses the computational work on LIGs and the sample complexity for maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) in their framework. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Game Theory and Mechanism Design). The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as maximum-likelihood estimation and convex loss minimization, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the potential applications of their approach to large (social) networks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper discusses the interplay between goodness-of-fit and model complexity, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
