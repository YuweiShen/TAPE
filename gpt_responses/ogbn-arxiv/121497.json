Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of appropriate cross-channel interaction, which relates to neural networks (cs.NE), and evaluates the proposed method on mobile devices, which relates to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
