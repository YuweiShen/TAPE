This topic falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communication (cs.COMM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper also discusses the Relay Channel (RC), which falls under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also mentions the availability of CSI at the deterministic receivers, which falls under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category.
