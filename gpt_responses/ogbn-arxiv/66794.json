The proposed method is based on photometric stereo (PS), which is a well-known technique for recovering surface normals from images taken under different lighting conditions. The paper introduces a novel objective function based on the reprojection error in terms of depth, which is a more natural and intuitive measure of shape than surface normals. The method is formulated as a non-convex variational minimization problem, which is solved using a recently published optimization scheme for non-convex and non-smooth cost functions. The paper also presents a detailed convergence analysis of the algorithm and discusses ways to reduce its computational complexity. Overall, the paper is likely to be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), as it deals with a fundamental problem in this field and proposes a novel method based on PS. Other possible categories include cs.GR (Graphics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
