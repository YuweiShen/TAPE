The use of frequency oracles and post-processing techniques to achieve accurate and consistent estimations is a problem that falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the theoretical properties of the proposed methods, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
