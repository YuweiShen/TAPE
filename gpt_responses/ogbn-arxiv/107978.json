The paper also discusses computational inference and optimization algorithms, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. The use of higher-order models and advanced rounding schemes also suggests relevance to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of graphical models and cutting-plane algorithms suggests relevance to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
