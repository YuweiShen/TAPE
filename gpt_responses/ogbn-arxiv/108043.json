The paper also mentions \"learning to design\" tasks, which is a common application of AI. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper presents a max-margin approach for learning in hybrid domains, which is a common technique in machine learning. The paper also mentions \"learning from examples\", which is a common theme in machine learning. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the use of a state-of-the-art solver for implementing the inference and separation oracles of Structured Output SVMs, which is relevant to software engineering. \n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper mentions the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories, which is a technique used in programming languages. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of a solver for optimization over continuous linear arithmetical constraints, which is relevant to data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
