The use of distributional semantic models (DSMs) is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL), which falls under the cs.CL sub-category. The paper also mentions the integration of multilingual DSMs, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), hence cs.AI and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of DSMs for computing semantic relatedness and correlation, which are tasks related to information retrieval (IR), hence cs.IR is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of an API for configuring and accessing DSM parameters, which involves techniques from deep learning (DL), hence cs.DL is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
