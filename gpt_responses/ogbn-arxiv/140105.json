The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of adversarial examples, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for improving the robustness of neural networks, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
