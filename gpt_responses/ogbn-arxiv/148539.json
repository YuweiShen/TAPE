The use of geometric embeddings and rounding schemes suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and approximation algorithms (cs.DS). The study of worst-case ratios and integrality gaps also suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the use of computational experiments suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
