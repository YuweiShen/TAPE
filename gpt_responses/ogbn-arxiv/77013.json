This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the optimal detector for a general parameterization of the phase noise distribution, which falls under the domain of systems and control (cs.SY). The analysis of the symbol-error-rate (SER) floor involves statistical analysis, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the extension of the system model to multiple data channel uses involves multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which falls under the domain of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
