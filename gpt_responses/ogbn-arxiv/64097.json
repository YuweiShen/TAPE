The paper discusses the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provides an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. The paper also presents initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the game's partially observed map, which suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses game theory and multi-agent interactions, which suggests a potential connection to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
