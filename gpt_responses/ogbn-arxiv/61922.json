The paper also involves developing a deep learning network (AON) to recognize irregular texts, which falls under the subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions using attention-based decoding, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves training the network using only images and word-level annotations, which falls under the subfield of unsupervised or semi-supervised learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on various benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
