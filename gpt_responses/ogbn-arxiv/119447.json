This involves a characterization of developable surfaces as manifolds that can be parameterized through orthogonal geodesics. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves modeling and manipulation of surfaces, which could also place it in the Graphics (cs.GR) and Geometric Topology (cs.GT) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the ties between the discrete model and smooth developable surfaces, which could place it in the Symmetric Functions (cs.SG) sub-category. Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the discrete model in a developable surface editing system, which could place it in the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
