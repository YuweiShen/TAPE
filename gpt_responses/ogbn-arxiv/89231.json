The concept of a coding distance between channels is also relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of hyperplane arrangements suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) or discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the study of error probabilities is a common theme in computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
