The proposed codes are based on MDS codes, which are a topic in coding theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the applications of the codes to file synchronization, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DC) and security and privacy (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes deterministic polynomial time encoding and decoding schemes, which is a topic in control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
