Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on the interaction between natural language and computation. The paper also involves pre-training on large-scale image-text datasets, which falls under the scope of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper proposes a new pre-training method and conducts extensive experiments, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on various Vision-and-Language tasks, which is related to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
