The paper proposes a method for automatically tuning the $\\lambda$ parameter using cross-validation, which is a common technique in statistical learning and data science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also deals with control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.DS) aspects, which are relevant to the reinforcement learning problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
