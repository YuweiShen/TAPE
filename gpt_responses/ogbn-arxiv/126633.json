The focus on procurement auctions with private costs suggests a connection to algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS). The use of submodular functions as a key tool in the analysis points towards machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), where submodularity has been extensively studied in recent years."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
