This falls under the area of logic and automated reasoning, which is covered by the cs.LO sub-category. Additionally, the tool is a proof assistant, which is a type of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the graphical user interface of the tool, which falls under the area of programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper mentions empirical findings, which could be related to education and training (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
