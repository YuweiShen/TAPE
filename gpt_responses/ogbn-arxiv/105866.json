This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the differences between multivariate information measures, which may fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories.
