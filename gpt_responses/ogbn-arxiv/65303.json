Computer vision techniques are used extensively in this paper to extract features from images and estimate the age of the clothing items. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses two new datasets of clothing items from Flickr and museum collections, which are multimedia sources. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning methods for large-scale data organization or retrieval, which is a common problem in multimedia applications. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the potential applications of automatic methods for estimating the age of objects, including large-scale data organization or retrieval. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the information retrieval community. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning methods for temporal estimation, which falls under the domain of machine learning. The paper also fine-tunes new networks for this task, which is a common practice in machine learning research. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper discusses the use of deep learning methods for identifying temporal inspiration in fashion collections. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the natural language processing community, which deals with language-related tasks such as sentiment analysis and text classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
