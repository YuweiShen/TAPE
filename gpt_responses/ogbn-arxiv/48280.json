This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories such as Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on incorporating external knowledge to answer open-domain visual questions, it is most likely to belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The other sub-categories are also relevant as they involve the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for image analysis and natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
