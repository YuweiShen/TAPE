Additionally, the paper proposes a series of tools to model semantic inferences when machines process text, which is a common research area in cs.CL. \n\nThe paper is also likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it mentions the importance of having a computational representation of text as an abstract object, which is a key concept in information retrieval. \n\nFurthermore, the paper's focus on mathematical and computational robustness, expressiveness, and rigour of the tools used suggests that it could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper's mention of present and future problems with the current research paradigm in this area and recommendations on how to overcome them suggest that it could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
