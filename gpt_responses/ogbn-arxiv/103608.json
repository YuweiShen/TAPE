The practical applications mentioned in the abstract, such as detecting botnet activities and exploiting computer system side-channel information, suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computer security (cs.CR). The use of statistical inferencing approach to detect and localize radiation sources may also indicate that the paper could be relevant to the sub-category of data science (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of detecting shipping patterns suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
