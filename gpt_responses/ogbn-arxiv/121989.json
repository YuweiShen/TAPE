The use of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and sequential path planning methods suggests that this paper belongs to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of algorithms for trajectory planning and collision avoidance suggests that this paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the simulation of large-scale systems suggests that this paper may also belong to the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
