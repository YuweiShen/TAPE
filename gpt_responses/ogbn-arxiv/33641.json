The proposed method involves using a pre-defined index to retrieve a response prototype, which suggests the use of information retrieval techniques (cs.IR). The model also involves using an edit vector to revise the prototype response, which suggests the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper reports experimental results on a large scale dataset, which suggests the use of neural networks and deep learning techniques (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
