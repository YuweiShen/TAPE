The focus on the amount of global information required for equilibrium suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of algorithms and equilibria also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
