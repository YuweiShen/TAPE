The proposed solution involves building an ensemble of Linear SVM models, which is a machine learning technique commonly used in natural language processing and information retrieval tasks (cs.CL, cs.IR). The authors also mention that their approach showed great performance, which suggests that they may have used advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning or reinforcement learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the problem of clickbait detection is related to the broader field of social media analysis and online behavior modeling (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
