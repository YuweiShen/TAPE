The study of performance and complexity of these algorithms also falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, MIMO systems are often used in multimedia applications, which could place this paper in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
