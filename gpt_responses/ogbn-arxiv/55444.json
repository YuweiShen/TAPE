The proposed scheme involves multiple users transmitting their messages in an uncoordinated manner, which is a common scenario in wireless networks (cs.NI). The use of compressive sensing and joint decoding techniques also suggests a potential connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel coding scheme that leverages the randomness of the unsourced setting, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and graph theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
