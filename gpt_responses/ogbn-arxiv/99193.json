The methods proposed involve finding optimal monotone functions through Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process prior. This involves machine learning techniques such as deep value neural networks and softmax regression. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.LG, which deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper also deals with game theory (cs.GT) and computer vision (cs.CV) to some extent. Additionally, the use of Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization suggests a connection to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
