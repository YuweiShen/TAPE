The paper proposes a method to characterize this trade-off for a given architecture and provides theoretical insight into the trade-off. The paper also discusses the behavior of the trade-off curve for different network structures, which suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
