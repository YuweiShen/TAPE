The use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to solve this problem makes it relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a recurrent localization cell, which is a technique commonly used in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
