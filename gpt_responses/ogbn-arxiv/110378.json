The use of a neural model to predict sentence positions also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the task of summarization involves information retrieval and ranking, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of probability distributions and the mention of \"strong features\" suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
