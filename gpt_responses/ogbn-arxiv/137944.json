Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses optimization techniques for custom inference accelerators, which could fall under cs.AR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of quantization algorithms and evaluation of accuracy could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
