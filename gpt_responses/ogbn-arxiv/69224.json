The paper also discusses image reconstruction algorithms and their effectiveness, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the potential application of the oversampled binary sensing scheme in high dynamic range photography suggests the possibility of it falling under computer graphics (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
