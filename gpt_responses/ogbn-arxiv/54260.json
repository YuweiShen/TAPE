The paper proposes a method that can handle arbitrary sizes of batch inputs to achieve AQA on full resolution images by combining image padding with ROI pooling. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the theme criterion bias, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of DNNs for AQA suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves image processing and analysis, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
