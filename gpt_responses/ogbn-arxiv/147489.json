This falls under the category of cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also introduces a graph of oriented distances, which suggests a connection to graph theory and algorithms, falling under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The use of efficient algorithms and complexity analysis suggests a connection to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
