The focus of the paper is on developing a low complexity model for embedded systems, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of quantization for reducing memory requirements could also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions face detection as a specific use case, which could be considered multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
