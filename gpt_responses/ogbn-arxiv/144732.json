The use of multiple antennas and beamforming also involves signal processing and information theory (cs.IT). The paper specifically focuses on mmWave communication systems, which fall under the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed scanning strategies involve statistical analysis and memory-based algorithms, which could also be relevant to the subfields of systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
