The proposed methods involve optimizing the gradient-based attack method, which falls under the sub-field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper leverages the scale-invariant property of DNNs, which is a concept commonly studied in the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
