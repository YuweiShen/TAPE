It also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel framework for modeling user behavior, which involves attention mechanisms and encoding, indicating that it could also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
