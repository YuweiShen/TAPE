This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the social and economic implications of remote industrial facilities and the need for collaboration and software-based solutions to reduce costs. This aligns with the focus of cs.CY on the intersection of computing and society.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a software-based decision support solution, which falls under the scope of cs.SE.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of computational methods to engineering problems, which aligns with the focus of cs.CE.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the need for collaboration and decision support solutions tailored to Australian needs, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction and user-centered design.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the application of decision support solutions to industrial automation and smart energy systems, which falls under the scope of cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
