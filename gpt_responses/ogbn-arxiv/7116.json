This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). The paper also involves algebraic structures and properties of rings, which could be classified under computer algebra (cs.CR). The use of constacyclic codes and their reversibility may also fall under discrete structures (cs.DS) or numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
