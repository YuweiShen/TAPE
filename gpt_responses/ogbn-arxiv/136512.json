The paper also discusses the spatial distribution of mobile users, which falls under the category of spatial information (cs.SI). The explicit formula for ISR involves the use of mathematical functions, which could be categorized under mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the paper also discusses capacity and coverage planning, which could be related to game theory (cs.GT) in terms of optimizing network resources."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
