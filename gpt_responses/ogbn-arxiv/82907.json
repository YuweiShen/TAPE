It also involves the use of field automorphisms, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the computation of invariants, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and the use of these invariants to check for code inequivalence, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the number of equivalence classes of Gabidulin codes, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
