The paper also discusses the use of adaptive modulation, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). The proposed code is designed to have low complexity, which is a concern in networked systems and computer networks (cs.NI). Finally, the paper compares the proposed code to existing codes in terms of performance, which involves data analysis and statistics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
