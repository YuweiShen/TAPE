Information theory is the study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information, which is relevant to the proposed scheme. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a cooperative wireless system, which involves networking and internet architecture. The proposed scheme aims to maximize the average system throughput, which is a key performance metric in networking. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with a multi-user cooperative wireless system, which can be modeled as a social and information network. The proposed scheme aims to improve the network performance by optimizing the degree distribution of the Raptor codes. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a distributed coding scheme for a cooperative wireless system, which involves multiple transmitters and receivers. Distributed computing is relevant to the proposed scheme as it deals with the coordination and communication among multiple computing nodes. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper formulates a linear programming optimization problem to find the optimum degree distribution for the proposed cooperation schemes. Computational complexity is relevant to the proposed scheme as it deals with the efficiency and scalability of algorithms for solving optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
