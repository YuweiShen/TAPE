This falls under the category of machine learning, specifically regression. The use of pairwise comparison data is a common technique in learning-to-rank scenarios, which suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the convergence rate of the proposed methods, which suggests a connection to theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The empirical evaluation of the proposed methods involves linear models, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Overall, the paper's focus on machine learning and regression, along with its connections to information retrieval, theoretical computer science, and computer vision, suggest that cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
