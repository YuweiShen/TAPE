The use of regenerating codes to encode the database is a topic in distributed storage (cs.DS) and network coding (cs.NC), which are closely related to PIR. The paper also discusses the capacity of Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.IT) and distributed storage (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a PIR scheme for a specific class of Minimum Bandwidth Regenerating (MBR) codes, which is again related to distributed storage (cs.DS) and network coding (cs.NC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
