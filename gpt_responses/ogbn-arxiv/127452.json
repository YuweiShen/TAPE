The paper presents an information-theoretic framework to analyze disparate impact, which involves quantifying the divergence in output distributions over two groups. This framework is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), cryptography and security (cs.CR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), and computers and society (cs.CY). However, given the focus on machine learning and fairness, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.CR and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
