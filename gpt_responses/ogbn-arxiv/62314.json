It introduces a novel algorithm, Persistent Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), which extends FQI. The paper also presents an experimental campaign on benchmark domains to show the advantages of action persistence and proving the effectiveness of their persistence selection method. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
