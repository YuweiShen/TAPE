The paper also uses policy search methods, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The manipulation skills involve visual perception and object recognition, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the method on a real robot, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
