Game theory is a natural fit for analyzing auction and contest designs, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Crowdsourcing is a popular application of AI, and the paper discusses the use of virtual valuation functions to optimize crowdsourcing contests. \n3. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): The paper discusses the comparison of crowdsourcing contests with conventional procurement methods, which is a topic that falls under the intersection of economics and computation. \n4. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): There is no direct connection to cryptography or security in the paper, but the topic of crowdsourcing could potentially be applied to security-related tasks such as bug bounties or vulnerability assessments. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): While the paper does not focus on specific algorithms or data structures, the approximation results for crowdsourcing contests could be of interest to researchers in this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
