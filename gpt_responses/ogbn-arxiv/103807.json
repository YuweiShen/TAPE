The paper proposes a sparse recovery technique based on compressed sensing, which is a well-known technique in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also deals with dynamic changes in the network, such as link insertion and deletion, which is a common problem in network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper proposes a more efficient algorithm with a better theoretical upper bound, which is a common problem in algorithm design and analysis (cs.DS). The paper also presents experimental results, which is a common practice in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with network tomography, which is a subfield of network science and engineering (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
