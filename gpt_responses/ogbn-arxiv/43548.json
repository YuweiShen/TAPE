Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing). The paper derives explicit formulas for the condition numbers of the filtering matrices, which is related to matrix manipulation and optimization, and hence, cs.MM (Mathematical Software) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper presents analytical and simulation results, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning, and hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
