The paper also involves the creation of a new dataset for benchmarking, which falls under the subfield of graphics (cs.GR). The use of LiDAR and metadata for image processing and analysis suggests the involvement of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the quantitative evaluation of the groundtruthed disparities involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
