The paper focuses on the development of a Lyapunov neural network and a stabilizing constrained MPC, which are trained alternatively. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines neural networks and model predictive control to guarantee stability and extend the stable region of non-linear continuous control tasks with hard constraints. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on the development of a Lyapunov neural network and a stabilizing constrained MPC to control non-linear continuous control tasks with hard constraints. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics sub-category. \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines neural networks and model predictive control to guarantee stability and extend the stable region of non-linear continuous control tasks with hard constraints.
