This involves formulating Kernel-PCA as an energy minimization problem with low dimensionality constraints. The approach relies on robustly penalizing the rank of the recovered factors directly in the implicit feature space to create their low-dimensional approximations in closed form. This is a machine learning problem and hence, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category. \n\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper evaluates the proposed method on the challenging problem of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion and delivers promising results on CMU mocap dataset despite the presence of significant occlusions and noise. This is a computer vision problem and hence, cs.CV is the second most likely sub-category. \n\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel non-linear dimensionality regularization technique for solving inverse problems without pre-training.
