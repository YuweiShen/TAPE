This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG: The proposed approach involves a two-stage candidate component selection procedure and self-adaptive parameter setting, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and optimization algorithms.\n- cs.DS: The problem involves a set of bundle bids and transport contracts, which can be represented as data structures. The proposed approach also uses a large neighborhood search, which is a common technique in data structure optimization.\n- cs.CE: The problem involves a combinatorial procurement auction, which falls under the scope of computational economics. The paper also discusses the total procurement costs and transport quality, which are economic factors.\n- cs.RO: The paper proposes a metaheuristic approach that involves randomized search and large neighborhood search, which are common techniques in optimization and operations research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
