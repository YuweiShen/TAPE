The paper proposes a new method to compute the Contact Wrench Condition (CWC) for rectangular surfaces, which is of practical importance. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also involves computations and closed-form formulae, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.ME), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Computer Vision (cs.CV), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
