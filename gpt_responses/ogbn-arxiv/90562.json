The paper uses linear programming techniques and cut-sparsification techniques, which are commonly used in algorithms research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves randomized algorithms and analysis of algorithms, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
