This is a common theme in machine learning and optimization research.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithm that is agnostic to the amount of corruption chosen by the adaptive adversary. This is a common theme in adversarial machine learning research.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithm for a stochastic linear optimization problem. This is a common theme in algorithmic research.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of adversarial corruption, which is related to information theory and communication.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm that involves dividing time horizon into epochs with exponentially increasing size to limit the influence of corruption. This is a common theme in control theory and system identification research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
