The use of quantization messages and processing of output signals suggests a possible connection to networked information systems (cs.NI). The consideration of state-information at the transmitter and receivers also suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI). The use of relaying and common update information suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the improvement over the nofeedback capacity suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
