The paper proposes a novel factor graph model for argument mining that supports SVM and RNN parametrizations, can enforce structure constraints, and can express dependencies between adjacent relations and propositions. These techniques are commonly used in NLP and machine learning, which suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on web comments and argumentative essay datasets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
