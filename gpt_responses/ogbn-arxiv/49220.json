The study also involves comparing scaling properties of these distributions in both languages, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper examines small corpora of Polish literary texts, which could be relevant to computer science and computational linguistics (cs.CC). Finally, the study involves analyzing the grammatically basic forms of words tagged with their proper part of speech, which could be related to information retrieval and natural language processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
