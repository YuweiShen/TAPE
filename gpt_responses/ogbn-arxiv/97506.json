The paper presents a new result on bootstrapping hitting sets for algebraic circuits, which is a fundamental technique in PIT. The paper uses tools from computational complexity theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). Additionally, the paper involves geometric and combinatorial arguments, which suggest the possible sub-categories cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
