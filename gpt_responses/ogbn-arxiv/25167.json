The focus on graph representation and optimization also suggests a potential fit with subfields such as computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). However, given the emphasis on algorithmic efficiency and practical implementation, we believe that the aforementioned subfields are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
