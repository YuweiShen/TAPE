The algorithm is based on artificial curiosity and slowness principles. The paper also presents a significant improvement that is applicable to continuous environments and is demonstrated in a vision-based robot simulator. Given the focus on machine learning for robotics and computer vision, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
