This involves image processing and information extraction, which are common topics in computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and natural language processing (cs.CL). The two machine learning approaches used in the paper, Conditional Random Field and Graph Convolutional Network, are both popular in the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
