It could also belong to the sub-categories of Coding Theory (cs.CC) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) as these fields are closely related to information theory. Additionally, since the paper discusses the complexity of the decoding algorithm, it could also belong to the sub-categories of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
