The use of general-purpose planners and maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the approach using human-driven trajectories suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the application of the approach to automated driving suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
