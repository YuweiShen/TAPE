The paper focuses on jointly optimizing the offloading decisions of all users, together with the allocation of computation and communication resources, to minimize the overall cost of energy consumption, computation, and maximum delay among users. This problem involves network infrastructure, distributed computing, optimization, and communication engineering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
