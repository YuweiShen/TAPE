The scheme involves transmitting a superposition of information and noise symbols, and aligning the noise symbols at each legitimate receiver. This aligning of noise symbols is based on information theory principles, making cs.IT the most likely category.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with secure multicast, where the goal is to transmit a message to a group of receivers while keeping it confidential from eavesdroppers. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security, making cs.CR a likely category.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes a scheme for transmitting a message to a group of receivers using multiple antennas. This involves techniques such as beamforming and precoding, which are commonly used in wireless networking. Hence, cs.NI is a likely category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with transmitting a common-confidential message to a group of receivers, which can be considered as a form of multimedia communication. Hence, cs.MM is a possible category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a scheme for transmitting a message to a group of receivers using multiple antennas, which involves controlling the transmission parameters such as beamforming vectors and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
