This involves computer vision techniques such as object detection, feature extraction, and image segmentation, which are all part of the computer vision subfield (cs.CV). Additionally, the use of deep learning models for pedestrian detection and the investigation of the effect of different saliency map generation methods suggest that the paper could also belong to the subfields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the proposed method to robotics (cs.RO) is also possible, as it can be used for pedestrian detection in autonomous vehicles or robots. Finally, the use of thermal imaging technology falls under the subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR), as it involves capturing and processing data from non-visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
