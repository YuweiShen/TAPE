This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The proposed method involves oversampling and copy-pasting small objects, which can be considered as a form of data augmentation, and thus, the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO) categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on a popular dataset, MS COCO, which is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
