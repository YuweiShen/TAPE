The paper proposes a new measure called \"conductance\" to quantify the flow of attribution via hidden units. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, given that the paper focuses on the analysis of deep neural networks over image and text data, we believe that cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.NE and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
