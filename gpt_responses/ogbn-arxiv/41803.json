It proposes a tool that takes the description of a programming task and provides a comprehensive solution for the task by expanding the task description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q&A threads and performing natural language processing on the top quality answers. This involves techniques from software engineering (cs.SE), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), cybersecurity (cs.CY), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC).
