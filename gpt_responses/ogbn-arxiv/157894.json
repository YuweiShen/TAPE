This involves the use of deep networks that generate parameters for context-specific probabilistic graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. The paper focuses on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks, which are subfields of computer science that fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.CR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
