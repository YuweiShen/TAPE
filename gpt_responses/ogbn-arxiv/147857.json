Additionally, the paper deals with probabilistic programming languages (PPLs), which suggests that it could belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses refinement techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category.
