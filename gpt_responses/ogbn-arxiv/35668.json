The use of mixable loss functions and integral mixability is also a common technique in machine learning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with predicting probability distributions, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The use of mixable loss functions and integral mixability is also a common technique in artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with aggregating functional forecasts, which can be seen as a problem of information aggregation. The use of mixable loss functions and integral mixability is also related to information theory. \n4. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with probabilistic forecasts and loss functions commonly used in statistics, such as CRPS and KL divergence. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly deal with social or information networks, but the problem of online prediction with expert advice can be seen as a problem of networked decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
