This tool can potentially have a significant impact on society by making complex calculations more accessible to a wider audience.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of formulae in spreadsheets, which can be seen as a form of programming. The tool being developed is also focused on making it easier for users to program complex calculations.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a repository of rigorously tested and documented components that can be used in spreadsheets. This is a software engineering problem that involves developing a system for managing and distributing software components.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses a tool that is designed to make it easier for users to perform complex calculations in spreadsheets. This is a human-computer interaction problem that involves designing a tool that is easy to use and understand.\n- cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper does not fit neatly into any specific sub-category, but it could be considered as falling under the \"Other Computer Science\" category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
