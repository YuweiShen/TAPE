The use of deep learning approaches also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of real-time performance suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of a new online hard sample mining strategy suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
