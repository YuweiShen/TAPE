This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of mathematical crystallography and group theory suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents a search scheme to efficiently solve the decoding problem, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
