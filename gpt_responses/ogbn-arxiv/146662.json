Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses beamforming and precoding strategies, which are common in communication systems, supporting the likelihood of cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) as a second category. The paper also mentions symbol error rate (SER) performance, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses power constraints and feedback rates, which are topics in networked systems (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
