Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions the use of the method for estimating and tracking the inverse Hessian of an objective function, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
