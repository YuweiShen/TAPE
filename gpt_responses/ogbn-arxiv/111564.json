This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory sub-category.\n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the detection of signals in a multiuser MIMO system with one-bit ADCs. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Signal Processing sub-category.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a communication system where multiple users communicate with a base station. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a low-complexity wMD decoding method, which involves hierarchical code partitioning. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a multiuser MIMO system, which is often used in multimedia applications. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
