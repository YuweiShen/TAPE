Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is also a likely category. \n\nThe paper also touches on topics related to social implications of technology (cs.SI), programming languages (cs.PL), and cybernetics (cs.CY), as it discusses the impact of ad libraries on user privacy and security, and the use of permissions in programming languages.
