The paper proposes a new objective function and an adversarial training framework to improve the performance of deep neural networks for this task. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of videos, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper uses adversarial training, which is a technique commonly used in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
