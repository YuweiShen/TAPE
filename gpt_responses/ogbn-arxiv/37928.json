The paper considers transmission over both binary erasure and binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channels, and presents results for a variety of regular SC-LDPC code ensembles constructed over GF(q) using protographs. The paper also discusses the trade-off between decoding complexity and decoding latency, which suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
