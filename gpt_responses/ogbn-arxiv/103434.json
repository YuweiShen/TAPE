It also involves the use of neural models for language grounding, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper's focus on learning semantics and inference-driven pragmatics suggests that it could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of these models for referring expression games suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
