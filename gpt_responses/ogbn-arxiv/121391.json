Specifically, the paper introduces and studies various types of non-malleable extractors and codes, which are important objects in cryptography and have connections to information theory and coding theory. The paper also presents explicit constructions of these objects and their tampered extensions, which involve techniques from computational complexity and data structures. Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are all likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
