It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) because it involves processing and analyzing visual data. Additionally, it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) because it involves training networks to perform a joint task. It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because it involves developing algorithms that can communicate and cooperate to achieve a goal.
