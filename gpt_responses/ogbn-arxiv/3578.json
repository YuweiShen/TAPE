This problem involves selecting informative sensing locations based on the history of measurements acquired so far. The paper is likely to belong to the cs.AI sub-category as it involves developing intelligent agents that can learn from data. It is also likely to belong to the cs.RO sub-category as it involves developing policies for robotic exploration tasks. The paper uses machine learning techniques such as imitation learning, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also presents results on 2D and 3D exploration problems, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CV sub-category. Finally, the paper involves developing policies that can adapt to different world map distributions, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.SY sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
