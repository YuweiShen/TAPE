The use of multiple networks for parallel processing and the integration of pixel-wise semantic segmentation network also suggest that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on fast and robust detection also suggests that it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of soft-rejection based network fusion method could suggest that it could belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
