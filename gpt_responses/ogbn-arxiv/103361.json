This involves optimizing the power allocation based on users' channel conditions, which is a key aspect of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on enhancing the performance of high-rate VLC downlink networks using NOMA. This involves studying the effect of transmission angles and field of views of the receivers, which are important aspects of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a new multiple access scheme (NOMA) for VLC networks to improve the achievable data rates. This is a key aspect of communication and networking research. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the proposed power allocation strategy could potentially be optimized using machine learning techniques. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on enhancing the performance of VLC networks, which are commonly used for multimedia applications such as video streaming and indoor positioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
