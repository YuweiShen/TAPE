This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed system is distributed and requires little or no maintenance overhead, which falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with video-on-demand systems, which falls under the scope of multimedia.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes two distributed algorithms for solving the problem of helper-user topology, video storage allocation, and bandwidth allocation. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed system is adaptable to varying supply and demand patterns across multiple video channels irrespective of video popularity, which falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
