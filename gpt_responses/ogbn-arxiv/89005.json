The paper also discusses self-training and active learning strategies, which are common techniques in machine learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves exploring and improving supervised entailment systems, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper discusses creating a dataset for the clinical domain, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
