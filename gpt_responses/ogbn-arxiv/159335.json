The paper proposes a method to design communication links between controllers to restore convexity for strongly connected systems. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of systems and control, including distributed control. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): This sub-category deals with the study of systems composed of multiple interacting agents, which is relevant to the problem of distributed control. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of distributed computing systems, which is relevant to the problem of designing communication links between controllers. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the study of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are sometimes used in the context of control systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models for learning from data, which may be relevant to the problem of designing optimal distributed controllers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
