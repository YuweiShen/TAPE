This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel hierarchical, parallel and multi-scale residual architecture, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper evaluates the effect of neural network binarization on localization tasks, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
