The paper also discusses the robustness of these algorithms, which is relevant to computer security (cs.CR). The simulations involve different network architectures, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) is a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of stochastic learning algorithms, which is a common approach in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
