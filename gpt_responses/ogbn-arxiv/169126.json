This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of evolutionary algorithms also suggests a potential fit for the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and data mining (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the adaptation of a scheme to alleviate the burden of tuning parameters, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
