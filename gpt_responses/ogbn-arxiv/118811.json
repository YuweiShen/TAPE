The paper proposes a C-BiLSTM based classifier to detect help queries and a semantic Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) module to map the query to an appropriate predefined response. The paper also evaluates the system on real-world queries from a commercial IPA and compares it with popular traditional machine learning and deep learning based models. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques for IPA development. The paper also involves information retrieval and human-computer interaction, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
