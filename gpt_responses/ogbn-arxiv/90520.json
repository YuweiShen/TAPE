This involves the use of lightweight discovery protocols and scalable resource provisioning mechanisms for offloading workloads from the cloud on to the edge for servicing multiple user requests. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses distributed cloud architectures, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the minimisation of application latency, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
