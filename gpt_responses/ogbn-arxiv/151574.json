This involves the use of distributed frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark, which are commonly used in the field of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also focuses on the processing of large datasets, which is a common challenge in the field of big data and machine learning (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of these features for acoustic analysis, which involves the processing and analysis of large amounts of data (cs.CE, cs.DB). Finally, the paper includes a computational benchmark comparing the proposed system to other state-of-the-art processing tools, which is a common practice in the field of machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
