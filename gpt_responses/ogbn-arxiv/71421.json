The paper proposes a method for automatically generating search operators, which is a common topic in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The paper also discusses the use of meta-heuristic search, which is a common technique in optimization (PL) and control systems (SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using case studies, which involves experimentation and data analysis (LG). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SE, followed by cs.AI, cs.PL, cs.SY, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
