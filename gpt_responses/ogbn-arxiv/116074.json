The paper also introduces a novel notion of bisimulation for quantum processes, which involves formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The paper proposes an approximate version of the bisimulation, which involves probabilistic reasoning and complexity theory (cs.PL, cs.ET). Finally, the paper deals with the security properties of quantum protocols, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
