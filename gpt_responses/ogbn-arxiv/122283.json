The focus is on budget-feasible mechanisms, which involve constraints on the total payment made by the mechanism to the buyers. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), as the design of efficient mechanisms often involves algorithmic techniques. The paper proposes randomized and deterministic mechanisms, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), which deals with the design of intelligent agents. The paper also involves approximation algorithms, which suggests that it may be relevant to the subfield of computational complexity and algorithms (cs.EC), as well as information theory (cs.IT), which deals with the quantification and communication of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
