This involves the study of inter-symbol-interference (ISI) caused by frequency-selective fading channels, which is a key concern in communication theory and falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also considers the impact of multiuser detection, channel estimation, and transmit antenna correlations, which are important aspects of communication systems and can be studied under the categories of communication (cs.COMM), machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
