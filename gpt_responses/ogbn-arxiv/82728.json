The approach proposed involves imposing constraints on the gradient of the synthesized image to avoid visual artifacts caused by discontinuities in the source images. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following sub-categories: computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
