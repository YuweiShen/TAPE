This suggests that it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) and deep learning also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of pose and articulation in the abstract suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of part-based models and the mention of training pose-normalized CNNs suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
