Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the benefits of the proposed method in reducing over-fitting and making the model robust to occlusion, which suggests that it could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions that Random Erasing can be integrated with most CNN-based recognition models, indicating that it could be applicable to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
