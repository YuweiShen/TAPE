It involves the use of at least two steganographic methods simultaneously, which can be used to provide the steganogram with integrity and make the steganographic communication harder to detect. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses a new concept for hidden communication using steganography, which is a subfield of cryptography and security. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of multiple steganographic methods to improve hidden communication, which involves the transmission and processing of information. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of steganography in telecommunication networks, which is a subfield of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of steganography to hide information in multimedia data, such as images and videos. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the use of steganography in images, which is a subfield of computer vision and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
