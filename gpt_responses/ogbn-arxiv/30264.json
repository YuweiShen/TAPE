It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the paper focuses on improving retrieval performance in a multilingual setting. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, which makes it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the use of image data for retrieval, which could make it relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
