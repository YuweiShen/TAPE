This involves using bidirectional RNNs to share information across different relations and learning confidence scores for each rule. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves learning probabilistic logical rules and making predictions. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a scalable and differentiable approach for mining rules. \n- cs.DB (Databases) as it deals with knowledge graphs and link prediction. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it involves natural language processing and interpreting rules. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it deals with predicting links between entities in a knowledge graph."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
