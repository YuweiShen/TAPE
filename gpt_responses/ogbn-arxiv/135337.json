The paper provides a lower bound on the optimal peak rate-memory trade-off, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper studies a caching network with two receivers and a shared broadcast link, which is a typical networking scenario. The paper proposes a correlation-aware cache-aided coded multicast (CACM) scheme to alleviate the load over the shared link, which is a networking technique. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with a network with two receivers, which can be seen as a social network. The paper proposes a caching scheme that leverages the correlation among the library files, which is a social network property. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a two-step caching scheme that uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via one common and two private descriptions, which involves data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with a network that delivers files over a shared link, which can be multimedia files. The paper proposes a caching scheme that leverages the correlation among the library files, which is a multimedia property."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
