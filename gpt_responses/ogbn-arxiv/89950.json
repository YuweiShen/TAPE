The authors also mention their primary interest in stochastic chemical reaction networks, which could fall under computational biology (q-bio.QM) or other related categories. However, since the focus of the paper is on the mathematical theory of CTMCs and algorithmic randomness, we believe that the aforementioned categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
