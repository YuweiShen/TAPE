This involves formulating the problem as a Markov decision process and using historical data to derive optimal dispatching rules. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves using machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a data-driven approach using reinforcement learning. \n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) as it involves multiple agents (couriers) interacting with each other and the environment. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) as it involves optimizing the dispatching of couriers, which can be seen as a type of robot. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it involves controlling the dispatching of couriers to maximize revenue."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
