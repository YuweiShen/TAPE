The paper discusses the inapproximability of the problem, which is a topic that falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The problem is also related to data structures (cs.DS) and combinatorial optimization (cs.CG), as well as information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
