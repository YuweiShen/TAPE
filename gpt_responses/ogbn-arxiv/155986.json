The use of sparse autoencoders and convolutional neural networks also suggests the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV). The inclusion of macroeconomic variables in the feature set suggests the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) or data science (cs.DS). Finally, the use of LSTM for time series prediction suggests the category of computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
