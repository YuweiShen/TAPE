The paper also discusses the use of a graphical interface and XML format for storing protocol information, which could be considered topics related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the use of a non-relational database and plugins for different back-end verification languages could be relevant to the sub-categories of databases (cs.DB) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
