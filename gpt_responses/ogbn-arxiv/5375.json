The paper also discusses the challenges of integrating gradual typing into existing languages, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). The paper presents a new dynamic semantics for gradual typing, which involves mutable references, and discusses type safety, which are topics in logic in computer science (cs.LO) and type theory (cs.TY). Finally, the paper discusses space efficiency and run-time overhead, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
