The use of finite constellation inputs is a common constraint in digital communications, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the optimization of sum-rate achieved by precoding, which is a problem in optimization and control theory (cs.SI). The interference alignment (IA) technique is mentioned, which is a popular method in network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes algorithms for optimization, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
