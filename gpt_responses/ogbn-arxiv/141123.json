The paper also involves the study of multivariate polynomials, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper introduces a new notion of locality called the $t$-disjoint-repair-group property, which is related to distributed computing and network coding, and may be of interest to researchers in the systems and networking (cs.SI) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
