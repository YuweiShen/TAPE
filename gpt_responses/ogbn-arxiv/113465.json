This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper heavily relies on computer vision techniques such as object segmentation and pose estimation, indicating that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also emphasizes the importance of creating a system that is easy for non-experts to use, which suggests that it may belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the system on multiple industrial robots, indicating that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
