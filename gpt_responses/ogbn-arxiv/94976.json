Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of synthetic data and automatic annotation also suggests that it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the focus on mapping vehicles onto a bird's eye view suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
