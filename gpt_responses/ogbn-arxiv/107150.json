The focus on developing interpretable methods to explain machine predictions suggests a human-centered approach, which is often studied in the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the efficacy of explanations, which is a topic in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The ethical and legal concerns surrounding the use of AI in critical applications suggest a potential overlap with the sub-category of cybersecurity (cs.CY) and the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
