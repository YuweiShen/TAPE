This problem is closely related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as the platform aims to recommend an initial ranking that minimizes the time spent by the user in arriving at her desired ranking. The paper also makes theoretical contributions related to algorithms and complexity, which are relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk provide insights into user behavior and preferences, which are relevant to social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
