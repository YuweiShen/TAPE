This is a core topic in information retrieval.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper uses natural language queries and clickthrough data to generate preference judgments, which involves natural language processing techniques.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses a modified ranking SVM to learn an improved ranking function from preference data, which is a machine learning technique.\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the use of user intelligence in reformulating queries and the implications of using implicit feedback for learning to rank, which are topics related to the social and ethical aspects of computing.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper uses search engine logs to generate preference judgments, which involves analyzing user behavior in a networked environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
