The paper also proposes a new algorithm for estimating the distributions of underlying random variables, which involves techniques from probability and statistics (cs.DS). The problem of expected utility maximization is also discussed, which is related to game theory (cs.GT) and optimization (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
