The use of sparsity constraints and the recovery of signals from sub-Nyquist sampling rates are also key themes in the paper. These topics are typically studied in the following arXiv CS sub-categories: Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Multimedia (cs.MM), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Signal Processing (cs.SP). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
