Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a novel training scheme for multi-task models, which involves generating synthetic training triplets, which could fall under the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The paper also uses neural sequence-to-sequence models, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed model using automatic and human assessments, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
