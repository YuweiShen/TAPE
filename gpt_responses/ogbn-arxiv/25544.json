It focuses on exploiting the sparsity of the resulting multiple access channel, which is a common topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also deals with network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system engineering (cs.SY) aspects of 5G cellular systems. The use of beamforming techniques is a common topic in multimedia systems (cs.MM), and the paper also discusses the trade-off between the number of served FR users and the resources allocated to VR users, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
