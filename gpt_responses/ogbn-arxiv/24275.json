The use of fuzzy graphs for modeling value-related requirement dependencies suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The optimization model presented in the paper also involves decision-making, which falls under the scope of systems and control (cs.SY) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
