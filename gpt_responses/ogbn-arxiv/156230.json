This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on experimental datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of feature graphs in the proposed method also suggests that it could be relevant to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of deep SVMs, which suggests that it could be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the effect of permutations on model accuracy, which suggests that it could be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
