Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is a likely category. The paper also discusses optimization algorithms and convex optimization, which suggests cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as possible categories. The use of sparse signals and $\\ell_1$ norm indicates cs.IT (Information Theory) as another possible category.
