The paper also discusses the application of these procedures to synchronous Q-learning for Markov decision processes, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence. The use of quasi-contractive operators and cone-induced gauge norms suggests a connection to control theory and systems, which is covered by the cs.SY sub-category. The paper also discusses non-asymptotic bounds on the error, which suggests a connection to numerical analysis and optimization, covered by the cs.NE sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with discrete state-action spaces, which suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms, covered by the cs.DS sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
