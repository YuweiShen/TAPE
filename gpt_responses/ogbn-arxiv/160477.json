The paper also discusses feature extraction and metric learning techniques, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant since the paper evaluates different algorithms based on their ability to retrieve relevant information. Finally, since the paper deals with security and surveillance, it may also fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
