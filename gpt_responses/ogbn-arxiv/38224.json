Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the challenge of understanding the workings of RNNs due to their deep nature and large number of parameters, which suggests that it could also belong to the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The proposed visualization technique involves displaying the hidden states of the RNN, which could potentially involve computer vision techniques, leading to the categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
