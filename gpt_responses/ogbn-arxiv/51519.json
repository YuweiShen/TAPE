The paper also discusses the generalization error for the top ranked instances, which is a common topic in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as bipartite ranking is a common task in information retrieval. The paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories as ranking is a common task in these fields. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it proposes a new approach with improved computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
