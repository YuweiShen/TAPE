The paper also explores ways to guard AI from adversaries, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). The use of visual similarity and sequence analysis suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV), while the overall goal of achieving reliable and safe AI could also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
