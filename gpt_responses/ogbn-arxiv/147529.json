The paper also discusses scalability and bandwidth use, which are important considerations in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of artificial potential functions and other mathematical techniques for coordination and task allocation is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
