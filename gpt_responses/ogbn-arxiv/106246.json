The proposed method involves using Resblock and deconvolution layers, which are commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the problem of insufficient representation power in lower layers, which is a common issue in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves a unified prediction module, which is a type of neural network architecture commonly used in neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
