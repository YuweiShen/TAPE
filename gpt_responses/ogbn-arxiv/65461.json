The paper proposes a deep network that jointly learns local descriptors, kernel-matrix-based SPD representation, and the classifier, which involves both machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions experiments on fine-grained image recognition tasks, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses the Daleckii-Krein formula in operator theory, which is a mathematical tool commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
