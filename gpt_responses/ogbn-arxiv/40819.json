Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also extensively studies the use of deep learning models for Vietnamese NER, which could fall under sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses pre-trained word embeddings as input, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the system on a standard test set, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
