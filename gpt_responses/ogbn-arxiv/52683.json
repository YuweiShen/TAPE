The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.AI) and runtime information (cs.SY) to enhance detection capability. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results (cs.LG) to compare the performance of different anomaly detection methods. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method to process anomaly detection, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
