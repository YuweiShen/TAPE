Therefore, cs.SD is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Learning): The paper proposes a method for transferring knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource language, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to build TTS systems for low-resource languages, which falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although less likely, cs.SI is a possible sub-category as the paper discusses the challenges of data collection for TTS in low-resource languages, which can be related to social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
