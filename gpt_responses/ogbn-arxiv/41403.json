The paper proposes a novel algorithm that performs feature engineering and non-linear supervised hashing function learning, which involves deep network optimization (cs.LG) and pre-training (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed algorithm on several widely-used image benchmarks (cs.IR, cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
