This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories related to computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and deep learning (cs.DL). Among these, cs.CV is the most likely category as the paper deals with image processing and recognition of historical documents.
