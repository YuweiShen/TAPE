Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions congestion control algorithms, which are related to security and privacy (cs.CR), as well as user-space implementation of transport protocols, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The introduction of multipath capabilities at the transport layer is related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
