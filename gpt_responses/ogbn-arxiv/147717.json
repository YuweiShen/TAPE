The system also involves people tracking and filtering out improper frames, which are common tasks in robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper utilizes two vision-based algorithms for pose estimation and human detection to locate people in frames. The video summarization method also involves selecting keyframes based on representativeness and diversity, which are common tasks in computer vision. \n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to help remote family members easily be aware of their seniors' daily activities via summaries. The system's performance is evaluated through human subject studies, which are common in human-computer interaction research. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video summarization, which is a common task in multimedia research. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper utilizes vision-based algorithms for human detection and pose estimation, which are common tasks in artificial intelligence research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
