The paper specifically focuses on Sparse Regression Codes (SPARCs) for Gaussian channels and sources. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also covers algorithms and practical implementation aspects, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The third part of the paper discusses SPARCs for multi-terminal channel and source coding models, which could place it under cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
