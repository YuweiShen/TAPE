Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also considers the impact of imperfect channel estimations and user-specific power controls, which are relevant to the networking and communication systems. Hence, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is also a likely category. The paper proposes closed-form expressions to asymptotically lower-bound the spectral efficiency, which involves system-level analysis and optimization, and hence, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible category. The paper also deals with the massive MIMO and spatial modulation techniques, which are relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to optimize the number of uplink transmit antennas, which involves optimization and algorithms, and hence, cs.COM (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
