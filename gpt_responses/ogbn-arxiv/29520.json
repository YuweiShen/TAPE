The paper also introduces image and feature decomposition techniques to optimize memory access patterns for an arbitrary size of image and number of features within limited on-chip SRAM capacity. These topics are relevant to the aforementioned sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
