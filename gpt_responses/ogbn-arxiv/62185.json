It may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as it discusses the vulnerability of deep neural networks to attacks. Additionally, it could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories as it proposes a new objective function and extends previous works on black box adversarial attacks using evolution strategies and other derivative-free optimization methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
