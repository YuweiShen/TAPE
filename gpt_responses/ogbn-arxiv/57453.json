The paper discusses the technical challenges of integrating millimeter wave radios into existing networks and proposes a solution called Rapid-Link. The paper also presents empirical results showing the effectiveness of Rapid-Link in reducing beam alignment delay. Given the focus on wireless networks and communication protocols, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
