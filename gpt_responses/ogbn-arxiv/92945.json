The paper focuses on the algorithmic aspects of the framework and does not involve any experimental evaluation. Given the focus on robotics and planning, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves learning-based approaches, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely category. The paper also involves control policies and reasoning, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely category. The paper also involves multiple agents and coordination, which makes cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) a likely category. Finally, the paper involves formal methods and logic, which makes cs.LG (Logic in Computer Science) a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
