The proposed models are all based on deep learning techniques (cs.DL) and involve the use of convolutional layers (cs.LG) for feature extraction and sub-pixel convolution layers for upscaling the features. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the models in terms of OCR accuracy (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
