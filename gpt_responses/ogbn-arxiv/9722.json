This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of deep learning models also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of different datasets, which may suggest information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of histopathological imaging suggests that multimedia (cs.MM) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
