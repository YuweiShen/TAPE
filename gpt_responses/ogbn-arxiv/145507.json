The paper specifically focuses on combinatorial auctions with submodular bidders, which is a topic that falls under computational social choice (cs.GT) and algorithmic game theory (cs.GT). The paper also uses submodular functions, which are a common tool in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper's goal is to design computationally-efficient mechanisms, which involves analyzing the complexity of algorithms and protocols (cs.IT) and optimizing their performance (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
