The use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The mention of bipartite graphs and the permanent suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.GT (Graph Theory) sub-categories.
