The paper also mentions extensions to continuous state and control spaces, multiple agents, and higher-order derivatives, which are common topics in robotics and control systems research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics and Control Systems). The paper also discusses the use of simulation-based algorithms, which is a common topic in systems and control research (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of stochastic policies, which is a common topic in neural network research (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
