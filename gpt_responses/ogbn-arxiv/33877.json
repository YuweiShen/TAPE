The use of algebraic techniques and noncommutative formulas suggests that the paper may also be relevant to algebraic complexity theory (cs.LO). The study of polynomial calculus and related proof systems is related to the study of algebraic decision trees and algebraic branching programs, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of rank arguments suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the study of graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
