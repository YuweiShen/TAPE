This involves handling high-dimensional and strongly nonlinear problems, which are common in machine learning and artificial intelligence research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper also discusses the application of the proposed CNN metamodel to IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA)-based optimization, which falls under the sub-category cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Finally, the use of analytical functions for testing the CNN metamodel suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
