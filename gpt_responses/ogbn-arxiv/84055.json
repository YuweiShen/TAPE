The paper also discusses the vulnerability of existing distance metrics to adversarial examples, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes a methodology for defending against adversarial attacks, which involves training a metric-preserving network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves experiments and benchmarking, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
