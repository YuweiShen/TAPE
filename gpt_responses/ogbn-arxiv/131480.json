The proposed method of using deep recurrent neural networks for state estimation is also commonly used in robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the use of inertial sensors for localization is often combined with visual data to improve accuracy. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of deep recurrent neural networks for state estimation, which is a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for state estimation falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of drift in inertial odometry, which is a common problem in systems and control. The proposed method of segmenting data into independent windows and estimating latent states can also be seen as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
