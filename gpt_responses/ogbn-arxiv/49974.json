The paper also proposes a solution that involves modifying the Android operating system, which could be classified as a software engineering (cs.SE) or systems and control (cs.SY) topic. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Quire mechanisms for validating client-side behavior, which could be related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation details of AdSplit, which involves recompiling apps and avoiding the need for ads to have native code, which could be classified as programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
