It focuses on the use of cooperative NOMA without requiring accurate channel-state information at the base station. This topic falls under the broad category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses algorithms for power allocation and user fairness, which are related to system optimization (cs.SY) and communication protocols (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper extends the proposed technique to a multiuser scenario, which involves multiple access techniques (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
