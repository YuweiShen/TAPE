The paper discusses the computational modelling of receptive fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1) in biological vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the transfer of the theory to a discrete implementation in terms of recursive filters over time, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the analysis of the resulting temporal dynamics, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computation of scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative expressions for spatio-temporal feature detection, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the parameterization of the intermediate temporal scale levels, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
