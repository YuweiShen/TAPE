Information theory is closely related to the study of capacity and transmission schemes, making this category a likely fit.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The proposed scheme involves transmitting multiple signals simultaneously to both cell center and cell edge users, which is a networking and communication problem. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper focuses on improving the capacity of downlink transmission, which is a core problem in communication and networking. \n4. cs.PHYS (Physics and Society) - The use of OAM-based mode division multiple access involves the manipulation of electromagnetic waves, which is a physical phenomenon. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed scheme involves the design and implementation of a new transmission scheme, which can be considered a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
