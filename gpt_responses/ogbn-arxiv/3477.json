The focus on communication reduction and reshuffling of data suggests a connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems). The study of complexity for conjunctive queries and distribution policies suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
