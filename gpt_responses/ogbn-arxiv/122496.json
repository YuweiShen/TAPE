The paper also discusses the impact of manipulating input data on the clustering process, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The case study on clustering of malware samples and handwritten digits suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
