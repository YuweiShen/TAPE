The proposed sequence estimation technique is based on sphere decoding (SD), which is a common technique used in wireless communication systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the potential benefits of FTN signaling in terms of data rate and spectral efficiency, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
