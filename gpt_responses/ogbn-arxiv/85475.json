The paper also discusses the use of simulated annealing as a way to perform hyper-parameter tuning. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques, which suggests the possibility of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as potential sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
