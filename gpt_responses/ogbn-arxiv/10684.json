The paper also mentions constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and group CSPs, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The use of group theory in the CSPs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of hard instances for graph isomorphism, which could be considered a topic in algorithmic graph theory (cs.DS) or logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
