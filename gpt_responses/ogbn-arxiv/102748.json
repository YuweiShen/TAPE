The paper also discusses the behavior of the algorithm over graphs with heavy-tailed degree distributions, which is a defining feature of real-world graphs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
