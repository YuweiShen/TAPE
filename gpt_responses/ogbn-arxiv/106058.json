It proposes a joint successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection technique and a multi-relay selection algorithm. This work involves information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the detection and selection of signals in a noisy environment. It also involves networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it deals with cooperative communication among multiple relays. The paper also involves systems and control (cs.SY) as it proposes a cross-layer design strategy. Additionally, it involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it uses RAKE receivers for front-end processing. Finally, it involves computer communication (cs.COM) as it deals with communication protocols and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
