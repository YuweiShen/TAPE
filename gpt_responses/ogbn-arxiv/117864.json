The use of large-scale antenna arrays and linear processing also suggests that this paper could fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions massive MIMO (cs.MM), which is a subfield of wireless communication that involves using a large number of antennas at the base station. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed power allocation scheme through simulations, which could fall under the category of computer networking and internet architecture (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
