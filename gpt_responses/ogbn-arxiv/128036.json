Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the mean-square errors (MSE) of the Gaussian approximation (GA)-based multi-user detection (MUD), which suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of optimized codes, which could indicate that it belongs to the Network and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
