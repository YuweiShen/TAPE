The paper provides improved running times and oracle complexities for this problem, which suggests that it is likely to be relevant to the areas of data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
