The use of non-Gaussian and state-dependent noise is also a common topic in information theory and control systems, suggesting cs.IT and cs.SY as likely sub-categories. The study of non-convex potential functions is relevant to numerical analysis and scientific computing, suggesting cs.NA as a possible sub-category. Finally, the application of the theoretical findings to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for training deep neural networks suggests cs.AI as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
