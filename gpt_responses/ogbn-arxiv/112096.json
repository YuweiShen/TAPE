This involves the use of orthogonal random codes, linear precoding, and channel statistical information. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. The paper also involves communication networks (cs.COMM), as it deals with multiuser transmission. The use of linear precoding and channel statistical information suggests the sub-categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper involves signal processing (cs.MM), as it deals with space-time-frequency joint block coding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
