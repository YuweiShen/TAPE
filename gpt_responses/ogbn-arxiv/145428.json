Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of blockages on the network, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of millimeter wave technology is also discussed, which could be classified under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also presents a quantitative evaluation of the IEEE 802.11ad devices, which involves measuring link alignment and association overheads, and this could be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the use of intelligent handoff to alternate APs, which could be classified under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
