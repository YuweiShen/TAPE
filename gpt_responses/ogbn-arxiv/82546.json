It introduces the private function retrieval (PFR) problem and characterizes the fundamental limits of the communication cost. The problem involves retrieving a linear function of K messages from N non-communicating replicated servers while keeping the function hidden from each individual server. This problem is related to private information retrieval (PIR), which is a well-studied problem in the field of cryptography and information theory. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the fundamental limits of the communication cost for the PFR problem, which is a problem related to information theory. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses privacy concerns in distributed computing systems and proposes a scheme to keep the function hidden from each individual server. This makes it relevant to the field of cryptography and security. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The PFR problem involves retrieving a function from multiple servers, which is a problem related to distributed computing. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper proposes an achievable scheme for the PFR problem, which involves finding a solution with minimum communication cost. This makes it relevant to the field of computational complexity. \n- cs.DS (Data"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
