This involves solving complex ill-posed inverse models against the available state-variable data records. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper extensively uses unsupervised learning based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to decompose the recorded mixtures and find the number of unknown sources. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves solving complex ill-posed inverse models against the available state-variable data records, which requires numerical analysis techniques. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper deals with identifying release sources in an advection-diffusion system, which is a problem in computational science and engineering. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses machine learning techniques to identify the unknown number, locations, and properties of various sets of synthetic release sources. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not deal explicitly with social or information networks, the method presented can be applied directly to any problem controlled by a partial"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
