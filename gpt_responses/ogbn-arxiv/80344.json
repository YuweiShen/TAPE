This falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO). The proposed method involves unifying different levels of representation in a single planner, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of additional semantics to compensate for the loss of information in coarser representations, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with planning for a robot, which suggests the use of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
