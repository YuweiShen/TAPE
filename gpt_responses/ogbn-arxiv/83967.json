The paper focuses on the practical implementation of the IRS with finite-resolution phase shifters, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The optimization problem involves minimizing transmit power subject to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of multi-antenna access points (AP) and single-antenna users, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Overall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
