The paper discusses a crowdsourcing method for labeling data, which is a common topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method is designed to be budget efficient, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY). The paper also mentions using standard aggregation methods, which could be related to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with datasets with both categorical and continuous labels, which could be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
