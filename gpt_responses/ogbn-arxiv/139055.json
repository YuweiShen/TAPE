The paper also discusses modern coding theory and recent advances in coding for symmetric channels, which are topics in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper mentions polar codes and spatially coupled codes, which are commonly used in the field of signal processing and communications (cs.SI). The paper also discusses source coding and channel coding, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS).
