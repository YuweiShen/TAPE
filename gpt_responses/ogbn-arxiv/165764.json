The paper also discusses the application of coalgebras to continuous dcpos and stably continuous frames, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of coalgebras for diagonalization of endomaps is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
