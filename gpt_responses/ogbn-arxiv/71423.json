The paper also discusses the use of ReLU activation functions, which are commonly used in deep learning models. Additionally, the paper proposes a data-dependent initialization method, which is a common technique used in machine learning to improve model performance. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it specifically focuses on the properties of over-parameterized neural networks. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it discusses the effectiveness of neural networks in various applications. \n\nThe computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category is also a possibility as neural networks are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. \n\nFinally, the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses the properties of neural networks and their effectiveness in various applications, which can be considered as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
