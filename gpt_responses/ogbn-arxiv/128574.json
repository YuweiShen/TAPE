This problem is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) due to the use of fast embedding techniques involving Fourier transform. The paper also discusses the theoretical results and optimization techniques used in the embedding process, which falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
