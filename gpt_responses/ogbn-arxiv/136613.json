This problem is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as it involves the transmission and compression of information. It also involves networked systems (cs.NI), as the messages are stored and transmitted across multiple servers. The paper proposes a new coding scheme for distributed index coding, which involves the partitioning of servers, and establishes new outer bounds on the capacity region. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed scheme on a set of non-isomorphic distributed index coding problems, which involves the analysis of achievable rates and capacity. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
