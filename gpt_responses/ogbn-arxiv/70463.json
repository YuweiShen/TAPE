This involves retrieving online bibliographic data and conducting longitudinal analyses to interpret and visualize the data. The paper does not focus on any specific computer science subfield, but rather presents a general approach that could be applied to various fields. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
