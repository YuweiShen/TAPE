The use of convolutional neural networks also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of geodesic coordinate maps suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO) and the use of principal curvature as an indicator of planar boundaries suggests a possible connection to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
