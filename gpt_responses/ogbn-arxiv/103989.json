It also involves the use of defining sets, which is a concept in coding theory (cs.CR). The construction technique may involve algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper may also involve the analysis of the properties of the constructed information sets (cs.SI) and the potential applications of the technique in error-correcting codes (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
