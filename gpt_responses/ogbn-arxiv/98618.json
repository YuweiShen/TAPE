This makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of limit order book data for financial time series forecasting suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Data Science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for addressing the challenges of combining BoF with deep feature extractors, which could make it relevant to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
