The specific problems studied in the paper, such as Minimum Fill-In and Interval Completion, are related to chordal graphs, which fall under the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category. The use of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs) also suggests a connection to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category.
