The paper also extensively evaluates the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic datasets, indicating a focus on practical applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory) for the analysis of error guarantees, cs.DB (Databases) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) for the applications in data processing, and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) for the potential use in network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
