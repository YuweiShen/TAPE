The use of narrative theory as a framework for identifying links between social media content suggests that this paper belongs to the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of crowdsourcing tasks to generate summaries of events suggests that this paper may also belong to the categories of social computing (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.SD), cybernetics (cs.CY), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
