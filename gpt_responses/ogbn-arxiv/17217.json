Moreover, the paper mentions the use of Sperner's lemma, which is a well-known tool in combinatorial game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The problem of rental harmony can be seen as a resource allocation problem, which is a common topic in AI research. The paper also mentions the use of optimization techniques to solve the problem. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of a variant of Sperner's lemma to solve the problem of rental harmony, which is a combinatorial problem. This makes it relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The problem of rental harmony can be seen as a multi-agent optimization problem, which is a common topic in machine learning research.
