The paper also discusses the use of inductive learning to automatically generate abstractions for generalized planning, which falls under the subfield of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the use of first-order formulas to obtain guarantees for generalization, which is related to the subfield of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of automated synthesis of complex invariants for planning problems, which is related to the subfield of data structures (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
