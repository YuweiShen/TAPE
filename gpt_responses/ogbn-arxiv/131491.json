The application of the method is in the medical field, specifically for multiple myeloma, which suggests the medical imaging (cs.MED) category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of a UNet-inspired architecture, which is a popular deep learning model for image segmentation, indicating the deep learning (cs.DL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
