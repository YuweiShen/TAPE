The paper also discusses the use of AllReduce operations, which are commonly used in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also considers network latency and bandwidth, which are important factors in networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes a pipelined training approach, which involves breaking up the training process into stages, a technique that is commonly used in distributed systems and parallel computing (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a GPU cluster, which is a type of distributed system used for high-performance computing (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
