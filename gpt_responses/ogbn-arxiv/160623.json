The paper focuses on active model adaptation, which involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a new task using a small set of labeled examples. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers related to machine learning, which is the main focus of this paper. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers related to computer vision, which is one of the main applications of DNNs. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers related to artificial intelligence, which is a broader field that includes machine learning. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers papers related to natural language processing, which is another application of DNNs. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers related to neural networks, which is the underlying technology behind DNNs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
