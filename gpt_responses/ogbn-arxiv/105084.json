Computer vision techniques are used to extract features from the sensor data collected by the smart devices.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the use of smart devices and wearables by vulnerable road users to communicate with intelligent vehicles and other traffic participants. The proposed approach aims to improve the safety of cyclists by detecting their starting movements and warning vehicles of their presence.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The detection of starting movements is modelled as a classification problem and realized by means of a machine learning classifier. The paper proposes a novel two-stage feature selection procedure and introduces an auxiliary class to improve the robustness and reduce the detection time of the classifier.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of smart devices to detect intentions of vulnerable road users, such as an occluded cyclist intending to cross the road. This can be seen as a form of information retrieval, where relevant information about the intentions of road users is extracted from sensor data.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the communication between smart devices and intelligent vehicles, which can be seen as a form of networking. The proposed approach aims to improve the cooperation between different traffic participants, such as in cooperative intention detection for advanced VR"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
