The paper also involves Fourier analysis, which is a common technique in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) since it deals with the capacity region of MACs. The paper also involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which are relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
