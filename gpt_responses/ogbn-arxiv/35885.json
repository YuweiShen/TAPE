This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it involves protecting information from unauthorized access. The paper also involves natural language processing techniques such as wordlists and similarity scores, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper involves text processing and manipulation, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves image steganography as a comparison to the proposed text steganography approaches, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
