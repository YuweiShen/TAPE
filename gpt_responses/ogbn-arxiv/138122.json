The paper specifically focuses on the sparsity of input polynomials and mixed systems, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.SY (Systems and Control), or cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
