The paper also considers the effects of channel coherence time and spatial fading correlation, which are related to signal processing and statistical inference (cs.SI). The analysis involves the use of formulae for ergodic capacity and cutoff rate, which are relevant to networked systems and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper derives general formulae that encompass all previously known results, which is a contribution to mathematical analysis and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
