This falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses micro-architectural and ISA extensions, which are related to Computer Architecture (cs.AR) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The proposed method can also have applications in Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
