This is a relevant topic in computational geometry, which deals with algorithms and data structures for geometric problems.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Networks are a common type of data in social and information networks research, and the paper focuses on visualizing them. The mapper on graphs approach can be useful for analyzing and understanding network structures, which is a key topic in this sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper provides a software tool for interactive exploration of graph summaries, which is a relevant topic in software engineering. The tool can be used for developing and testing graph visualization algorithms and interfaces.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The mapper on graphs approach involves constructing a summary of a graph while preserving its core structures, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the method and provides experimental results on synthetic and real-world data.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The mapper on graphs approach is based on topological data analysis, which is a field that combines algebraic topology and discrete mathematics. The paper discusses the theoretical foundations of the method and its application to graph visualization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
