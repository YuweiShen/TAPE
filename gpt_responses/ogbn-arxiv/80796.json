Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the challenges of implementing distance bounding systems with low-power provers, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and backscatter communication indicates that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
