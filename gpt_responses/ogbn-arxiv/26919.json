The specific focus on bandwidth limitations and the CONGEST model suggests that Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Computer Communication Networks (cs.NI) may also be relevant sub-categories. The use of graph theory and algorithms suggests that Computational Complexity (cs.CC) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the potential implications for various settings of distributed computing suggest that Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
