Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nAdditionally, the paper deals with the communication aspect of FL, specifically in mobile edge networks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe proposed scheduling policy takes into account the instantaneous channel qualities, which indicates that it could also be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the implementation of FL, which could also make it relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
