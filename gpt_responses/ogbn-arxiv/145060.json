This problem is primarily related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it involves optimizing the use of wireless channels for data transmission. The proposed approach also leverages deep learning techniques to achieve the objectives, which makes it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper specifically focuses on mmWave systems, which is a sub-field of multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with high-frequency wireless communication for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
