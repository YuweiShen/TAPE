It also involves Boolean functions, which are commonly studied in cryptography (cs.CR) and complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the weight distribution of the codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents applications of the construction using specific types of Boolean functions, which could fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
