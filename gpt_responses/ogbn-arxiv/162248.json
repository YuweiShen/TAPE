Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the improvement of the approach commonly used in practice, which is related to the field of machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The proposed method involves the selection and rotation of activation functions, which is a common technique in the field of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another possible sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of the proposed method for complex target functions, which is related to computer vision and pattern recognition, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method to control systems, which is related to the field of systems and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
