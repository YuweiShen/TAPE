Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also fine-tunes a BERT embedding for estimating probabilities, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The task of ranking instances in the image can be considered a machine learning problem, which is covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
