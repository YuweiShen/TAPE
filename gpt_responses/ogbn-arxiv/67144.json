The paper specifically focuses on LSH for the angular distance, which is a metric commonly used in computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are likely categories. The paper also discusses experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data sets, which suggests that it may belong to cs.DB. Finally, the paper introduces a lower bound for the quality of any LSH family for angular distance, which suggests that it may belong to cs.DS and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
