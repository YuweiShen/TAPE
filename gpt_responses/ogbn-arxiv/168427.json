The paper also focuses on a specific precision medicine problem, which suggests that it could belong to the computational biology (cs.CE) sub-category. The proposed method uses stacked auto-encoders for feature representation, which suggests that it could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses deep learning to identify significant risk factors, which suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
