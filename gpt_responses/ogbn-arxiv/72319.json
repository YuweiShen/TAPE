The use of side information and the focus on scalar-linear settings suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the practical applications of the problem, such as retrieving items from a server, may also make it relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
