The use of data registers and numerical aggregates also suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS). The logical characterization of the streamable regular transductions using MSO-definable transformations suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO), while the study of closure properties suggests a connection to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
