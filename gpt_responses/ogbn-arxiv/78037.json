The algorithm is designed for use in embedded systems, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper specifically deals with image encryption, which suggests that it may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper uses statistical analysis to break the encryption scheme, which suggests that it may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
