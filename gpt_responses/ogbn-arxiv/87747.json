The use of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
