The paper also discusses the challenge of concept drift in time-series data, which is a common issue in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistics (cs.ST). The method proposed in the paper involves sparse Gaussian processes, which is a technique used in machine learning for reducing the computational complexity of Gaussian processes and falls under the category of \"Signal Processing\" (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Q-function for adapting to concept drift, which is a technique used in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
