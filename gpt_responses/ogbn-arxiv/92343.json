The use of anonymous oblivious modules and the consideration of the effect of global compass on the minimum number of modules necessary suggest that this paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The analysis of the number of possible shapes of the robotic system and its memory function may also relate to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
