The paper analyzes the ergodic sum-rate, outage probability, and outage capacity of the proposed D2D-NOMA system, which are all related to information theory and communication systems. The paper also considers different decoding strategies, which are related to networking and internet architecture. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
