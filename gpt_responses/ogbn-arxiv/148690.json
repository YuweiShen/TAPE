The paper proposes a framework for interactive teaching of virtual borders to mobile robots, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of human-robot interaction and control, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The implementation of the virtual borders is based on visual markers, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The approach is also flexible and less time-consuming, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
