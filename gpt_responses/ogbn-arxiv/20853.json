This is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and constraint programming (cs.CC). The use of among constraints is related to counting and combinatorial optimization, which are also relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the paper presents a domain flow-based filtering algorithm, which is a technique used in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
