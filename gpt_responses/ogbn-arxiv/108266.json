Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.GR (Graphics). The paper also discusses the benefits of the system in terms of user experience and navigation, which suggests a potential fit for cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper involves data streaming and visualization, which could be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
