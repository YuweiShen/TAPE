The use of weighted means and the quasi-arithmetic $\\alpha$-divergences suggest a connection to optimization and decision-making, which are also relevant to data science (cs.DS). The paper's focus on generalizations and subfamilies of existing divergence measures may also be of interest to researchers in statistics (cs.SI) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
