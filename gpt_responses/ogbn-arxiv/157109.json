It also involves compressive sensing (cs.IT) which is a technique used in signal processing and data compression. The paper also discusses hardware and sensor placement (cs.OH) which is relevant to the field of computer engineering. Additionally, the paper mentions remote sensing (cs.MM) which involves the use of sensors and imaging in remote or inaccessible locations. Finally, the paper discusses algorithms for optimized active illumination patterns (cs.SI) which is a sub-category related to signal processing and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
