This is a topic that falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The use of numerical analysis techniques suggests a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the focus on precision in the widening operator suggests a connection to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
