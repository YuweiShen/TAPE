This falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and swarm robotics (cs.RO). The paper also examines the sensory abilities of the simulated individuals, which relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper perturbs many of the model's basic parameters, which falls under the category of simulation and modeling (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
