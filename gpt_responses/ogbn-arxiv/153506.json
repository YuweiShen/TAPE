The use of fly-automata suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The concept of recognizability is related to computational complexity and algorithms (cs.CC), while the application of MSO logic to graph properties suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
