Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses theoretical principles and resource control of NOMA, which are related to information theory and communication technologies, respectively. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions cooperative transmission and the co-existence of NOMA with other emerging 5G techniques, which are related to system design and integration, respectively. Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions advanced multimedia applications, such as ultra-high-definition video and virtual reality, which are related to multimedia technologies. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
