The paper proposes an improved metric for performance evaluation and a robust iterative interference alignment algorithm for addressing this problem. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), network infrastructure (cs.NI), control systems (cs.SY), multimedia systems (cs.MM), and computer engineering (cs.CE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
