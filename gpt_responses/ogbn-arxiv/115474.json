The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Hybrid State Systems (HSS), which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the application of the framework to vehicle safety systems, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of computer vision techniques for data collection, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
