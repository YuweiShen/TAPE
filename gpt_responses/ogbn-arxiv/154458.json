The paper discusses the use of deep neural networks and multi-view consistency to improve semantic mapping. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of SLAM for obtaining camera trajectory, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of multi-scale loss minimization and deep feature pooling, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the NYUDv2 benchmark for semantic segmentation, which is a common dataset used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
