This involves signal processing, wireless communication, and network optimization, which are all relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a scheme that builds a bridge between the radio channel and physical signal propagation environment, which involves system modeling and control, making the paper relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme using simulations, which involves modeling and simulation, making the paper relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
