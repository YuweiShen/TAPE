The paper also discusses knowledge distillation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to reduce the size of neural models. The paper mentions the use of weight pruning, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) to reduce the size of neural networks. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the student model, which is trained using sequence-level knowledge distillation, and compares it to the teacher model using BLEU score, which is a metric commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
