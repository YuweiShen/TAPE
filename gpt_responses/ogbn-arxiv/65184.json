This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the achievable rates of these codes and their decoding complexity, which are relevant to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper applies the analysis to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which are a specific type of error-correcting codes and fall under the scope of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
