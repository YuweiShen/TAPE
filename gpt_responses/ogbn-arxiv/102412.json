The use of utilities to determine dynamic spacings is related to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control theory (cs.SY). The algorithm proposed in the paper involves distributed control, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the theoretical analysis and experimental results presented in the paper involve machine learning techniques, which are also related to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
