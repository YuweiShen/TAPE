This falls under the scope of robotics.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the orchestration of tasks for multiple vehicles, which involves control and coordination of the vehicles. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions event-based task flow, which could involve the use of AI techniques for decision-making and planning.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper describes the implementation of the Dolphin language as a Groovy DSL, which involves software engineering principles and practices.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper presents a new programming language, Dolphin, for task orchestration in autonomous vehicle networks.
