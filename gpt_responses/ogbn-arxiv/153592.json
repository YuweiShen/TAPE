It also discusses the tradeoff between efficiency and implementation effort, which is relevant to optimization and logic programming (cs.LO). The use of tabled evaluation is often associated with artificial intelligence applications (cs.AI). The paper also discusses implementation and maintenance efforts, which are relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper presents performance results, which are often associated with data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
