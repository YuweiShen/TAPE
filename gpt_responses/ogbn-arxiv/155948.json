This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) domain. The proposed solution involves a hallucination module that approximates missing modalities during testing, which requires a machine learning approach. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) domains. The paper also incorporates knowledge distillation, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) domains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
