This involves designing custom beam pairs and developing a multi-layer reference signal structure. Information theory concepts are likely to be used in the analysis and optimization of the proposed method. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with signal processing techniques for millimeter-wave MIMO systems, which are used in various multimedia applications such as high-speed data transmission, virtual reality, and augmented reality. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed method can be used in wireless networks that employ millimeter-wave MIMO systems, which are expected to play a key role in future 5G and beyond networks. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel differential feedback strategy to reduce feedback in closed-loop frequency division duplexing systems. This involves designing a control system that can estimate the angle pairs and provide feedback to the transmitter. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): Although this is less likely, the paper may involve natural language processing techniques for analyzing and interpreting the results of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
