It also involves sampling algorithms, which are commonly used in IR. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category as top-k MIPS is a central task in many machine learning applications. \n\nThe Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category is also a possibility as the paper proposes algorithmic engineering techniques to deploy wedge sampling on budgeted top-k MIPS. \n\nThe Database (cs.DB) category is another possibility as the paper deals with retrieving top-k results from a large dataset. \n\nFinally, the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category is a possibility as top-k MIPS is used in image retrieval and object recognition tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
