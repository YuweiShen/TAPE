The paper proposes a new scenario for continual learning and proposes a new algorithm for this scenario. The paper also discusses related work in the fields of meta-learning, online learning, and knowledge accumulation, which are all subfields of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
