Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The method also involves using learned proposals and regression, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), making cs.AI and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions achieving competitive performances on public benchmarks, indicating a focus on evaluation and comparison, which falls under information retrieval (IR) and computational linguistics (CL), making them less likely but still possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
