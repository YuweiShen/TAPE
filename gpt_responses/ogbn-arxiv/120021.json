The use of Residual Networks (ResNets) also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of spatiotemporal networks suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves training the model end-to-end, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep architectures and hierarchical learning suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
