However, the focus on MIMO wiretap channels and the use of random matrix theory suggest that the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with cryptography and network security, which are topics covered by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), respectively. The optimization problem addressed in the paper falls under the scope of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
