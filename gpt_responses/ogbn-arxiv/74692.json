The paper also discusses the need for private parameter tuning to ensure differential privacy, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The authors propose a principled tuning mechanism that involves error bounds, which is related to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also involves experimentation to demonstrate the practicality of achieving end-to-end privacy, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves theoretical results that establish privacy and utility, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
