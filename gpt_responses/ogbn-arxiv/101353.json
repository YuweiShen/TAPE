The paper also establishes a connection between multi-agent systems and Hamiltonian dynamics, which is a topic that falls under control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses online learning dynamics, which is a topic that falls under neural networks (cs.NE).
