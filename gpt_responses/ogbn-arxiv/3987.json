The paper also explores transmitter cooperation, which is a common topic in the field of networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the interference channel, which is a common topic in the field of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the X and Z channels, which are specific types of multiuser MIMO channels and are therefore relevant to the field of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the cost of enabling transmitter cooperation, which is a topic that falls under the umbrella of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
