The paper also discusses the use of Expectation-Maximization (EM) based approach, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a new method for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, which involves learning from image-level labels, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of saliency and attention maps, which are common techniques in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM). Overall, the paper is likely to belong to cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
