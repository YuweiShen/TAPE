The paper also discusses linear coding strategies and transmission strategies, which are relevant to networked information systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves multiple antennas and multiple receivers, which are topics in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the DoF region, which is a topic in communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
