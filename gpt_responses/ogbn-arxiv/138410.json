Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also presents algorithms that run in linear time, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of grids and orthogonal edges in the algorithms suggests that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GR (Graphics), respectively. Finally, the implications in VLSI design suggest that it could belong to cs.CC (Computing and Communication)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
