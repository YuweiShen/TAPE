The dataset construction and annotation process involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques, and the experimental study compares state-of-the-art methods, which is a common practice in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) research. Additionally, the problem of video retrieval has applications in security and surveillance (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
