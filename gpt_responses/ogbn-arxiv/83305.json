Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) which deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from data. Additionally, the paper proposes a scheme for releasing sensitive information privately, which falls under the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the application of the methodology to learning fair predictors in settings where protected attributes are only available for a subset of the data, which could fall under the sub-categories of Cybersecurity (cs.CY) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides theoretical guarantees on the performance of the adapted learners, which could fall under the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
