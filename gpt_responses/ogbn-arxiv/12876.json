The study also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it investigates the feasibility of key press inference attacks on handheld numeric touchpads. The use of motion sensors in smartwatches and smartphones for the attack also relates to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also touches on the topic of cybersecurity (cs.CY) as it discusses the additional attack surface provided by the diverse set of on-board sensors in smartwatches. Finally, the study involves the use of machine learning techniques for inference, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
