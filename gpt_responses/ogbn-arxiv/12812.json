The paper also discusses the use of visual localization in autonomous vehicles (cs.RO) and augmented reality applications (cs.GR). The evaluation of state-of-the-art localization approaches involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) and the authors propose future work on improving local features, which is a common topic in computer vision and machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
