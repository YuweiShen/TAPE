The use of moment generating function (MGF) technique suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The focus on fading channels and maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) receivers suggests that the paper may also belong to the Communication (cs.COMM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The use of mathematical formalism and numerical examples suggests that the paper may also belong to the Mathematical Aspects of Computer Science (cs.MA) and Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
