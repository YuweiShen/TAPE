The use of constraints and obstacles in the routing problem suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of competitive routing strategies suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of game theory (cs.GT) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
