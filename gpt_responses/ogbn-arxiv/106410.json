This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as the focus is on robot navigation. The paper also uses natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) to process the instructions and deep reinforcement learning (cs.AI) to learn the policies. The use of attention mechanisms (cs.LG) and visual inputs (cs.CV) further supports these likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
