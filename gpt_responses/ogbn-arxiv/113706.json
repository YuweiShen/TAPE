Additionally, the paper proposes a novel normalization method and discusses its theoretical analysis and experimental results, indicating that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves the analysis of gradients, which suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
