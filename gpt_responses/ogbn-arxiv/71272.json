The use of the polynomial coefficient matrix and its maximum rank is a technique from linear algebra and algebraic geometry, which suggests categories such as cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.SC (symbolic computation). The results also involve matrix multiplication and tensor products, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper uses techniques such as product-sparse formulas and partitioned arithmetic branching programs, which are related to logic and algebra (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
