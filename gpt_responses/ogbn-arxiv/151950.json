The paper also focuses on the dynamical features of the input driving time series, which falls under the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the readout mapping from the state space, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
