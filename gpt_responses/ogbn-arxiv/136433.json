This is a core topic in formal languages and automata theory.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses algorithms for solving min-cost problems for the classes of functions specified in their model. This is a core topic in data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) - The paper uses the theory of string-to-tree transducers to define regularity and allows associating costs with events that are conditional upon regular properties of future events. This is a topic in logic in computer science.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper studies decision problems and theoretical properties of resulting classes of cost functions. This is a topic in computational complexity.\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes a model of cost register automata that allows computation of regular functions using multiple \"write-only\" registers whose values can be combined using the allowed set of operations. This is a topic in programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
