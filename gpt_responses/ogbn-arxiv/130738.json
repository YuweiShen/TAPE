The use of deep convolution neural network and RPN also suggests that the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, remote sensing images are often used in geographic information systems (GIS) and mapping applications, which could place the paper in the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of region of interests (ROIs) for object detection is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO), which could also be a potential sub-category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
