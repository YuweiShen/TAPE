The use of monotone, rank-based rewards and the modeling of endogenous entry also suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CY). The analysis of participation probabilities and quality distribution involves data analysis and statistical methods, which could be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper addresses the design of incentives for different kinds of rewards in crowdsourcing, which could be related to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
