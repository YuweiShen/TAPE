It could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) due to the use of a computational model. Additionally, the study involves human participants and eye-tracking technology, which suggests a potential fit with the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of a computational model to explain the results of the eye-tracking study could also place this paper in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
