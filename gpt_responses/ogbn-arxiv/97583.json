The paper also discusses the use of novel multi-phase precoding schemes, which could fall under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper considers the impact of imperfect CSI on the system performance, which could be relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) as a performance metric, which is a concept commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the different settings and scenarios in which the problem is analyzed, which could be relevant to the field of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
