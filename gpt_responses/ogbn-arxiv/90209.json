The use of selective combining decode-and-forward (SC-DF) relay networks also suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI). The analysis of outage probability and symbol error probability involves statistical analysis and probability theory, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the optimization problem and analytical solutions suggest a focus on mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
