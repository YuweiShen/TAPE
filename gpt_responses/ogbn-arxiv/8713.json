Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their achievable rates, making this category the most likely fit for this paper. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a communication system that can be applied to wireless networks, making this category a likely fit. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system that combines different coding techniques to improve the performance of a communication system, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a communication system that can be used to transmit multimedia data, making this category a possible fit. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a communication system that can be applied to networked systems, making this category a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
