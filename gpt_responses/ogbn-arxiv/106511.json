The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable scene text recognition system that iteratively removes perspective distortion and text line curvature. This involves developing an innovative rectification network that estimates the pose of text lines in scenes and an iterative rectification pipeline that corrects scene text distortions iteratively towards a fronto-parallel view. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This is the most likely category as the paper deals with a problem in computer vision and proposes a deep learning-based solution. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves recognizing text in scenes, which is a problem in information retrieval. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with recognizing text in scenes, which is a problem in natural language processing. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable system that uses deep learning, which falls under the category of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based solution for recognizing text in scenes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
