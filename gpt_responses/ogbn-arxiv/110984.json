The paper also focuses on making the system low power, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM). The use of a dedicated accelerator with programmable logic suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). The hybrid dataflow approach and column-prior tiling strategy are techniques commonly used in signal processing and optimization, which could place the paper under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of deep learning and quantization suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
