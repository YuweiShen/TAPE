The use of hardware and algorithms to improve performance also falls under computer engineering (cs.CE). The paper also mentions the need for security in graph analysis systems, which falls under cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of graph analysis in networking and communication systems falls under networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
