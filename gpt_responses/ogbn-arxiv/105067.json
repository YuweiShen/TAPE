Additionally, the paper proposes a method for personal calibration, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of deep learning models also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of 3D gaze estimation, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
