The use of a single-antenna channel and the investigation of the impact of feedback delay suggest a focus on networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The study of the ergodic and outage performance also involves the evaluation of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
