The paper also introduces a new metric for evaluating distances between Mapper graphs, which involves topological data analysis (cs.DS) and network analysis (cs.SI). The use of optimal transport in the metric also suggests a potential connection to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the application of the metric to anomaly detection in dynamic graphs involves neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
