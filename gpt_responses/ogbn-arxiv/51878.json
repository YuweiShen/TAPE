The paper also proposes a subsidy structure to overcome this problem, which can be analyzed using game theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the adoption of network services and the impact of network externality on adoption. The paper also discusses the role of subscription cost and subsidy in facilitating adoption. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the impact of network externality on adoption and how it can be overcome using cost subsidization. The paper also discusses the role of user heterogeneity in adoption. \n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of cost subsidization on the adoption of network services and its implications for the service provider and users. The paper also discusses the efficiency of different subsidy levels. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the adoption of network services and the impact of network externality on adoption. The paper also discusses the role of subscription cost and subsidy in facilitating adoption, which can be analyzed using information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
