The use of zero knowledge proofs and communication complexity also suggests categories such as \"Cryptography and Security\" (cs.CR) and \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT). The mention of hardness amplification and approximate degree suggests a connection to \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS) and \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
