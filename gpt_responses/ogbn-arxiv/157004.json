The paper focuses on using road markings as static and robust features to solve the extrinsic calibration problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), robotics (cs.RO), and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a framework that utilizes multiple cost functions for optimization, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the repeatability of the proposed method, which suggests that it may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
