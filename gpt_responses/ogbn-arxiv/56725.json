Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of pre-trained models into sequence to sequence models, which falls under the category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions gains in BLEU score, which is a common evaluation metric in natural language processing, indicating the category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper achieves a new state of the art on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, which is a common benchmark for text summarization, suggesting the category cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
