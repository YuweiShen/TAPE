This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the trade-off among different rates, which is a common theme in communication engineering (cs.CE) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a decoding strategy for the receiver, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
