The main goal of the project is to port an application onto ndnSIM, which is a network simulator. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - Peer-to-peer file sharing is a distributed computing paradigm, and the paper discusses the use of NDN, which is a distributed data-centric networking architecture. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the data-centric approach used by BitTorrent and NDN, which involves breaking files into pieces and requesting them from peers. This is related to data structures and algorithms used in distributed systems. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography and security, but these topics are relevant to peer-to-peer file sharing and networking in general. \n5. cs.PF (Performance) - The paper discusses the use of ndnSIM for simulation and testing, which is related to performance evaluation of networking protocols and applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
