Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) which is a communication technology, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. The paper also discusses the use of edge computing and distributed storing capabilities, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of power and subchannel allocation, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper discusses simulation results, which could fall under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
