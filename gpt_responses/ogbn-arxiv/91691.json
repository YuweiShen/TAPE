Specifically, the paper proposes a Bayesian inference approach to regularization, which is a common technique in the subfield of Bayesian machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with neural networks, which is a topic that is relevant to several other subfields of machine learning, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
