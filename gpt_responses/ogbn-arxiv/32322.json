The use of multiple antennas and beamforming techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the study of power transfer and energy harvesting in wireless systems may be relevant to the Computer Engineering (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
