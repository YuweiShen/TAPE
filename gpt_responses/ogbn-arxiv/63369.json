The use of Gaussian process models and information-theoretic exploration strategies suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The analysis of time complexity and theoretical guarantees on active sampling performance suggest a systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the empirical evaluation on real-world data suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
