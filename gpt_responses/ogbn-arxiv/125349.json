This topic falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the construction of binary linear codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CR). The codes are used for PIR, which involves accessing a database, a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions puncturing and shortening of codes, which are techniques used in error-correcting codes (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the generalized Hamming weights of codes, which is a topic in signal processing and communications (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
