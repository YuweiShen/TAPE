The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using various combinations of hidden layers and epochs, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a dataset for the evaluation purpose also suggests the possibility of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with image classification, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
