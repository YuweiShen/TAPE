The concept of capacity is also mentioned, which is a common topic in communication theory (cs.CC). The paper also involves analyzing the linear capacity, which is a topic in linear algebra and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a noise and signal alignment approach, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
