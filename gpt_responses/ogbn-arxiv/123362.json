The use of deep learning methods, specifically CNNs, is also mentioned, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves training on multiscale images, which could be related to neural networks with multiple layers (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of similarity measures, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
