It also mentions the use of syntactic features familiar to functional language programmers. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a new web browser engine and outlines several pitfalls encountered along the way. \n- cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper discusses the use of Rust to build a systems programming language and mentions the control of underlying hardware features and memory. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the goal of creating a more memory-safe web browser engine. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This is less likely, but the paper does mention the use of parallel hardware, which could potentially be related to machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
