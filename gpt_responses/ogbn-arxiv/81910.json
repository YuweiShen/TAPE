It also involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also focuses on improving the quality of retrieval, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of a nonlinear transfer function and the proposed loss function indicate that this paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. \n\nThe experiments conducted on data sets such as CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products suggest that this paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on improving the quality of retrieval through modifications to feature vectors suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category, as similar techniques are used in text retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
