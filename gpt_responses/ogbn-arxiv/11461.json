The paper proposes a new loss function to replace the SoftMax loss, which is a common loss function used in classification tasks. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
