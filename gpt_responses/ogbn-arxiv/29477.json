The model proposed in the paper involves training a perceptual front-end and a dynamics predictor, which are both based on neural networks, indicating that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions applications in robotics (cs.RO) and decision-making/planning (cs.AI), further supporting the inclusion of these sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with physical systems, which can be seen as a control problem, suggesting that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
