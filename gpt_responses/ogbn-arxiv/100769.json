It also involves information theory (cs.IT) in terms of characterizing the rate of secure computation. The use of graphs in the paper suggests a connection to algorithms and complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the optimization of rates and protocols involves machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
