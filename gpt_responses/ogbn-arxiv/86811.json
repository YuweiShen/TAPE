The paper proposes a new aggregation model factorBT that accounts for biases in pairwise tasks, which is relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the use of the model for information retrieval (cs.IR) and social and information networks (cs.SI), which are relevant to the application of ranking in real-world data sets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
