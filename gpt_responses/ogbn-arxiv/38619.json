The use of spreading sequences and power distribution also suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the application of the concept of indecomposable errors and the use of upper and lower bounds suggest a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
