The paper also presents new characterizations and parametrizations of LCD codes, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the action of the orthogonal group on the set of all LCD codes, which is related to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents some asymptotic results, which are related to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
