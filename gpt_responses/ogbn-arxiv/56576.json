This approach allows the agent to learn robust policies using only a small number of expert demonstrations and self-supervised interactions with the environment. The paper also compares the proposed approach to a state-of-the-art imitation learning method and demonstrates its superior performance on simulated robot manipulation tasks and real robot experiments. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
