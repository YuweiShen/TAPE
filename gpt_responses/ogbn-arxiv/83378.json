This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also proposes new communication schemes, which involve designing algorithms and protocols, falling under the signal processing (cs.SI) and computer engineering (cs.CE) categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of these schemes using simulations, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
