The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves boosting, which is a machine learning technique, and thus falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of Region Proposal Networks (RPNs), which is a technique used in robotics and autonomous systems (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of previous methods, which could be considered under cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it involves identifying and addressing weaknesses in existing systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
