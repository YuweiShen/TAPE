This falls under the domain of robotics.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The tracking system is based on web-cams and involves pose estimation of the quadcopter. This involves computer vision techniques such as feature detection and matching, and hence falls under this category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of an \"Internet of Things\" mini-board to control the quadcopter and make it autonomous. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the use of markers on the quadcopter for tracking. This involves computer graphics techniques such as marker design and placement.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the use of web-cams for tracking and the construction of a low-cost tracking system. This falls under the domain of multimedia systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
