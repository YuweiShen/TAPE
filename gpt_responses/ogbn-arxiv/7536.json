The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained classification layers, which is a specific aspect of transfer learning that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of normalization and scaling, which are common techniques in neural network optimization and could be relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
