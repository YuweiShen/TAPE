The paper also discusses the issue of approximation errors and their propagation in the value function, which is relevant to optimization and control systems (cs.SY). The paper does not focus on a specific application area, so it is less likely to belong to sub-categories such as computer vision or natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
