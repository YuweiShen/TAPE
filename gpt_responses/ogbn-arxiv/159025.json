The paper also talks about breaking up the traditional READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP and retrofitting it into a model of parallel and asynchronous proof processing, which involves concepts of programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The Isabelle/Scala approach to prover interaction and integration mentioned in the paper also involves concepts of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
