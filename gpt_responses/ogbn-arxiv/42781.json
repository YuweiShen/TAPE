The use of partial orders and event structures also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.THEORY). Finally, the paper's discussion of visual frameworks and applications suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
