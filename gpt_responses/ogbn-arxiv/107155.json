The proposed framework for automated annotation of software code with respect to human values involves the use of machine learning algorithms, which falls under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY). The paper also discusses the potential biases that can be introduced in software, which is a topic of interest in computer science (cs.CS). The proposed framework aims to improve the user experience of software, which is a key concern in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper proposes a framework for making recommendations to overcome biases and value breaches in software, which involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
