This problem is a fundamental topic in information theory and communication engineering, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking). The paper also presents closed-form asymptotic expressions for SEP and BEP for arbitrary constellations and input distributions, which involves mathematical analysis and probability theory, making it relevant to cs.SI (Statistics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the maximum likelihood (ML) detector and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector, which involves machine learning and optimization, making it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
