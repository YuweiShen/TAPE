This involves program induction, which is a subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The proposed method is applied to system identification of dynamical systems (cs.SY) and explaining the behavior of a DQN agent (cs.SE). The paper also introduces the $\\pi$-machine, which is an architecture for inducing interpretable LISP-like programs (cs.PL). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.SY, cs.SE, and cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
