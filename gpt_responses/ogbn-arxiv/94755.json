This involves optimizing power allocations and canceling interference at the UAV. These are typical topics in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with communication between UAVs and base stations in a cellular network. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes algorithms for optimizing power allocations and interference cancellation. These are typical topics in systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with improving the quality of communication for UAVs in a cellular network. This can be considered a multimedia application.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes algorithms for optimizing power allocations and interference cancellation.
