The paper also involves the study of rate regions, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.IT). The paper's focus on secure multi-party computation suggests a possible categorization under cs.DS (distributed, parallel, and cluster computing). The paper's use of monotonicity properties and efficiency of protocols suggests a possible categorization under cs.SI (social and information networks). Finally, the paper's use of common information and its generalization suggests a possible categorization under cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
