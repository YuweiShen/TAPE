The paper also discusses the tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth, which is a fundamental problem in distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper's focus on exact repair and the development of novel information theoretic converse proofs suggest that it may also belong to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
