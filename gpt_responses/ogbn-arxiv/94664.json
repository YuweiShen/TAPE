This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n\n2. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of hardware aliasing, which is a hardware-level issue. Therefore, it is likely to be classified under the hardware architecture sub-category.\n\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper also extends the technique to cover the emerging technology of encrypted computing. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses a technique for ensuring safe compilation of code in the presence of hardware aliasing. This falls under the domain of software engineering.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a problem encountered by systems programmers and proposes a technique for addressing it.
