These tasks are commonly associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research. The proposed approach uses a CNN-based pixel-wise predictor, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.DL). The paper also discusses task-specific post-processing blocks, which could be related to natural language processing (cs.CL) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
