Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the hardware implementation and optimization, which could fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses power efficiency and I/O efficiency, which could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
