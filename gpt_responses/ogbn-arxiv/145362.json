The paper proposes a new approach to separate the planning and realization steps in neural data-to-text generation. This approach involves a symbolic text-planning stage and a neural generation stage. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, which are covered by several other sub-categories. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nThe paper's approach involves training a plan-to-text generator, which involves matching reference texts to their corresponding text plans. This task is related to information retrieval and text summarization, which are covered by cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL. \n\nFinally, the paper's approach involves selecting high-quality text plans for new inputs, which is a task related to reinforcement learning and decision-making. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
