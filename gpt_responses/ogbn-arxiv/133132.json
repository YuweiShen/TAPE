The paper also discusses the impact of delay on these tradeoffs, which is related to system dynamics and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of soft decoding, which is a technique commonly used in networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper focuses on MIMO channels, which is a topic in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
