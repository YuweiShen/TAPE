Additionally, the use of decision lists is a common technique in computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category because it discusses the use of a corpus acquired from the Web. \n\nThe use of machine learning techniques such as decision lists suggests that this paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on supervised learning and the use of hand-tagged corpora suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the use of fine-grained senses in WordNet suggests that this paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category, which often deals with natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
