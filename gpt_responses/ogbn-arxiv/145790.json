This problem is closely related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also uses optimization techniques (cs.LG) and establishes connections with certain classes of frames (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves numerical computations and simulations (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
