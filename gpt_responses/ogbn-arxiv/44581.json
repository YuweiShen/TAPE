It also involves data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AL) for maintaining and updating the drawing as new edges are added to the graph. The use of polynomial area for certain types of streamed graph drawings suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of file maintenance algorithms suggests a possible connection to database systems (cs.DB), although this is less likely than the other categories mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
