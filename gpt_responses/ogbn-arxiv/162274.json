The proposed methods also exploit the sparsity of the channel, which is a common theme in signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents a low-complexity detection method based on belief propagation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
