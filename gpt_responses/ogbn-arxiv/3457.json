The paper focuses on the high-dimensional setting and provides information-theoretic lower bounds on the measurement rate needed to attain a desired fraction of errors in the sparsity pattern estimate. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the tightness of the bounds in a scaling sense, which may also relate to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Mathematical Modeling (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
