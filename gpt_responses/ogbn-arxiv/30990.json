It also involves the use of deep neural networks (cs.LG) to learn discriminative representations of shapes. The paper proposes a novel approach to address the problem of low discriminative ability of projections, which involves the use of score vectors to weight image features. This approach involves the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) to evaluate the quality of views and adjust their contributions to the representation of shapes. The paper also involves the use of graphics (cs.GR) to generate 3D shapes and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Finally, the paper involves the use of multimedia (cs.MM) to present the experimental results in the form of images and tables."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
