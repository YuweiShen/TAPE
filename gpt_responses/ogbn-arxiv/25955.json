The paper also proposes VLSI designs for the precoding algorithms, which falls under the category of computer architecture and embedded systems (cs.AR). The paper also deals with system-level design and optimization, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and engineering and technology (cs.ET). Finally, the paper discusses FPGA implementations, which is related to networked and distributed systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
