The paper proposes a new deep learning model that combines global and local features for image retrieval, which involves feature extraction and matching (cs.IR). The paper also leverages recent feature learning work and proposes a model that combines generalized mean pooling and attentive selection, which are techniques in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper evaluates the proposed model on image datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency and performance of the proposed model, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
