The proposed technique is specifically designed for color images (cs.MM and cs.CV), and involves manipulating the least significant bits of the image pixels (cs.IT). The evaluation of the technique involves analyzing the change in image histograms and signal-to-noise ratio (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
