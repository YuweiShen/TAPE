The paper also discusses encoding methods such as bag-of-words, VLAD, and Fisher vector, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper introduces a new aggregation strategy for local descriptors, which involves encoding the angle in a continuous manner, which could be considered a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses an efficient monomial embedding, which is a mathematical concept that could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
