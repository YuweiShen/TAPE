The paper also introduces a new type of code, called robust batch codes, which involves multiple queries to the codeword and can be seen as a generalization of the MDS property. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of its results, which could place it in the cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
