The ultraproduct construction is a common tool in graph theory and is often used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses limit objects, which is a topic in topology and analysis, and is relevant to the sub-categories of cs.DS (data structures) and cs.LO (logic in computer science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
