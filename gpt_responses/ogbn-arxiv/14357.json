The paper focuses on the reconfigurable nature of the system and its ability to find collision-free paths in constrained and obstacle-laden environments. This work involves robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) as it deals with the design and motion planning of a robotic system. The probabilistic strategy used in the approach involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the evaluation studies involve computer vision (cs.CV) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
