The paper also discusses feedback interconnection in the dynamics of the systems, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of free inputs to accomplish high-level tasks suggests a connection to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses motion planning capabilities, which is a topic studied in the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper proposes a decentralized framework, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
