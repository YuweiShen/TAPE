The paper also proposes new algorithms that achieve tight approximation guarantees with minimum memory and low adaptive complexity, which are topics of interest in machine learning (cs.LG), data mining (cs.DM), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the algorithms on real-world data summarization tasks, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
