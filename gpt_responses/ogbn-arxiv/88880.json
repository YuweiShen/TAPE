Therefore, computer vision (cs.CV) is the most likely sub-category. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also a possibility since the system is designed to extract information from scanned documents. Machine learning (cs.LG) is another possible sub-category since the system uses a trained model to recognize marked and non-marked squares. Data structures (cs.DS) could also be relevant since the system performs a structural analysis of the document. Finally, natural language processing (cs.CL) could be a potential sub-category since the system may need to process text in the test questions and answers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
