The paper proposes a neural modular approach to building such systems, which involves combining multiple expert bots to generate responses for different dialogue contexts. This approach involves training the expert bots to specialize in different domains and types of actions, which requires machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a Token-level Mixture-of-Expert (TokenMoE) model to implement the proposed framework, which involves combining the outputs of multiple expert bots to generate the final response. This approach involves using techniques such as mixture models (cs.NE) and ensemble learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
