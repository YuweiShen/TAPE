It is also likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the problem of instance segmentation on 3D point clouds is important for the realization of autonomous cars and robots. The paper also proposes a new method using embeddings, which involves machine learning techniques and could be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes new metrics for evaluating instance segmentation performance, which could be categorized under Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as metrics are often used in natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
