The proposed method involves learning a selection strategy using latent-SVM, which is a machine learning technique (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of context in object detection, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The method involves selecting informative context, which is a natural language processing concept (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method using mean average precision, which is a common evaluation metric in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
