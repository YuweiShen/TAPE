The paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines expert knowledge with random exploration to add diversity to the sampling of DAM systems. This algorithm is based on bandit algorithms, which are commonly used in recommendation systems for improving diversity. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DB (Databases), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
