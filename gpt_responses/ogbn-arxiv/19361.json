The paper proposes a combined model of low-level saliency and object center-bias, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper analyzes fixation data for scene free-viewing, which suggests that it could also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also proposes a model that outperforms individual components, which suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with understanding strategies that humans use in observing scenes and objects, which suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
