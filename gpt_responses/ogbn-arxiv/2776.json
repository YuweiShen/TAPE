This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and multiple antenna systems (cs.MM). The paper also discusses low-complexity algorithms for signal detection and channel estimation, which could be relevant to the fields of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results comparing the performance of GSM-MIMO to other MIMO systems, which could be of interest to the computer communications (cs.COM) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
