The paper also discusses the application of the energy detection technique in cognitive radio networks, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and system and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents numerical results that are validated by Monte Carlo simulations, which is a common practice in the field of computer networks and communications (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
