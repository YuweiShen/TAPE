This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves training a single slimmable network to approximate the accuracy of different channel configurations, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experiments with different network architectures, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
