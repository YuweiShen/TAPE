The authors also introduce a distributed approach for customizing LSTM models for every detector in large-scale transportation networks, which involves optimization and decision-making processes (cs.NE, cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes experiments with image data to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
