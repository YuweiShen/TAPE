This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG: The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques for extracting norms from privacy case law. This is a subfield of machine learning.\n- cs.CR: The paper deals with privacy case law, which is a topic related to computer security and privacy. This falls under the scope of computer security and cryptography.\n- cs.CL: The paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques for extracting information from court decisions. This is a subfield of computational linguistics.\n- cs.LO: The paper proposes a definition of deducibility based on legal concepts and provides an equivalent characterization in terms of logic satisfiability. This falls under the scope of logic and verification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
