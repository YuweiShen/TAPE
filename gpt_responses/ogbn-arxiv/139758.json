The paper also introduces a new hierarchy over set functions, which involves concepts of monotonicity and submodularity, and can be seen as a contribution to the field of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper presents applications of the hierarchy to approximation algorithms and price of anarchy, which are relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
