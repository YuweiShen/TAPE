It deals with network congestion and proposes a network feedback module to monitor the network congestion. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with delay-sensitive multimedia communication between remote locations with distinct Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for different media components. \n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper reports qualitative results of a real-time telepottery experiment with several human subjects, which reveal that DPM preserves the quality of telehaptic activity even under heavily congested network scenarios. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - Telehaptic communication is an important aspect of teleoperation in robotics. The proposed protocol can be used for telehaptic communication in robotics applications. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a congestion control protocol for telehaptic communication, which can be seen as a control problem in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
