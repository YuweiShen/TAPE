Additionally, the use of deep learning frameworks further supports this categorization. The paper also involves the use of adaptive attention learning, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of benchmarks for evaluation suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the focus on facial expressions and emotions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
