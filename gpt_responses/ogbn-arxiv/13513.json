The paper also incorporates machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI) to predict metrics useful for computation offloading. Finally, the paper explores the viability of using Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) to make intelligent predictions, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
