Therefore, cs.ET (EDA and VLSI Technology), cs.AR (Computer Architecture), and cs.DC (Digital Circuits) are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a CMOS process, which is related to semiconductor technology, making cs.DS (Digital Systems) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses low power/energy design, which is a common concern in embedded systems, making cs.EM (Embedded Systems) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
