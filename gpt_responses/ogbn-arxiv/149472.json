The proposed solution involves using Transformers-based Language Models, which are a type of neural network commonly used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and related tasks. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the proposed solution involves using neural networks, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions text summarization, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as it involves processing and analyzing textual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
