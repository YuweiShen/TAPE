The paper also proposes novel probability theory-based derivations for calculating attack probability, which is a common technique used in cryptography and security research.\n\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with attacks on blockchain networks, which are distributed systems. The paper also discusses the proportion of computing power required for successful attacks, which is a common topic in distributed computing research.\n\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with attacks on blockchain networks, which are based on peer-to-peer networking. The paper also discusses the proportion of computing power required for successful attacks, which is a common topic in networking and internet architecture research.\n\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper discusses the profitability of double-spending attacks, which can be viewed as a game between the attacker and the network. The paper also proposes conditions for profitable attacks, which can be viewed as a solution concept in game theory.\n\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the profitability of double-spending attacks, which can be viewed as a financial problem.
