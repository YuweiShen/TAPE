The use of multiple traces to aid in decoding suggests that the paper may also be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper proposes a coding scheme, which may be of interest to the cryptography and security community (cs.CR). Finally, the paper's focus on DNA-based storage suggests that it may also be relevant to the bioinformatics and computational biology community (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
