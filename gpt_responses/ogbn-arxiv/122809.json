The paper proposes a novel approach to detecting adversarial attacks by exploiting the fact that adversarial perturbations are harder to find with gradient methods or have substantially higher density than for natural images. This problem falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the problem of security and privacy (cs.CR) in machine learning systems. The approach proposed in the paper involves developing a practical test for detecting adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the manipulation of images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
