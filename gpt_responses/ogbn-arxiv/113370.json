Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the design of a proof system that respects the modularity and locality of assumptions, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of disjunctions to construct efficiently executable specifications is a topic related to programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the extension and strengthening of proof-theoretic justifications, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
