Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses network security principles, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The proposed framework, IDIoT, involves enforcing security policies on IoT devices, which could also fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper mentions the use of AI for IoT security, which could place it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
