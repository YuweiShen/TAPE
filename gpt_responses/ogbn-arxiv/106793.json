It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as camera localization is a common problem in robotics. The use of global approximate k-nearest neighbor search suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of feature co-visibility captured by clustering the 3D model camera pose graph suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of diagnostic analyses on a difficult test dataset containing globally repetitive structure suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
