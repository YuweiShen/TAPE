This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed method also involves deep convolutional neural network techniques, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
