Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The method involves normalization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The paper also involves training a model to perform well on unseen datasets, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of security and commercial applications, which may fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
