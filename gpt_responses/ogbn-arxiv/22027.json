This topic falls under the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT), communication (cs.COMM), networked systems (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper discusses coding schemes and information theoretic viewpoints, which are typical of cs.IT and cs.COMM. The use of diversity embedded codes for fading channels is relevant to cs.NI and cs.SI. Finally, the paper also mentions a deterministic structural observation, which is related to cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
