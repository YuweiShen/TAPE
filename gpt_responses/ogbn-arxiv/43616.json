The use of an automatic compiler to generate FPGA-synthesizable RTL also suggests a focus on computer-aided design (cs.AR) and hardware architecture (cs.AR, cs.ET). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of optimized RTL libraries and a cyclic weight storage/access scheme, which are related to digital circuits and systems (cs.DC) and embedded systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
