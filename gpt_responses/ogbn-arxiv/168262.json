This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of mutual information lower bound, which is a common technique in statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of a small number of pilot symbols, which is related to network optimization (cs.NI) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
