This falls under the category of social networks and computational social science (cs.SOC). The paper also uses a model with boundedly rational agents, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of exogenous parameters on the evolution of networks, which could be related to cybersecurity (cs.CYBER). Finally, the paper uses stochastic processes to model the meeting and decision-making process, which could be related to statistical learning (cs.LG). However, since the focus is more on social networks and decision-making, we consider cs.SI to be the most likely category, followed by cs.SOC, cs.AI, cs.MA, and cs.CYBER."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
