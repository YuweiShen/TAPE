The paper also discusses ZCA whitening and PCA denoising, which are normalization strategies for deep networks, and thus could fall under the sub-categories of numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper introduces a new normalization strategy for deep networks, which could also fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
