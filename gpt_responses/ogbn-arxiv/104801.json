Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security).

Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of dynamic analysis, which could place it in cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
