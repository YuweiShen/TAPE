This makes it highly likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of SVM and Random Kitchen Sink approach, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of unlabelled data, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
