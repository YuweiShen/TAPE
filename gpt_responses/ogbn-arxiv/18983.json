The use of distributed algorithms and the focus on minimizing the number of robots needed suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper's use of self-stabilizing map construction may also place it in the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
