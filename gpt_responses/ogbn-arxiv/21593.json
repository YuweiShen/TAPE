This involves modeling groups of remote clients accessing video content replicated to spatially distributed edge servers, which suggests a focus on network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also proposes an optimization problem to maximize QoE of individual clients, proportional fairness in allocating limited resources of base stations, and balancing utilized resources among multiple servers, which suggests a focus on mathematical optimization (cs.MM) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper discusses simulations to explore parameter space and compare performance to purely client-based DASH, which suggests a focus on simulation and modeling (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
