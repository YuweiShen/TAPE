The paper also mentions that the language allows the programmer to specify which parts of the application can be updated, which suggests it could belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the formalization of the language's semantics, which suggests it could belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also mentions the generation of code for each site, which suggests it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the safety of runtime updates, which suggests it could belong to cs.Distributed (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
