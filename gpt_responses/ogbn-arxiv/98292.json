The paper also discusses the use of HashTag codes, which are a recent development in coding theory (cs.DC). The paper's focus on optimization metrics such as repair bandwidth, I/O operations, and access time suggests that it may also be relevant to systems and networking (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
