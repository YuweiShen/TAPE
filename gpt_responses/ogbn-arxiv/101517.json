The paper presents optimal algorithms for this problem in both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ settings, with sample complexity that is information-theoretically optimal. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.IT (information theory), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.CC (computational complexity), and cs.SI (social and information networks). Among these, cs.DS and cs.IT seem to be the most likely categories, as the paper deals with algorithmic and information-theoretic aspects of the problem, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
