Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also focuses on the scalability of the existing secure DNN, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a computation graph split between parties and a neutral server, which can be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also deals with real-world applications such as fraud detection and financial distress prediction, which can be categorized under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
