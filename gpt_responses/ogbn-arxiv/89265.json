The paper also mentions the use of a kinematic hand model and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the design numerically and experimentally, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The optimization algorithm used in the paper is also related to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the stability of the target grasps, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
