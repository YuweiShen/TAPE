The method proposed in the paper uses the Manhattan world assumption, which is a common approach in graphics and robotics (cs.GR, cs.RO). The paper also proposes novel constraints based on physical realizability of the 3D scene structure, which involves reasoning about the geometry of the scene, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method uses mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to solve the reconstruction problem, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
