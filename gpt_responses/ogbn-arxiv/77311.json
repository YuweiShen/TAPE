This involves generating partitions for multiple persons from their global joint candidates and inferring instance-specific joint configurations simultaneously. This approach involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques such as joint detection and re-organization, as well as machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG) techniques such as generative models and optimization. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmarks for human pose estimation (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
