The paper focuses on natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enable models to combine disjoint pieces of textual evidence. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves evaluating models and proposing strategies to improve their performance, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques to select relevant information, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
