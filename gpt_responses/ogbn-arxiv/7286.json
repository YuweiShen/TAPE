Additionally, the paper presents applications of 2D Lyndon words in constructing de Bruijn sequences and finding the lexicographically smallest or largest substring in a string, which are also topics in discrete mathematics.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper presents an algorithm for capturing 2D horizontal periodicity of a matrix, which can be seen as a geometric problem. Additionally, the paper presents an algorithm for solving 2D horizontal suffix-prefix matching among a set of patterns, which can also be seen as a computational geometry problem.\n4. cs.DL (Digital Libraries) - The paper presents an algorithm for 2D dictionary matching, which is a topic in digital libraries.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper presents an algorithm that achieves linear time complexity even when the least common multiple of the periods of the rows is exponential in the matrix width, which is a topic in computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
