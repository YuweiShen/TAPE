The method is based on a dictionary-based framework and involves two cascaded stages. The first stage resembles a sparse reconstruction problem, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The second stage computes the final microstructure, which involves neural network computation and optimization, making it relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the proposed method is applied to brain dMRI scans, which is a common application in medical imaging (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
