The proposed method involves adapting a subspace codebook based on angle-of-departure (AoD) information, which is a technique used in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of massive MIMO systems, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of the proposed method with an analog feedback method, which is a topic related to computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
