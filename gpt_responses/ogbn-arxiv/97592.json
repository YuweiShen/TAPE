Additionally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks, which is a common topic in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of regularization, which is a common topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The strategy for successively growing the depth of the model suggests that it may also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
