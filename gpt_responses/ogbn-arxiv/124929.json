This involves using attention models to connect information from both the user instructions and a topological representation of the environment. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques for language-related tasks. The paper's focus on translating natural language instructions to a high-level plan for robot navigation makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category deals with research on robots and their applications. The paper's focus on behavioral robot navigation makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with research on artificial intelligence and its applications. The paper's use of deep learning models for translating natural language instructions to a high-level plan for robot navigation makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with research on machine learning and its applications.
