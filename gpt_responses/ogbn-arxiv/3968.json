The paper also discusses the evaluation of object proposals, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The authors perform exhaustive evaluations and cross-dataset generalization experiments, which are common in machine learning and statistical analysis (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the bias capacity in object proposal algorithms, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the authors introduce a diagnostic experiment to detect bias, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
