This suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of computer security (cs.CR), operating systems (cs.OS), software engineering (cs.SE), systems and control (cs.SY), or architecture (cs.AR). However, given the focus on security and the use of TrustZone technology, cs.CR and cs.OS are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
