Machine learning techniques are often used for time series forecasting and the proposed methods involve optimization techniques commonly used in machine learning.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The problem of sequential tensor completion involves the recovery of missing entries from a tensor, which can be seen as a problem of information recovery. The paper proposes methods based on Discrete Fourier Transform and Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization, which are related to signal processing and information theory.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed methods are tested on images and videos, which are common applications of computer vision and pattern recognition. The problem of sequential tensor completion can also be seen as a problem of video inpainting, which is a topic of interest in computer vision.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The problem of sequential tensor completion involves the manipulation of tensors, which are multidimensional arrays. This is a topic of interest in data structures and algorithms, and the proposed methods involve optimization techniques commonly used in this field.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The problem of sequential tensor completion can be seen as a problem of network inference, where the missing entries in the tensor correspond to missing links in a network.
