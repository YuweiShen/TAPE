The proposed method involves the use of deep learning techniques for feature extraction and fusion, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses a novel technique for learning a probability distribution over future trajectories, which is related to probabilistic modeling (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
