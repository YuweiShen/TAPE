It may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category as it describes the detailed design of a network domain supporting VNF chaining through the SRv6 network programming model. Additionally, it may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category as it discusses the implementation of the proposed solution for a Linux based NFV host. It may also belong to the Architecture (cs.AR) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories as it describes the concepts of SR-aware and SR-unaware Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and proposes a solution for SR-unaware VNFs hosted in a NFV node."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
