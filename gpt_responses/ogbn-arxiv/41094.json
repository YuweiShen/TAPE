The paper proposes a novel neural network framework for this task, which involves adaptive zooming and learning part locations, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on a popular dataset used in computer vision and robotics research, KITTI, which is often used in the computer vision and pattern recognition conference (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
