The paper also proposes a novel hierarchical multi-patch network, which involves training and optimizing a deep neural network, making it relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the runtime performance of the proposed model, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
