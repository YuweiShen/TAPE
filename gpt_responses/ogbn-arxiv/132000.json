Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these fields often use graph neural networks. The paper also discusses the robustness of these models, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the use of meta-gradients suggests a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
