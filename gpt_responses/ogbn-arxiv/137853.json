Additionally, the paper uses deep neural networks, which are a popular tool in machine learning. The paper also deals with image classification (cs.CV), as it uses datasets of images to test the robustness of the classifiers. The paper also deals with adversarial attacks (cs.CR), which are a common problem in machine learning security. The paper also deals with the geometry of high dimensional classification problems, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
