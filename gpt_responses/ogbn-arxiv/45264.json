Additionally, the package is integrated with Python scientific packages, which could also place it under the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. The paper also mentions tools for developing scientific applications, which could fall under the Modeling and Simulation (cs.MS) sub-category. The package may also be relevant to the Deep Learning (cs.DL) sub-category, as 3D visualization is often used in deep learning applications. Finally, the package may be relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category, as it involves the visualization of scientific data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
