Specifically, the paper uses attribution methods to analyze the decision-making process of machine learning models and detect adversarial examples. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, since the paper uses image data and perturbations, it is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
