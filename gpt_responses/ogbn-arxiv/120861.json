The paper proposes a method of analytic moment propagation for normalization, which is a technique used in various subfields of computer science such as machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
