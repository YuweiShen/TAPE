The use of shared randomness is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication complexity (cs.CC), as well as data structures (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper introduces a new measure called collision complexity, which is a concept that is relevant to the study of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
