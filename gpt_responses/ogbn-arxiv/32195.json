The paper specifically discusses the use of Lasso and Group-Lasso estimators, which are commonly used in machine learning and signal processing. Additionally, the application to wireless sensor networks falls under the systems and control sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.LG, and cs.SP, followed by cs.SI and cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
