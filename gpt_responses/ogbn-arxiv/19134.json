The paper also discusses the incorporation of additional weights in signal-flow graphs, which is a common topic in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The use of heuristics and algorithmic techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions the performance of neural networks on tasks, which is a common topic in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the initialization of network parameters, which is a topic in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
