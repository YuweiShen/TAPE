The paper proposes a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure, which is a type of neural network commonly used in machine learning (LG). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SD (Sound), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
