The paper also discusses the use of compressed sensing in different bases, which falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). The application of the result to the redundant dictionary setting in compressed sensing suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
