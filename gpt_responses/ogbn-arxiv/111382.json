The paper also introduces a novel framework called optimization from samples (OPS), which is likely to fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the statistical learnability and optimizability of different classes of functions, which could fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses approximation algorithms for optimization under different constraints, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
