This falls under the domain of AI. \n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the implementation of a plan graph, which is a data structure used in planning. This falls under the domain of programming languages. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper mentions that STAN competed in a planning competition and compared well with other competitors in terms of speed. Machine learning techniques could have been used to optimize the performance of STAN. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the implementation of a data structure (plan graph) and provides experimental results to demonstrate its efficiency. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper describes the implementation of STAN's plan graph and how it was optimized for performance. This falls under the domain of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
