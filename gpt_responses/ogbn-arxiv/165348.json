This falls under the broad category of supervised learning, which is covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. Specifically, the paper focuses on post-estimation smoothing as a separate step from the original predictor, which can be applied to a broad class of machine learning tasks without the need to retrain models. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
