This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the design of a receiver for a point-to-point system that operates in the vicinity of active interfering nodes, which could fall under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of hybrid analog/digital beamforming for simultaneous ID and EH, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of eigen-modes, which could be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of the proposed receiver structure to the classical receiver structure, which could be relevant to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
