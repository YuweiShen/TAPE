This is a software engineering approach to address spreadsheet risks.\n- cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the Sarbanes-Oxley act, which is a US law that requires public companies to maintain adequate internal controls to ensure financial reporting accuracy and prevent fraud. The paper's method aims to reduce spreadsheet risk, which can be a security concern in the context of financial reporting.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Similar to cs.CY, the paper's focus on managing spreadsheet risks can be seen as a security concern, as errors or fraud in spreadsheets can have financial or legal consequences.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions tool-assisted evaluation, which can involve programming languages and techniques for analyzing code. The paper's method may involve programming languages or tools for analyzing spreadsheets.\n- cs.DB (Databases): Spreadsheets can be seen as a type of database, and the paper's method involves managing risks related to spreadsheet use. The paper may discuss issues related to data integrity, consistency, or management in spreadsheets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
