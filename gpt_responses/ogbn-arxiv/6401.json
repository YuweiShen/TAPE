This topic is closely related to the field of networked communication systems, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of spatial multiplexing for increasing the data rate of VLC, which is a topic related to information theory and falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the reuse of physical and data link layers of RF WiFi for VLC, which is a topic related to communication systems and falls under the category of cs.COMM (Communications and Networking). The paper also presents experimental results on the performance of the proposed system, which is related to multimedia systems and falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the use of multiple antennas for improving the robustness of VLC links in the presence of obstacles and node mobility, which is a topic related to robotics and falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
