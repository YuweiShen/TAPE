It also discusses the issue of redundancy in high-cardinality categorical variables, which is a problem often encountered in databases (cs.DB). The paper proposes a new encoding method based on similarities across categories, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on real-world datasets, which is a common practice in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
