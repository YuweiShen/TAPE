It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories as it formulates the score as a function of standard detector results and contextual relations, which is an optimization problem. The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) in understanding contextual relations. Finally, the paper analyzes the ability of context to handle different types of false detections, which may fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
