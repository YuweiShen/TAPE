The paper focuses on the use of modular robots, which are commonly used in robotics research and development, and the use of perception-driven augmentation tools to extend the adaptive capabilities of modular robot systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of high-level planning and environment characterization algorithms, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the locomotion capabilities of the robot, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves the use of specially-designed building blocks, which is related to materials science (cs.MA). Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.SY, and cs.MA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
