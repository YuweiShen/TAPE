The use of non-convex methods for learning quadratic models suggests that the paper may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The sample complexity and error guarantee analysis may also suggest the paper could belong to the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the experiments on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
