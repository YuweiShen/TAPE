It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it uses a sequential model-based optimization strategy to search for structures in order of increasing complexity while simultaneously learning a surrogate model to guide the search through structure space. Additionally, it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a more efficient method for learning CNN structures. It may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it compares its method to recent state-of-the-art methods based on reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. Finally, it may belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it uses a sequential model-based optimization strategy, which is a common technique in natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
