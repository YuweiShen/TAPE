This involves optimizing offloading decision, transmission power, and resource allocation. The paper also introduces a related and regularized stacked auto encoder (2r-SAE) for data compression and representation, an adaptive simulated annealing based approach (ASA) for action search, and a preserved and prioritized experience replay (2p-ER) to assist the DRL training. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) to some extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
