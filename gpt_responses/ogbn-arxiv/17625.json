The use of run length encoding (RLE) is a common technique in string algorithms, and the paper proposes efficient algorithms for computing Abelian regularities using RLE. This suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), information theory (cs.IT), or computational geometry (cs.CG), which are all relevant to string algorithms and data structures. Among these categories, cs.DS and cs.CC are the most likely, as they are the most directly related to the problem of computing regularities in strings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
