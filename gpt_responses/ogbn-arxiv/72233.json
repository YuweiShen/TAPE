This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Robotics sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel walking stabilization method that combines two existing approaches to improve tracking performance. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, but the proposed walking stabilization method involves optimization using quadratic programming. This could be considered a form of machine learning, and hence the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper does not involve any computer vision techniques, but the HRP-4 humanoid robot is equipped with cameras and sensors for perception and navigation. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a walking stabilization method that involves both end-effector and CoM strategies, and uses whole-body admittance control. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
