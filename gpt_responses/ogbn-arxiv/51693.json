The specific application is in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), which involves complex physical simulations, suggesting a potential fit for categories related to physics and engineering (cs.CE). The paper also emphasizes the importance of physical consistency in the surrogate models, which could be relevant to categories related to artificial intelligence and robotics (cs.AI, cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency and accuracy of the surrogate models, which could be relevant to categories related to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
