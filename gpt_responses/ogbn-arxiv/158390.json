The problem is also related to distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC), as the robots are asynchronous and operate without direct communication. The use of sensors and limited visibility also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the exploration problem can be seen as a control problem, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
