The use of DCNNs for feature extraction and mapping also falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses super-resolution techniques, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method is based on recognition accuracy, which is a common metric in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
