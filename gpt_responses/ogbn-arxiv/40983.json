It may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category as it discusses network conditions and latency control. Information Theory (cs.IT) is another possible category as it involves bitrate adaptation and prediction. Software Engineering (cs.SD) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) are less likely categories, but they could be relevant as the proposed scheme involves frame dropping and video quality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
