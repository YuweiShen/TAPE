The paper proposes a new algorithm for attribute learning using decision trees, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of Zero-Shot learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper specifically focuses on network intrusion detection, which is a subfield of network and internet security (cs.NI).
