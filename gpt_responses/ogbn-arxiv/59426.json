The use of reinforcement learning and neural networks for training the policies suggests that it could also belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of lidar observations, which suggests that it could be related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the policies to sensor, actuator, and localization noise, which suggests that it could be related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
