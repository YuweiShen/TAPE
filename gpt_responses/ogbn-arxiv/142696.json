This involves spatio-temporal registration, motion prediction, simulation, and interpolation. The method is based on a probabilistic latent space and a novel temporal dropout training scheme. The model is applied within a temporal convolutional network and leads to a diffeomorphic motion model encoded as a low-dimensional motion matrix. The paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category due to the focus on image sequences and registration. It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories due to the use of a probabilistic latent space and novel training scheme. The Multimedia (cs.MM) category is also a possibility due to the application to medical image sequences. Finally, the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category may be relevant due to the use of a neural network for the generative deformation model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
