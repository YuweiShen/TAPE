FFSNs are commonly used for illegal online services, making this paper relevant to the computer security (cs.CR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The proposed algorithm also involves mathematical and data mining approaches, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories.
