It also involves communication networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) techniques. The use of constellations and scaling behavior suggests that it could also be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the performance of decoders, which could fall under computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
