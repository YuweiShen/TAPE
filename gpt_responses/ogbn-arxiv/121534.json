The paper specifically addresses the challenge of meta-learning with non-mutually-exclusive tasks, which is a problem that arises in various domains such as computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a new meta-regularization objective that can be applied to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, which suggests that it could be relevant to multiple sub-categories within machine learning such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
