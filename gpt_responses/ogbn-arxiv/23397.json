Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the hardware metrics such as memory footprint, power, and energy consumption, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also investigates training-time methodologies, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
