The paper also proposes a new problem of conditional image-to-image translation, which involves controlling the translated results in the target domain based on a given image in the target domain. This problem is related to conditional GANs and image synthesis, which are also studied in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) community. Additionally, the paper presents experiments on men's faces from-to women's faces translation and edges to shoes&bags translations, which are tasks related to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
