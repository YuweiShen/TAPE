The paper also discusses the use of distributed neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed approach involves integrating localization, segmentation, and recognition steps, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep neural networks also falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on a large dataset, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
