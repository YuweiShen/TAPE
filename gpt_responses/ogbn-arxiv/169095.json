The paper also mentions the usefulness of fused angles in representing orientations, which could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the properties of fused angles, such as their level of mutual independence and axisymmetry, which could be relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
