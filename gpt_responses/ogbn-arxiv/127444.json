Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their capacity limits, which is relevant to this work. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed framework is designed for wireless transmissions, which is a key area of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper investigates the downlink beamforming design of the proposed framework in MISO settings, which is related to the study of control systems. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed framework aims to enhance the SE and EE of wireless transmissions, which is relevant to the study of multimedia systems. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed framework may have implications for security and cryptography in wireless transmissions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
