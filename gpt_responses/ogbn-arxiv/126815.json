This involves designing a decoder with typical structure and sharing a part of weights in the decoder to reduce the number of required parameters. The paper also introduces ensemble learning to work with the proposed approach for improving performance. Given these details, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
