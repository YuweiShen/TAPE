This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper proposes new algorithms to solve it. \n2. cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper formulates the optimization problems as strategic noncooperative games, with the aim of achieving a Nash equilibrium. The paper proposes new distributed iterative algorithms to solve the games, which is a typical application of game theory in computer science. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of resource allocation in a network, where multiple links share the same physical resources. This is a classic problem in networking, and the paper proposes new algorithms to solve it. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes new algorithms to solve the optimization problems, which can be seen as control problems. The algorithms aim to achieve a Nash equilibrium, which is a typical concept in control theory. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of optimizing the transmission rate on each link, using finite order constellations. This is a classic problem in multimedia communication, and the paper proposes new algorithms to solve it."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
