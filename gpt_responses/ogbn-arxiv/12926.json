The use of dual encoder models and approximate nearest neighbor search is a common technique in deep learning-based IR, which falls under the cs.IR sub-category. The paper also involves text processing and language modeling, which are relevant to the cs.CL sub-category. The use of unsupervised negative mining algorithm and the focus on dense representations suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.LG sub-category. The use of anchor-text links in Wikipedia and the focus on entity retrieval suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.AI sub-category. Finally, the paper involves data management and retrieval, which are relevant to the cs.DB sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
