The use of Kronecker-factored curvature estimation technique (KFAC) and gradient estimation method for control variate optimization (RELAX) suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of Atari games as a benchmark for the proposed method suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
