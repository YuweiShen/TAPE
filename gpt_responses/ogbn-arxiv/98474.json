The experiments involve policy search and hyperparameter optimization, which are also common machine learning tasks. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for modeling the relationship between partial and delayed feedback, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The experiments involve optimizing policies and hyperparameters, which are also common AI tasks. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes efficient algorithms for the best arm identification problem with delayed feedback, which is a problem in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel extension of the algorithms to the parallel MAB setting, which is a problem in systems and control. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The experiments involve optimizing policies for wildlife corridor construction, which is a problem in robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
