This involves the use of computer vision techniques, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the potential impact of this approach on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) for object detection. Additionally, the paper touches on the use of digital technologies in engineering design research (cs.CY) and the analysis of large datasets (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
