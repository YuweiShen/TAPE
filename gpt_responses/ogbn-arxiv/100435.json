This involves training an RL agent on small problem instances that can be simulated on a classical computer, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of variational circuits and optimization routines also suggests a connection to optimization (cs.OC) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the focus on combinatorial problems suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
