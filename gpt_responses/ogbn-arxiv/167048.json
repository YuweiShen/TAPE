Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also specifically mentions millimeter wave networks, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a tractable approach to evaluate the average achievable secrecy rate, which involves system modeling and analysis, and thus falls under the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
