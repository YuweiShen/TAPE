The use of submodular and subadditive valuations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of combinatorial optimization (cs.DS). The paper also presents a new proof technique, which may be of interest to researchers in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
