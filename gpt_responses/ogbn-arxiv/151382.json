The use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for event detection also suggests that the paper could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of gradient analysis, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
