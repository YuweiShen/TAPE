This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), augmented reality (cs.AR), and neural networks (cs.NE). However, given the focus on deep learning architectures and the use of low precision numerics, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
