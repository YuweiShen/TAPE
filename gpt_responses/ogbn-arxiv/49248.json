The paper also discusses secure multiparty computation, which is a well-known cryptographic technique for privacy-preserving computation. Therefore, cs.CR is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the distribution of personal data among several institutions and proposes a virtual entity called the Trustworthy responsible for the storage and computation of this data. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for secure multiparty computation. Therefore, cs.DS is the second most likely sub-category.\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the storage and computation of personal data by multiple institutions, which involves designing secure and efficient database systems. Therefore, cs.DB is the third most likely sub-category.\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the issue of power asymmetry between entities that gather and process personal data and individuals from which this data is issued. The paper proposes a crypto-democracy model to address this issue, which has implications for the social and ethical aspects of computing. Therefore, cs.CY is the fourth most likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the distribution of personal data among multiple institutions and proposes a virtual entity called the Trustworthy responsible"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
