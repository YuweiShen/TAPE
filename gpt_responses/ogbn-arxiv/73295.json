The paper specifically focuses on the impact of channel non-reciprocity and imperfect channel state information on the system performance, which are important issues in the design and optimization of wireless communication systems. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
