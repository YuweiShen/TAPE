The approach involves assigning fragility functions to buildings based on their characteristics and using optimization to minimize expected loss to the community. This methodology can be considered as a computational engineering problem, making cs.CE the most likely category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography or security, the concept of resilience is closely related to security. The paper discusses how a resilient community can absorb, recover from, and adapt to a disruptive event. Therefore, cs.CR is a possible category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses optimization techniques to minimize expected loss to the community. This involves making decisions based on limited information, which is a common problem in AI. Therefore, cs.AI is a possible category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the resilience of communities, which can be considered as social networks. The methodology proposed in the paper can be used to allocate resources to achieve desirable resiliency goals of the community. Therefore, cs.SI is a possible category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper does not deal with software engineering directly, but the methodology proposed in the paper can be implemented using software tools. Therefore, cs.SE is a possible"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
