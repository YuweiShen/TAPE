The use of geometric families such as axis-aligned rectangles and half planes suggests a connection to computational geometry as well (cs.CG). The reduction in size of the eps-approximations is likely achieved through data structures and algorithms, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.GR). The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as geo-spatial analysis and sensor networks, suggest a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
