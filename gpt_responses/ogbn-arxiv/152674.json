The approach is based on deep learning, which involves training a neural network to identify complex patterns and features in the data. This falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions that the approach requires no expert domain knowledge, which suggests that it may be applicable to a wide range of software systems, including those outside of the security domain. This could potentially fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
