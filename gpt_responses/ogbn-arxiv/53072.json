This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses techniques from the field of Continual Learning (CL) to improve the ability of Deep Learning models to generalize to data from a new domain, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from radiology reports, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of joint training and elastic weight consolidation, which are techniques commonly used in continual learning (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
