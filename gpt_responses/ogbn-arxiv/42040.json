The use of CNF formulas and semidefinite programming relaxations suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The mention of polynomial calculus and Sherali-Adams suggests a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of SOS proofs and degree bounds suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of a restriction argument suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
