Therefore, it is likely to be classified under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also presents a characterization of plane triangulations admitting a windrose-planar drawing, which involves graph theory (cs.GT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, windrose-planar drawings allow for the visualization of partial orders defined by the edges of the graph, which relates to information science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
