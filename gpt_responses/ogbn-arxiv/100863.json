It also leverages AI techniques (cs.AI) to overcome the lack of natural solution concepts in multi-type housing markets. The study also involves investigating computational complexity (cs.DS) of checking whether an allocation is in the strict core and checking whether the strict core is empty. Finally, the paper deals with designing mechanisms for allocation (cs.EC) and assumes natural preferences of agents (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
