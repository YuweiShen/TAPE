The paper proposes a new dynamic algorithm that achieves the broadcast capacity when the underlying network topology is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This problem is closely related to the field of network information theory (cs.IT) and network optimization (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of local queue-length information and the absence of work-conservation principle, which are relevant to the field of distributed computing (cs.DC) and self-organizing systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a polynomial time algorithm for computing the broadcast capacity of any wireless DAG under the primary interference constraints, which is related to the field of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
