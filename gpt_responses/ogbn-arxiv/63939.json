This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with detecting partially cropped and occluded faces captured using a smartphone's front-facing camera. This involves multimedia processing and analysis. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper proposes a method for continuous authentication using facial recognition. This has implications for security and cryptography. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper deals with detecting users' faces on mobile devices, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper involves processing and analyzing visual data to detect faces, which can be considered a form of information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
