The paper also uses properties of Hasse derivatives, which are commonly used in algebraic coding theory, and has connections to Reed-Solomon codes, Reed-Muller codes, and repeated-root cyclic codes, which are all topics in coding theory and could potentially place the paper in the data structures (cs.DS), distributed computing (cs.DC), cryptography (cs.CR), or social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
