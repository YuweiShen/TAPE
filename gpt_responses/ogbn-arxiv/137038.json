The proposed framework involves training the network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a small set of expert-level clean annotations, which is a problem of learning from noisy data (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a spatially adaptive reweighting approach and a meta-learning approach, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI). The task of medical image segmentation is also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
