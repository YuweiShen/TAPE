The use of weakly-supervised learning and attention mechanisms are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The potential applications of this work in surveillance and human-robot interactions suggest that it could also fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of RGBD data in one of the datasets indicates that this paper could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
