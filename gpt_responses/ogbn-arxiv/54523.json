It also proposes a mathematical formalisation of the theory, which is a common approach in cryptography and security research.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the social implications of surveillance and the role of identifiers in social contexts. This makes cs.SI a likely category.\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the social questions raised by surveillance and the role of formal methods in sociological contexts. This makes cs.CY a likely category.\n4. cs.CS (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes a mathematical formalisation of the theory of surveillance and identity. This makes cs.CS a possible category.\n5. cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the social implications of surveillance and the role of formal methods in sociological contexts.
