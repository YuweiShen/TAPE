The use of coding theory to mitigate stragglers is a key aspect of the paper, which makes it relevant to the subfield of coding theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the challenge of tackling stragglers in massive-scale elastic and serverless systems, which falls under the domain of distributed systems (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
