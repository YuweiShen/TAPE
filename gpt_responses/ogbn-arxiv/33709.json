The use of neural networks for melodic phrase segmentation is a common technique in this field, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.SD (Sound). Additionally, the paper proposes tailored label engineering and training techniques for different neural networks, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the issue of sparse labeling in training sets, which is a common problem in information retrieval, and could place it under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
