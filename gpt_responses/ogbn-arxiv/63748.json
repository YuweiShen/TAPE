The paper also proposes an online scheduling strategy that involves working with large amounts of data in real-time, which is a topic of interest in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the challenges of statistics estimation and source permutation, which are relevant topics in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper proposes a strategy for minimizing time cost, which is a common goal in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a practical approach for integrating big data, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
