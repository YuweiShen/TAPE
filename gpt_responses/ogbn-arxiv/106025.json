The use of algorithms such as Spearman's rank correlation and Dendritic Cell Algorithm suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The detection of keylogging and packet flooding behaviour involves network intrusion detection (cs.NI) and the analysis of system behaviour (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
