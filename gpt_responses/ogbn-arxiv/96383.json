Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely category. The paper also introduces the notion of stability for MEB and presents sampling algorithms for computing approximate MEB with sample complexities independent of the number of input points, which are related to topics in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions beyond worst-case analysis, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.SI) and the sandwich lemma, which is a technique used in combinatorics and optimization (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
