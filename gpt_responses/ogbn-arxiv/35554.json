Specifically, it focuses on the effect of activation functions on the training of overparametrized neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV) and the importance of understanding the impact of activation functions on training for practical applications (cs.DS, Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
