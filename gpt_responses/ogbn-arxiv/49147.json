The method also utilizes self-supervision, which involves training without explicit labels, and can be categorized under machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of similar patches across consecutive frames, which can be considered as a form of pattern recognition and can be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves signal processing techniques such as denoising, which can be categorized under information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
