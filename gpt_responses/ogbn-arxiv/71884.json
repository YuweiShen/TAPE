Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT), millimeter-wave technology (cs.MM), and algorithms (cs.AR) for optimizing the initial access process. Additionally, the paper performs a coverage and delay analysis, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
