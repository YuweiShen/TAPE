Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is a popular deep learning technique, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The application of pedestrian detection is relevant to robotics, making cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of a low computational platform for testing the system suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
