The use of multiple graphs and the need for a weighing scheme suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The scalability of the proposed method suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve image data, suggesting that the paper may also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
