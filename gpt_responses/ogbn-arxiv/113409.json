The use of sketches based on coordinated random samples is a classic technique for approximate query processing, which is relevant to the database (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of various aggregates such as Jaccard coefficient and association rules, which are relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The derivation of novel estimators and their analytical evaluation falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.DB, cs.DS, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
