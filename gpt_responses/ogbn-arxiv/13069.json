Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses model compression and model analyses, which are topics that fall under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions cross-lingual polyglot pre-training, which is relevant to the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper briefly touches on the application of contextual embeddings in computer vision tasks, which falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
