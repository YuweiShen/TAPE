The solution involves building a data structure (cs.DS) that can handle a set of pairwise disjoint unit disks, and using it to preprocess the input points. The algorithmic techniques used include recursive space decomposition (cs.DM), convex layers (cs.GR), and fast union of onion decompositions (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
