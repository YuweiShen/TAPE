The paper specifically focuses on the use of compound sources, which are sources with unknown statistics, and the use of one-way public communication. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of multi-letter capacity formulas, which are commonly used in the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of degraded compound sources, which are commonly studied in the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
