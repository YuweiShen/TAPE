The paper proposes a new quantization scheme called nested dithered quantization (NDQSG) and studies its convergence properties. This work is closely related to the field of machine learning, specifically distributed training, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of quantization and communication reduction techniques, which are relevant to the fields of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves the study of stochastic gradients, which is relevant to the field of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method to computer vision tasks, which falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
