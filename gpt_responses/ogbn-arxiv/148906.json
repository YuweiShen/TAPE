This suggests a connection to AI. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of graph operations and transformations to reduce property graph queries to flat relational algebra, which involves data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of discrimination networks and the focus on applications with near real-time requirements (e.g. fraud detection, recommendation systems) suggest a connection to machine learning. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a prototype tool, ingraph, which uses openCypher as a graph query language. This suggests a connection to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
