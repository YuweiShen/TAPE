Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the potential security implications of Interest aggregation, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. Additionally, the paper uses mathematical models and simulations to analyze the performance of Interest aggregation, which could place it in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the growth of Pending Interest Tables, which could place it in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
