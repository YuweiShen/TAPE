This falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents an abstract scenario called the exclusive call center problem, which captures the attack's root cause. This involves analyzing and designing data structures and algorithms to prevent the attack, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the disclosure of information in messaging systems, which falls under the scope of information theory.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the compromise of a user's friend and how it can be used to learn information about the user's ongoing conversations.
