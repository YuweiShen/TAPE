The paper discusses a scalable approach to learn video-based question answering, which involves natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language) and \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) and \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper involves training and evaluating various machine learning models and deals with information retrieval from video descriptions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
