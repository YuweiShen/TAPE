The proposed system design leverages the scalability advantage of image retrieval and accuracy of 3D model-based localization, which involves robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a new hashing-based cascade search and a new one-many RANSAC algorithm, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with urban localization, which is related to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
