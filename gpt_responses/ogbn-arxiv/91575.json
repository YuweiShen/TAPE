Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper also discusses the implementation guide for these Riemannian gradient descents, which falls under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
