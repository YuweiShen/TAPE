This involves adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained for image classification to learn discriminative regions from the activation maps of convolution units at different scales, and identifying the true nodule location with a novel candidate-screening framework. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, medical imaging (cs.MS) and multimedia (cs.MM) could also be relevant sub-categories given the focus on lung CT scans and nodule segmentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
