The paper also involves modelling and optimization, which are topics related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper discusses the utilities of different groups of mobile terminals, which can be seen as a social network analysis problem (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents numerical examples to compare different cases, which can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
