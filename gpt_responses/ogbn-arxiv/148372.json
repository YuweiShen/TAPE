Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also proposes a new achievable scheme, which involves the creation-resurrection of interference, and investigates the availability of channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), which are topics related to network information theory and signal processing. Therefore, the other likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
