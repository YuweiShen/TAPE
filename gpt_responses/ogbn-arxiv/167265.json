The paper proposes a two-stage framework for addressing this problem, which involves identifying a small portion of images with correct labels and then training a deep neural network in a semi-supervised manner. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given that the paper focuses on deep neural networks and image classification, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
