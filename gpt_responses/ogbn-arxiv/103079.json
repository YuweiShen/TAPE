The paper proposes a framework for uncertainty-based OOD classification, which is a common topic in the machine learning community and falls under the category of \"Learning\" (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed framework in autonomous systems, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of uncertainty estimation methods, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of safety in autonomous systems, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
