The use of visual-inertial tracking suggests computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant. The mention of a moving horizon estimator and nonlinear optimization suggests control systems (cs.SY) may be relevant. The use of a modular framework and the ability to scale estimate quality with computing power suggests machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
