Therefore, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also focuses on the performance aspects of the protocol, such as high throughput and low latency, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.OS (Operating Systems). Additionally, the paper mentions fault-tolerance and linearizability, which are important topics in distributed systems, and could place it in the sub-categories of cs.Distributed and cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
