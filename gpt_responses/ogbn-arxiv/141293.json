The paper focuses on the k-Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments (k-FAST) problem, which is a specific variant of the Feedback Arc Set problem. The paper presents a kernelization algorithm for k-FAST, which is a technique commonly used in parameterized complexity and is closely related to the design of efficient algorithms for NP-hard problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
