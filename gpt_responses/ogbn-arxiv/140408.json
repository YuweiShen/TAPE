The paper also discusses interference cancellation schemes and transceiver structures, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of millimeter-wave technology also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) as it enables the transmission of high-bandwidth multimedia content. The paper also discusses the practical and regulatory challenges of establishing a hybrid HetNet, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR) as it involves the design and implementation of a network infrastructure. Finally, the paper discusses the performance advantage of hybrid HetNets, which is related to computer communications (cs.COMM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
