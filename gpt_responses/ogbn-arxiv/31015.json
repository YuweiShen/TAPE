The paper proposes a new method called Core Influence to break down the Leaf-Removal cores, which is a structural feature of the graphs. This method uses a localized and greedy strategy to identify significant nodes and decomposes the minimal vertex-cover problem into two processes. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with the minimal vertex-cover problem, which is a fundamental problem in discrete mathematics. \n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new method to solve the minimal vertex-cover problem, which involves designing efficient algorithms and data structures. \n\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a heuristic method to solve the minimal vertex-cover problem, which is a well-known NP problem. \n\n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the structural features of graphs and proposes a method to break down the Leaf-Removal cores, which is a geometric problem. \n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of identifying significant nodes in a graph, which is a common problem in social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
