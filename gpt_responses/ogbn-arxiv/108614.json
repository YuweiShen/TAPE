Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses fixpoint operators and lattices, which are topics commonly found in cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). The paper also touches on software engineering (cs.SE) and formal methods (cs.FL) in the context of using formal semantics as specifications and interpreters."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
