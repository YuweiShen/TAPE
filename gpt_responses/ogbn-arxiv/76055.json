Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also addresses the hardware cost and power consumption issues, which are related to system design and control, suggesting cs.SY (Systems and Control) as another possible sub-category. Moreover, the paper focuses on the use of mmWave technology, which is a subfield of wireless communication and networking, indicating cs.MM (Multimedia) as a potential sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for binary analog precoder and combiner optimization, which involves optimization and search algorithms, suggesting cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
