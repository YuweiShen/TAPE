The use of beamforming and large antenna arrays in mmW communication also relates to the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.AR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper analyzes and compares different beamforming schemes based on power consumption, which can be considered a system-level design problem (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
