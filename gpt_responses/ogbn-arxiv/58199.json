Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new formal definition of a near duplicate and uses pattern-based techniques, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of templates for unification and automatic generation of documentation, which could be relevant to cybernetics (cs.CY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
