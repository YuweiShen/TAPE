The paper also discusses type checking and type inference, which are core topics in programming languages.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions constraint solving, which is a topic in logic and automated reasoning. The use of a first-order theory of naturals and real numbers also suggests a connection to logic.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions differential privacy, which is a topic in cryptography and security. DFuzz is a language for differential privacy, and the paper discusses how the type system can enforce differential privacy properties.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions implicit complexity, which is a topic in the analysis of algorithms. The use of linear types and type-level indices can also be seen as a way to reason about data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions subtyping, which is a topic in type systems and programming languages, but also has connections to systems and control theory. The use of subtyping can be seen as a way to make types more flexible and allow for more complex program properties to be enforced."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
