This falls under the domain of robotics.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The proposed solution is based on artificial potential field and associates each feature in the current image frame with an attractive or neutral potential energy. This involves computer vision techniques.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of artificial potential field for active visual navigation involves AI techniques.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, but the proposed solution involves learning from the environment and adapting the behavior of the vehicle accordingly.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a solution for controlling the behavior of a mini quadrotor based on visual features and potential field. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
