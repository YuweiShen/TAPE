The focus on scalability and distributed algorithms suggests a connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG) as well. Finally, the analysis of different data partitioning strategies could also be relevant to the field of social networks (cs.SI), where similar techniques are used to partition large graphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
