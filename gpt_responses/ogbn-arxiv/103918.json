The focus is on piecewise i.i.d. reward distributions with unknown changepoints, which is a specific sub-problem within the broader context of multi-armed bandits. The paper proposes new algorithms and regret bounds for this problem, which is a typical topic in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), statistics (cs.ST), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
