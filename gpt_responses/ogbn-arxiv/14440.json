This involves the use of neural networks to provide simultaneous and proportional control of six degrees of freedom. The paper also highlights the challenges associated with collecting consistent data and estimating motor intent reliably over time. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is robotics (cs.RO), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), neuroscience (cs.NE), and bioengineering (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
