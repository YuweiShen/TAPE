This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of a phrase-critic model and a ranking loss function suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
