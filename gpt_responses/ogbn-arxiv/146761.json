The use of foveated image sampling is specifically aimed at improving performance in embedded systems, such as mobile robots (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the computational challenges of implementing these algorithms, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method is done on the Microsoft COCO database, which is a common dataset used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
