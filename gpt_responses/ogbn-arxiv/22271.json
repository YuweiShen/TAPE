However, the paper also focuses on the mathematical analysis of the approximation rate, which suggests a focus on numerical analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). Overall, the paper seems to fit best under cs.IT, as it deals with approximation theory and quantifying the improvement of approximation rates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
