This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper presents a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing the invertibility of symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, which is a fundamental problem in computational complexity. This makes cs.CC a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\ncs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with algorithmic questions related to symbolic matrices, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms. This makes cs.DS a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\ncs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with the word problem for the free skew field, which is a topic in logic in computer science. This makes cs.LO a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\ncs.QA (Quantum Algebra): The paper mentions that symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables have applications in quantum information theory, which suggests that cs.QA could be a relevant sub-category for this paper.\n\ncs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions that symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables have applications in linear system theory, which suggests that cs"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
