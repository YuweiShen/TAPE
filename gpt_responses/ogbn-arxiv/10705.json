This is a classic problem in information theory and hence cs.IT is the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the impact of feedback delay on the performance of interference management techniques such as multiuser MIMO and interference alignment. This is a relevant topic in networking and hence cs.NI is a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of feedback delay in a MIMO broadcast channel with multiple receivers. This is a relevant problem in social and information networks where multiple users may be accessing a common resource. Hence, cs.SI is a possible sub-category. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the impact of feedback delay on the performance of MIMO broadcast channels. This is a relevant topic in multimedia communication where multiple streams of data may be transmitted simultaneously. Hence, cs.MM is a possible sub-category. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper proposes a new scheme for utilizing stale channel state information in a MIMO broadcast channel. This is a relevant problem in computational engineering and science"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
