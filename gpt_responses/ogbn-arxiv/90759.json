The use of sketching methods is inspired by sub-linear/streaming algorithms, which suggests a potential connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the convergence rates of Sketched SGD, which could be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
