This involves addressing two major weaknesses of the canonical Transformer architecture: locality-agnostics and memory bottleneck. The proposed method involves convolutional self attention and LogSparse Transformer. These techniques are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
