This involves exploiting redundancies in the light field images by constructing a tree structure and using bounded integer sequence encoding. The paper is likely to belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories as it deals with image compression and rendering. It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories as it involves processing and manipulating images. Additionally, it may belong to Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category as it involves encoding and decoding of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
