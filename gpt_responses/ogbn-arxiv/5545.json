However, the use of regression models and local topological features suggests that the paper is more likely to belong to the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the use of artificial graphs and experimental results on real and synthetic networks suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Network Economics (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
