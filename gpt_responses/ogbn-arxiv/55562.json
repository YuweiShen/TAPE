The proposed infrastructure also involves communication and data management, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The privacy concerns also relate to cryptography (cs.CY) and machine learning (cs.LG) as the paper proposes two instantiations that attain privacy guarantees with provable security at low computational cost."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
