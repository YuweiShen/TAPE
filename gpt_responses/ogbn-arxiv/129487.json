It also involves the coordination and management of distributed deep learning jobs, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) categories. The paper also mentions the use of a control layer for coordination and management, which could be related to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of elasticity to adjust the parallelism of jobs, which is a common technique in the field of Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
