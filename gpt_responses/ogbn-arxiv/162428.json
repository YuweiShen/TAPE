It also proposes a novel training procedure to update the parameters of the network. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the framework incorporates multi-view generation and can incorporate Convolutional based models. \n\nAdditionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a new approach to generative modeling. \n\nIt may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it can incorporate (deep) neural network models. \n\nFinally, it could belong to cs.SD (Sound) as the framework can be applied to generate audio samples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
