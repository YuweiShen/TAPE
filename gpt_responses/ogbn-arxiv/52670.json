The paper focuses on the use of classification and regression approaches for query-based extractive summarization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (LG) techniques, which makes cs.IR and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for text summarization, which makes cs.AI a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the processing of large amounts of data, which makes cs.DB (Databases) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
