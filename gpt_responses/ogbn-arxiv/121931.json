The paper also explores the impact of different action parameterizations on learning and performance, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves processing high-dimensional state descriptors. Additionally, the paper evaluates the policies in terms of robustness and motion quality, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
