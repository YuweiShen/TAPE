The use of frictional contacts and quasi-static analysis suggests that the paper may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Mechanical Engineering (cs.ME) sub-categories. The derivation of a hybrid dynamical system and the study of fixed-points and paths suggest that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) or Control Engineering (cs.CE) sub-categories. Finally, the experimental validation of the model suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as it involves the use of visual feedback and sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
