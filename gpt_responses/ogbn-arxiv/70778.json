The proposed loss term aims to improve the discriminative power of the learned representations, which is a key aspect of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of off-the-shelf architectures, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on a benchmark dataset, which is a common practice in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
