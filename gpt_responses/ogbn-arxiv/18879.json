This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel optimization problem to extract batches of samples with mutually consistent relations, which involves learning cliques and consolidating transitivity relations. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper applies the proposed approach to posture analysis and object classification, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
