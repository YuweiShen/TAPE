The use of theta series and flatness factor also suggests a connection to Number Theory (cs.NT). The study of maximum-likelihood decoding and the use of matrix decomposition suggest a connection to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC), respectively. Finally, the examination of candidate lattices for code design suggests a connection to Multimedia (cs.MM), as lattice codes are often used in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
