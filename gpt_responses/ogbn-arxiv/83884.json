The methodology proposed involves the use of Dropout regularization and Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for sampling complex posterior distributions. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
