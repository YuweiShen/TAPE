The use of deterministic equivalents and iterative water-filling algorithm suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) as another likely sub-category. The consideration of strong correlation patterns at both communication sides suggests signal processing (cs.SI) as a possible sub-category. The use of multiple antennas and multiple access channels suggests multimedia (cs.MM) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the analysis of communication channels suggests computer networking and communications (cs.COM) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
