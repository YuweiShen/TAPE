The use of Gaussian channels and the consideration of a wire-tapper also suggest that the paper could belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a protocol for generating a common secret key from received signals, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of channels and the generation of a secret key could also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
