The use of multiple antennas and the analysis of the impact of transmit-side channel correlation suggest a focus on the areas of multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the optimization of the regularization parameter and the comparison with other precoding techniques indicate a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
