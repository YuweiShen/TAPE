This involves combining both local and global context to obtain a representation of the ROI and using Relation Networks (RNs) to predict the corresponding anatomy of the ROI based on its relationship score for each class. The paper also proposes a novel strategy employing nearest neighbors approach for training RNs. Given these details, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) for the development of the methodology. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) in terms of the use of text-based datasets for evaluation purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
