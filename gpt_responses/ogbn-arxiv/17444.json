The use of convex programming is also a key aspect of the paper, which is a common technique in optimization and algorithms research (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the size of the set where signals reside, which is a topic related to computational geometry and topology (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents theoretical results and analysis, which is a common theme in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
