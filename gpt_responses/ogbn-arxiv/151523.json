Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also uses count-sketch, a hash-based compression scheme, and structured polynomial codes, which are related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of structured codes to guarantee the independence of resulting count-sketches, which is related to Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical characterization of the accuracy of the result and the recovery threshold achieved by the proposed scheme, which is related to Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
