The use of rational belief updating by voters suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The consideration of different voting rules and the analysis of computational complexity suggest the involvement of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The concept of signaling and information transmission suggests the involvement of information theory (cs.IT) and social influence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
