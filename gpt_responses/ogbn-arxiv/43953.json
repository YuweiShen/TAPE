The study of noise densities, including unimodal and spherically invariant noise, suggests that the paper may also belong to the Statistics (cs.ST) sub-category. The investigation of convexity properties in signal amplitude and noise power may suggest a connection to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the discussion of applications of the results may suggest a connection to the Modeling and Simulation (cs.MS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
