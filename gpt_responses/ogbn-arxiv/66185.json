This involves learning the reward function from the actions of an expert running a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without knowledge of the system dynamics of the agent. The paper also presents experimental results on standard benchmarks such as objectworld and pendulum, indicating that the proposed algorithm can effectively learn the latent reward function in complex, high-dimensional environments. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves image processing and control systems, which suggest that cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
