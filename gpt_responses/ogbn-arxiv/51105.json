This involves image classification and detection tasks, which are commonly associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also introduces new convolution and pooling methods, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
