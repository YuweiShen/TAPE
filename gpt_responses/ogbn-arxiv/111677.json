The proposed method also involves using convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and semantic information (cs.AI) to guide the training of the network. Additionally, the paper evaluates the method on large-scale datasets (cs.IR) and conducts experiments on fine-grained classification (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
