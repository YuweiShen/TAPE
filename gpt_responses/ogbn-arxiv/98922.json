The paper deals with a question answering task on real-world images using a combination of image representation and natural language processing. This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes an end-to-end formulation using neural networks, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also analyzes human consensus and proposes novel metrics, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
