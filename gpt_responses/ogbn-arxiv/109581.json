The use of Steane-enlargement is a technique used in quantum error correction, which is also studied in the quantum physics (quant-ph) sub-category. The paper also involves the computation of parameters of codes, which is a topic studied in the algorithms (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper compares the parameters of the codes to relevant codes in the literature, which is a topic studied in the coding theory (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
