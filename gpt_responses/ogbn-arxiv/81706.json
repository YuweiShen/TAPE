The paper proposes a new architecture for deep reinforcement learning called Gossip-based Actor-Learner Architectures (GALA). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
