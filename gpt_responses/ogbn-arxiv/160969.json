The use of tabulation-based hash functions is common in data structures and algorithms, which suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a likely category. The paper also involves linear maps over finite fields, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The analysis of the hash functions involves algebraic and geometric arguments, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper involves numerical computations, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
