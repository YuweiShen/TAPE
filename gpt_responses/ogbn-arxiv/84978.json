The problem of group testing with sum observations is a combinatorial optimization problem, which is often studied in computer science (cs.DS). The paper also discusses non-adaptive and adaptive policies, which are common in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper applies the procedures to a stylized computer vision problem, which falls under the computer vision and pattern recognition category (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
