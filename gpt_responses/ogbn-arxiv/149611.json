The proposed algorithm also uses a modified simplified swarm optimization (cs.NE) to help train the model. The experiments conducted in the paper evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on five benchmark databases for the classification problem, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
