This involves utilizing both spatial and temporal information from multiple adjacent frames. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves developing a deep neural network, which falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
