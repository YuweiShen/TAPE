This involves leveraging multi-modal sensing capabilities for state estimation, tight integration with digital building models, and integrated trajectory planning and whole-body motion control. These topics are all related to robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), control systems (cs.SY), machine learning (cs.MA), and possibly also statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
