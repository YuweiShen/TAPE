Theoretical features of the model are explored, such as convergence guarantees and quality of the final decision. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the behavior of rational voting bots and real voters in a user study, which falls under the domain of AI. \n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The committee decision-making process involves multiple agents (committee members) interacting with each other, which is a typical scenario in multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper studies the behavior of different types of committee members (lazy vs. proactive voters) and how it affects the decision-making process, which can be viewed as a social network analysis problem. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a time-bounded iterative voting process for consensus-seeking in committees, which involves designing algorithms and data structures to implement the process efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
