The use of the ReLU activation function is also a common technique in deep learning, which suggests that the paper may be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the approximation capabilities of neural networks, which is a topic that falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the stability of the realization map, which is a topic that falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
