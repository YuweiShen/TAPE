This involves the use of cooperative and cognitive techniques to boost the performance of multibeam satellite constellations. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
