However, the paper does use the term \"resource management\", which could be interpreted as related to information theory. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper is not directly related to natural language processing or computational linguistics, but the use of lambda calculus and type systems could be seen as relevant to the study of formal languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
