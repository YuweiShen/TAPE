The paper also discusses the importance of explicitly learning the classification uncertainty, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the subjective definitions of disease appearance, which suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of uncertainty-driven bootstrapping, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
