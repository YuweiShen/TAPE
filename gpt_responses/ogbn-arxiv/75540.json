Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The problem also involves handling large datasets, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the second likely sub-category. The use of information theory concepts such as the Chernoff Information and large-deviation principle suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as the third likely sub-category.
