This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Game Theory sub-category.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses string diagrams to represent open games, which are a type of graphical notation commonly used in category theory and related to logic. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Logic in Computer Science sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of game theory and theoretical computer science methods in large-scale economic models, which is a topic of interest to the Artificial Intelligence community.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a new compositional approach to game theory, which may involve the development of new algorithms and data structures for representing and manipulating open games.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper introduces the concept of coutility, which is the utility generated by an open game and returned to its environment. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Systems and Control sub-category, which deals with the analysis and design of systems that interact with their environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
