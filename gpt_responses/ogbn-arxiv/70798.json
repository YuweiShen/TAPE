The proposed framework involves the use of a Multi-granularity Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) and a deep Long Short Term Memory network. These are commonly used techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper focuses on the analysis of facial expressions and head pose, which are related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
