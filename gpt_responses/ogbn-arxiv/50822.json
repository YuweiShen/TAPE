However, the paper also discusses the use of parallelization as a mechanism for speeding up network training, which could fall under the categories of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper mentions applications of ANNs in domains such as medicine and autonomous transportation, which could fall under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
