The paper focuses on objective measures of research strength and their correlation with peer assessment of CS doctoral programs. The paper does not deal with any specific subfield of Computer Science, but rather with the field as a whole. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are those that cover general topics in Computer Science, such as cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
