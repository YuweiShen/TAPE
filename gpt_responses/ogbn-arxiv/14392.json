This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision category.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed algorithm has potential applications in robotics, as it can be used for tracking objects in a 3D space, which is relevant to robotics.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a Bayesian multi-view multi-object filtering algorithm, which involves probabilistic modeling and estimation. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed algorithm involves intelligent decision-making based on probabilistic modeling and estimation, which is relevant to the Artificial Intelligence category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed algorithm can be used for tracking objects in a multi-camera system, which involves control and coordination of multiple sensors.
