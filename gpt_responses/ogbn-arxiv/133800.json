The paper also considers the issue of information leakage and eavesdropping, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper introduces a new coding scheme that combines wiretap coding and key extraction, which are topics in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the interplay between different types of randomness and tradeoffs between reliability and secrecy, which are topics in statistical inference (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
