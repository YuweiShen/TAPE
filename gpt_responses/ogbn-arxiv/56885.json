This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also proposes knowledge distillation techniques to improve the performance of person search models, which involves training a smaller student model to mimic the behavior of a larger teacher model. This falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also evaluates its proposed approach on benchmark datasets, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of current joint optimization methods for person search, which involves analyzing the performance of optimization algorithms, and this falls under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
