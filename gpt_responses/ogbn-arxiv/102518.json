The paper also discusses the importance of gradient propagation, which suggests that it may be relevant to optimization (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a solution to address the collapse of auxiliary samples, which may be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on image registration and classification tasks suggests that it may be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
