The focus is on human-robot interactions, which suggests the sub-category of Robotics (cs.RO) as the most likely. The use of Deep Reinforcement Learning and the proposed reward function also suggest the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as likely. The use of motion capture data and the evaluation of natural-looking motions suggest the sub-categories of Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) as possible as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
