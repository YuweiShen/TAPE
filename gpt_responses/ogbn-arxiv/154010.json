The use of reward distributions and the need for computationally efficient algorithms suggest that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The problem of ranking and sorting items is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of sampling and the need for efficient algorithms suggest that this paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
