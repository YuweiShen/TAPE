This involves the use of information theory and communication networks, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.IT and cs.NI. The paper also proposes various compression strategies and considers the use of distributed source coding, which falls under the sub-category cs.SI. Additionally, the paper deals with the optimization of joint encoding and decoding in the uplink, which is related to the sub-categories cs.MM and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
