The proposed models use knowledge graph embeddings (KGE), which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions resolving ambiguity, which is a common challenge in knowledge representation (cs.KR). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed models through experiments, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
