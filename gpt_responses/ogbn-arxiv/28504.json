The paper also mentions the use of deep neural models (cs.LG) and gated graph neural networks (cs.SY) for this purpose. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Daikon, a dynamic invariant detection tool (cs.PL), and the generation of labeled invariants using large test-suites (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
