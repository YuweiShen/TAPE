This topic is closely related to information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (SI) techniques for analyzing large datasets. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of statistical methods for evaluating and comparing different proximity measures, which falls under the category of data analysis and statistics (SD). The paper also mentions the use of network maps for analyzing the diversification of technology domains, which could be relevant to the field of cybersecurity (CY) and digital libraries (DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
