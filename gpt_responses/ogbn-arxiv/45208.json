This suggests that the paper may belong to the Numerical Analysis sub-category.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper introduces a method for approximating a given function by a nomographic function, which involves a combination of a dimensionwise function decomposition and optimization over a class of monotone polynomials. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Symbolic Computation sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions an example of applying the proposed algorithm to solve problems in distributed function computation over multiple-access channels.
