Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an unsupervised Bag-of-Words representation, which involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, making cs.IR another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with datasets and includes a new high-quality dataset, which falls under multimedia (MM) and machine learning (LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency and security of the proposed method, which could be related to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
