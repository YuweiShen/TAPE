It also uses formal logic and mathematical frameworks, which are common in the subfield of logic and computation (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the connection between iterated revision and the axiom of recovery, which is relevant to the subfield of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper discusses the syntactical properties of the framework, which is relevant to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC).
