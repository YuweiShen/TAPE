The paper specifically focuses on dynamic analysis on real devices, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and software engineering (cs.SE) techniques. The comparative analysis of emulator-based vs. device-based detection also involves the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves the use of data collection and analysis techniques (cs.DC) to extract dynamic features from Android phones."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
