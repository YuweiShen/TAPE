Therefore, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper proposes two novel sampling frameworks for IM-based viral marketing problems, which involve innovative Stop-and-Stare strategy and use minimum numbers of samples, meeting strict theoretical thresholds characterized for IM. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses approximation algorithms and statistical evidence to evaluate the proposed frameworks, which are related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
