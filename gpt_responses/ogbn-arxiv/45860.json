The paper also discusses the use of hierarchical aggregation design, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of the UCF101 database for experiments suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
