It also involves the use of linear-feedback codes, which is a common technique in networking and communication systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the optimization problem involved in finding the linear-feedback sum-capacity, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of conditional maximal correlation, which is a statistical measure commonly used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of codes that achieve maximum sum-rate, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
