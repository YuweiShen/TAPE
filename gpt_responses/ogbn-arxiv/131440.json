The paper also focuses on achieving weak security against eavesdroppers, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses practical scenarios such as storing files on third-party cloud storage systems, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also deals with designing codes for minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, which is a topic in distributed storage (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of small field sizes, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
