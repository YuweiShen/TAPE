It may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as it proposes a distributed variant of the Hessian-free optimization method. Additionally, it may be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with deep neural networks. The paper also mentions the MNIST dataset and TIMIT speech recognition problem, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) research, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
