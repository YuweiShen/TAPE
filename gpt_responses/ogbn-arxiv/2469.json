The paper proposes a new method to solve this problem, which makes it highly likely to belong to this category. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The problem of reducing PAPR and CM in OFDM signals is a fundamental problem in communication systems. The paper proposes a new method to solve this problem, which makes it highly likely to belong to this category. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the problem of reducing PAPR and CM in OFDM signals, which is a signal processing problem. The paper proposes a new method to solve this problem, which makes it highly likely to belong to this category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new method to solve the problem of reducing PAPR and CM in OFDM signals, which involves the use of a surrogate metric and the Method of Conditional Expectations. This makes it possible that the paper belongs to this category. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of reducing PAPR and CM in OFDM signals, which is a fundamental problem in communication networks.
