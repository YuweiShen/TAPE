The experiments conducted in the paper are focused on image classification datasets, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the sample complexity of robust learning, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the model family and training algorithm, which are topics in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
