It also touches upon the semantical and computational aspects of default logic, which are topics covered in the subfields of logic (cs.LO) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also mentions failures in default logic, which can be related to the subfield of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the encoding of domains into default logic, which can be related to the subfield of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
