Specifically, it focuses on training deep neural networks for visual question answering tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
