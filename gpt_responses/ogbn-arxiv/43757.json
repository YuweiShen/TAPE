These problems are closely related to topics such as graph algorithms, computational complexity, and combinatorial optimization, which are all covered by various sub-categories in computer science. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.DM (discrete mathematics), cs.CG (computational geometry), cs.GT (computational complexity and cryptography), and cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
