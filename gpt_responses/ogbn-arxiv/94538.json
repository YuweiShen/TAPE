This is a topic that is closely related to social and information networks. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the scalability of their proposed framework, which involves storing user data on their devices rather than a centralized database. This is a topic that is closely related to databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
