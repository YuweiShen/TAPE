The use of information theory to quantify semantic structures and extract keywords also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of linguistic sequences and the measurement of entropy may also be relevant to the fields of computational complexity (cs.CC) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
