The use of planarity and non-negative edge weights suggests that the paper may belong to cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.CG (computational geometry). The focus on optimization and graph theory suggests that it may also belong to cs.DM (discrete mathematics) or cs.GT (computational complexity and cryptography). Finally, the use of numerical methods and analysis of algorithms suggests that it may belong to cs.NA (numerical analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
