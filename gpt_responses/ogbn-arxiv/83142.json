The use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes also suggests a possible categorization in the subfields of networked systems (cs.NI) and system and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also discusses the joint optimization of the LDPC and repetition (REP) codes, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for code design and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
