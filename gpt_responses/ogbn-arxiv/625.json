The use of MSO definable patterns and the typechecking problem also suggest a connection to logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of invisible pebbles to improve time complexity, which could be of interest to researchers in software engineering (cs.SE) looking to optimize algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
