DRL is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning. \n2. cs.LG: The paper proposes two novel DRL algorithms, FH-DDPG and FH-RDPG, to solve the finite-horizon Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model. Both algorithms are based on deep neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning and falls under the category of deep learning. \n3. cs.SY: The paper deals with the energy dispatch problem in isolated microgrids, which is a complex system with multiple components (diesel generators, photovoltaic panels, and a battery) that interact with each other. The proposed algorithms aim to optimize the system performance by making decisions based on the current state and future uncertainty. This falls under the category of control systems, which is a subfield of systems engineering. \n4. cs.DC: The paper uses historical data to learn from the past and make decisions for the future. This involves data processing, storage, and retrieval, which are all related to the field of data-centric computing. \n5. cs.ET: The paper deals with the energy management problem in isolated microgrids, which is a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
