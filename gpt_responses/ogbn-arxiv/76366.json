It also involves feature extraction and matching, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the addition of noise and compression, which are common techniques used in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of a contrario method for false alarm control is a statistical approach, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with unsupervised learning, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
