The paper proposes a novel end-to-end learnable feature aggregation scheme, which involves pooling second-order statistics, and explores higher-order extensions of this scheme. This suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper involves training a model to learn features, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it may also fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
