The algorithms combine universal prediction with recent work on online convex programming and do not require computing posterior distributions given all current observations. The proposed approach is based on exponential-family models which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications. The paper also proves bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and feedback signals. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
