This is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The proposed method can also improve the spectral efficiency of the system, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
