This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), networked systems (cs.NI), game theory (cs.GT), and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS). The paper also provides conditions for GDoF optimality for a new class of interference networks, which falls under the category of social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
