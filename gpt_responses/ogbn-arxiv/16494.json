This involves learning a state invariant dynamics model and an exploration distribution from human demonstrations, and using these to compute a search trajectory that is augmented with forces learnt through the dynamics model. The method is experimentally evaluated on a KUKA LWR4+ performing 2D and 3D assembly tasks. Given the focus on robotics and machine learning, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of computer vision techniques for the assembly tasks suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible sub-category, while the use of an impedance controller for reproducing the learnt strategy suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
