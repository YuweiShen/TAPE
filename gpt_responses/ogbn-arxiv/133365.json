It also mentions congestion control policies such as TCP, which falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of utility-based flow-level models suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The study of network performance and scheduling policies may fall under the Performance (cs.PF) sub-category. Finally, the mention of end-to-end bandwidth and flow-level dynamics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
