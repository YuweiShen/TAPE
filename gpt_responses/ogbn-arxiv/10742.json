The paper also discusses the implementation of the translation as Coq programs, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). The use of reification and reflection in the implementation suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions free theorems, which are related to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
