This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses physical layer techniques (cs.OH) and detection techniques (cs.SY) to combat the adverse effects of the atmosphere. Additionally, the paper mentions inter-satellite links (cs.RO), which is a sub-category of computer science that deals with space communication and navigation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
