The focus is on analyzing the impact of specific search strategies (footnote chasing and citation searching) on search performance, which is a common topic in IR research. The use of an academic search engine also suggests a focus on digital libraries (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) for academic texts. The social sciences domain of the search engine suggests a potential focus on computational social science (CY) or social computing (HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
