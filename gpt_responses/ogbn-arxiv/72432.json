The proposed solution aims to minimize the cost of the backhaul network while satisfying data rate, connectivity, and reliability constraints. This aligns with the scope of cs.NI.\n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the problem of maximizing the data rate while minimizing the cost of the backhaul network. This involves optimizing the use of different technologies, such as RF and FSO, and choosing the appropriate links between base-stations. This optimization problem can be viewed as an information-theoretic problem, which falls under the scope of cs.IT.\n\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper proposes a hybrid RF/FSO backhaul solution for next-generation backhaul systems. This solution combines the advantages of both RF and FSO technologies to achieve high data rates at a relatively low cost. This aligns with the scope of cs.COMM, which deals with the design and analysis of communication systems and networks.\n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the proposed solution can be applied to the backhaul networks of autonomous vehicles and drones, which are becoming increasingly important in the field of robotics.
