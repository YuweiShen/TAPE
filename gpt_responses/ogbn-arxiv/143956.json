The paper also proposes a globally convergent Douglas-Rachford scheme for solving the problem, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The regularizers used in the paper are based on metric interaction potentials, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses convex relaxations of the originally combinatorial problem, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a method for solving the problem that involves recovering a sequence of dual iterates, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
