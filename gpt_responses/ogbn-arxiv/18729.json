It also discusses the security and detection of hidden messages, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of watermarking codes and binning methods suggests a focus on multimedia security (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of linear codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the discussion of computational security suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
