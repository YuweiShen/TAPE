The most likely category is cs.AR (Architecture), as the paper focuses on developing a power-efficient computing paradigm. The next likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as the paper discusses solving systems of linear equations, which is a common problem in distributed computing. The third likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper discusses power profiling of applications at a fine-grain level, which is related to system-level optimization. The fourth likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper mentions the use of low-precision arithmetic, which is a common technique in machine learning. The fifth likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as the paper discusses the use of post-FLOPS/W metrics, which are commonly used in neural network training."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
