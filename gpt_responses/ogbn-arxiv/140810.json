The paper also involves the use of a population-based approach for training the agents, which falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The use of game points scored as input suggests the involvement of game theory, which falls under the cs.GT (Game Theory) sub-category. The use of pixels as input suggests the involvement of computer vision, which falls under the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the use of multiple agents learning and acting independently suggests the involvement of multi-agent systems, which falls under the cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
