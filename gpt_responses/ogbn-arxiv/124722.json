This falls under the purview of information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a key technology in future generation networks, i.e., massive MIMO. It also proposes a user scheduling algorithm to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate. These aspects are relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new approach for uplink training in a massive MIMO system, which involves the control of system parameters to optimize performance. This falls under the purview of systems and control. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of massive MIMO systems to cope with the ever-increasing wireless capacity demand. This is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and efficient transmission. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a user scheduling algorithm that exploits a coherence interval based grouping to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate.
