This involves image processing and machine learning, which are typically covered in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves simulations and experiments, which could fall under the modeling and simulation (cs.MS) sub-category. The use of ResNet, a popular deep learning architecture, could also place the paper under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
