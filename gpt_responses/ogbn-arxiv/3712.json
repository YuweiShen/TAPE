The paper proposes an end-to-end approach that involves training a target prediction network using a discriminative loss. The paper also discusses different fusion mechanisms at different levels of the framework. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques for tracking, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
