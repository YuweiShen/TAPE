The method is based on characterizing activity patterns by Gram matrices, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper proposes a method that is applicable across a variety of architectures and vision datasets, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
