The paper proposes a variational auto-encoding model for semisupervised semantic parsing, which involves learning from limited amounts of parallel data and readily-available unlabeled NL utterances. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to NLP, including syntax, semantics, discourse, dialogue, machine translation, and information retrieval. Semantic parsing is a subfield of NLP, so this is the most likely sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The paper proposes a variational auto-encoding model, which is a type of unsupervised learning, so this is also a likely sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to AI, including knowledge representation, reasoning, planning, and natural language processing. Semantic parsing is a subfield of NLP, which is a subfield of AI, so this is also a likely sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers topics related to computer vision, including image and video analysis, recognition, and understanding.
