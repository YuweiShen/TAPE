The method involves learning a low-dimensional latent variable that generates Q-functions, and finding a master policy that can adapt to different values of this latent variable. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
