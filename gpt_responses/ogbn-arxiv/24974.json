Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of learned features and correspondence pruning algorithms, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The proposed Coarse-to-Fine RANSAC estimator is related to robotics and control, making cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of different algorithms on large-scale datasets, which is related to multimedia and information retrieval, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
