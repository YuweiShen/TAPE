The paper also mentions the use of algebraically-defined binary trade strategies, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the transformation of a continuous numeric time-series classification problem to a vision problem, which could potentially fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
