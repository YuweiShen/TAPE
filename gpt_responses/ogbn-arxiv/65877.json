The use of right-angle crossings and few bends in the drawings suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of graph drawing and layout (cs.SI). The study of beyond-planar graphs, such as 1-planar, IC-planar, and NIC-planar graphs, involves combinatorial and structural aspects of graphs, which are also relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
