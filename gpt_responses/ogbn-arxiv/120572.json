The use of minimax techniques and the characterization of the maximization over a class of distributions suggest that this paper may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The study of probability distributions and their properties also suggests that this paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.ST) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of an algorithm to compute the optimal weight vector suggests that this paper may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
