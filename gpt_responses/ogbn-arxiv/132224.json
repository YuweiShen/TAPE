Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new framework for encoding multiple queries, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, making cs.AI a likely sub-category. The paper also evaluates its proposed method on two benchmarks, which involves information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques, making cs.IR and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
