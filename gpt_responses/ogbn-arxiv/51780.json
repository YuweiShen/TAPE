The paper proposes a sparse framework for modeling the localization of known waveforms over unknown multipath channels and develops a direct approach for joint localization of multiple sources. This work involves signal processing, optimization, and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to several subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
