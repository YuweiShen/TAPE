Additionally, the paper proposes improvements to the default parameter setting in CMA-ES, which is a common topic in the field of optimization. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of active CMA to guarantee positive definiteness of the covariance matrix, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nThe paper's focus on optimization and parameter tuning also makes it relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper's use of numerical experiments and analysis of algorithm performance makes it relevant to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
