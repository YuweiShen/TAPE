The paper proposes a new approach to NMT that involves bidirectional decoding, which is a technique commonly used in other NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. Therefore, it is also possible that this paper could be categorized under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) or \"Learning\" (cs.LG). The proposed model involves deep learning techniques such as attention mechanisms and transformer networks, which are also commonly used in computer vision tasks, so it is possible that this paper could also be categorized under \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) or \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
