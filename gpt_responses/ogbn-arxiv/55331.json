The paper mentions the use of the Finite Rate of Innovation framework, which is a subfield of CS and falls under the cs.IT category. The paper also discusses the use of beamforming, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the imaging of biological tissues, which falls under the cs.BIO category. Finally, the paper discusses the imaging of macroscopic perturbations, which could potentially fall under the cs.MM category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
