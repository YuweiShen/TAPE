The use of the secretary problem as a framework for these problems also suggests a connection to decision theory and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses approximation algorithms, which are a common topic in machine learning and theoretical computer science (cs.LG). Finally, the paper introduces a new parameter, the supermodular degree, which is defined in terms of information theory and has been previously studied in the context of approximation algorithms (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
