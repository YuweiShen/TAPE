The paper focuses on rotation-equivariant CNNs, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a decomposition of convolutional filters, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves image processing (cs.MM), which is another relevant sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
