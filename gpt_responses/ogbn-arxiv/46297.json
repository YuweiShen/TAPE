Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new approach for adaptation in NMT, which involves injecting task-specific adapter layers into a pre-trained model. This approach involves some level of machine learning, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on two tasks, one of which involves multilingual translation, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
