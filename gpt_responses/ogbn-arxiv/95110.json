The proposed method uses off-the-shelf approaches to detect visual elements and measure semantic similarity between categories of detected elements and words in phrases, which involves machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification, falling under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets, which involves evaluation metrics and statistical analysis, falling under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
