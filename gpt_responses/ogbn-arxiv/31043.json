Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The proposed Moment Alignment Network (MAN) is a deep learning model that involves feed-forward networks and iterative graph adjustment, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG and cs.IR. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach is done on two public benchmarks related to multimedia (MM), which makes cs.MM a likely sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
