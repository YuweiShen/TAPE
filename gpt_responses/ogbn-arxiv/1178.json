The method is evaluated on a challenging LP dataset collected from unconstrained surveillance scenes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with multimedia data, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper addresses security and privacy issues related to license plate recognition, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
