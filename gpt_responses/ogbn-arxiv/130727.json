This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the comparison of two popular segmentation frameworks, which involves machine learning and deep learning techniques, making the paper relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of open-source software and expert knowledge, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
