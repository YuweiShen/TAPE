This makes cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of tactics and decision procedures, which are commonly used in automated theorem proving, placing it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well. The paper also discusses the implementation of the technique as a tactic-level automation, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of machine learning to guide proof selection also falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
