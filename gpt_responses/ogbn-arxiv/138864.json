The proposed method involves transfer learning and graph reasoning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions linguistic relationships, which suggests a possible connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the experiments involve multiple object detection benchmarks, indicating a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
