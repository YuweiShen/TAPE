This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and specifically cross-lingual NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also mentions applications such as document retrieval and categorization, which are related to information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML), making cs.IR and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. The use of linguistic resources and text features also suggests a potential connection to machine translation (MT) and deep learning (DL), making cs.LG and cs.DL possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
