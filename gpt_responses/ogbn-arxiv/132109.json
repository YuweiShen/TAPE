It also involves designing mechanisms and algorithms to aggregate preferences, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of cardinal queries suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), while the optimization of distortion bounds involves mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
