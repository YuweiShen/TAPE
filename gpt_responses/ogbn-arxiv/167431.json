The use of genetic algorithms for code construction is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the decoding behavior of polar codes, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). The use of polar codes in communication systems is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different decoding algorithms, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
