The approach relies on onboard sensing and computing, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The quadrotor has to actively control its orientation towards the gap, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and decision making (cs.AI). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
