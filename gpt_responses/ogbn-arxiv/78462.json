Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to improve recognition accuracy, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The user study mentioned in the paper also suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of appearance-based features (Histogram of Gradients) and geometric features (Inter Vector Angles) suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
