The paper also introduces an occlusion-aware optical flow learning method, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed framework is end-to-end trainable, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.MM, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
