This involves compressive sensing, encryption, and packet loss. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with security and cryptography, which suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as the second likely sub-category. The paper involves image processing and compression, which suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the third and fourth likely sub-categories.
