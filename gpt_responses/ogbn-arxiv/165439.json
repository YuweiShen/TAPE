Therefore, cs.PL (Programming Languages) is the most likely sub-category. The implementation involves data structures and algorithms for efficient storage and retrieval of ground terms, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the performance properties of the implementation, which is related to databases (cs.DB) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
