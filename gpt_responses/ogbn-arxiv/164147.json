The paper proposes new methods for maintaining a good approximation of the minimum Steiner tree spanning a changing set of terminals in sublinear time. This problem is closely related to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), game theory (cs.GT), and robotics (cs.RO). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
