This involves natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) techniques, which are commonly associated with the cs.CL and cs.IR sub-categories. The paper also discusses experimental graphs that help in understanding the overall course structure and provide a tool for localizing certain topics for indexing, which could fall under the cs.LG sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of video genres with recurrent thematic words, which could be relevant to the cs.MM sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on instructional videos suggests a potential application in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), which could fall under the cs.HC sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
