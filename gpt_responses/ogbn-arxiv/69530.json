Additionally, it could also belong to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category as it studies the ARM64 architecture and its suitability for data centers. The paper also involves Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) as it deals with the practical application of computing in reducing operational costs for data centers. The Database (cs.DB) sub-category is also relevant as the study involves benchmarking on Apache Hadoop. Finally, the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category could be relevant as the study involves machine learning benchmarks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
