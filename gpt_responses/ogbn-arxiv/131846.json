The use of probabilistic state-space models and Bayesian smoothing also suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves statistical modeling and estimation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of blob detection and tracking suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM).
