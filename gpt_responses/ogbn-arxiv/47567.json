The use of regression models for preserving the ordinal relation between grades is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) and the paper also discusses the issue of label confusions, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve analyzing a large dataset, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and the proposed method could also be applied to information retrieval tasks (cs.IR) in medical imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
