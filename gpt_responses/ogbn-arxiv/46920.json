This involves combining features extracted from both types of images and converting them into a dense feature map using kernel regression and density estimation. The output is a pixel-level labeling of the overhead image. This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and machine learning (ML) techniques such as kernel regression and density estimation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves ML techniques such as kernel regression and density estimation, which are used to convert features extracted from the ground-level images into a dense feature map. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nThe paper involves the use of AI techniques such as CNNs and ML techniques such as kernel regression and density estimation to estimate geospatial functions. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. \n\nThe paper involves the use of computer vision techniques to analyze geospatial data, which is related to the cs.GR (Graphics) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of computer vision techniques to analyze geospatial data, which is related to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
