The study of convexity properties is also relevant to optimization and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of coding under maximum-likelihood decoding suggests a possible connection to network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the analysis of the bit error rate as a function of noise power may also be relevant to data science and machine learning (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
