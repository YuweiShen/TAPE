The proposed algorithm also involves the use of network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system control (cs.SY) to estimate the channel gain. The paper also focuses on the performance of the system (cs.MM) and the communication protocols (cs.COM) in different propagation environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
