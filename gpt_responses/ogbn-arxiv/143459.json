Therefore, cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses methods from linear algebra and analysis, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper introduces a hierarchy of degrees for infinite words, which is similar to the recursion-theoretic degrees of unsolvability, indicating that it may also belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
