This problem involves matching two sequences in a geometric space and can be applied to various areas such as signal analysis and bioinformatics. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving geometric problems. The problem of computing GED involves matching two sequences in a geometric space, which is a typical computational geometry problem. \n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The paper presents an algorithm for computing GED, which is a typical problem in this sub-category. \n\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): This sub-category deals with the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous. The problem of computing GED involves matching two discrete sequences in a geometric space, which is a typical problem in this sub-category. \n\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the study of social and information networks and their properties. The problem of computing GED can be applied to various areas such as social network analysis and bioinformatics, which are typical areas in this sub-category"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
