The focus on decentralised execution and communication constraints suggests a potential fit for multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the proposed MAVEN approach involves a hybridisation of value and policy-based methods, which could also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
