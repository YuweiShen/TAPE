The use of edge detection and grid superimposition to extract features is a technique commonly used in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). The study also involves human-computer interaction, as the emotions are being detected from a group of participants watching sports events (cs.HC). The use of thresholds and accuracy measures is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
