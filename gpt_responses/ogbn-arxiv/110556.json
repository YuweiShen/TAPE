This involves exploring the relationship between samples and projecting input features into a new feature space. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on publicly available benchmark datasets and compares it with existing state-of-the-art kernel-based one-class classifiers. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, since the proposed method involves neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper deals with outlier detection, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) could also be a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
