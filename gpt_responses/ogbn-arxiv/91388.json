The paper proposes a new algorithm for admissible velocity propagation that enables path-velocity decomposition to discover truly dynamic motions. This makes the paper most likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also deals with system dynamics and constraints, which makes it relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper proposes a new algorithm, which involves computation and optimization, making it relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves sampling-based planners, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves some visualizations and demonstrations, which makes it relevant to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
