It also involves separation logics, which is a subfield of programming languages (cs.PL). The focus on heap-based data structures and concurrency suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of mathematical foundations and proof techniques suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
