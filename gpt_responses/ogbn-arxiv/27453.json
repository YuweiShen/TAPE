This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which suggests it could also belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and complexity theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions an open problem related to finding a maximum perimeter convex hull, which could place it in the categories of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
