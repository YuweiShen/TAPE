The controllers use model-predictive control (MPC) and inverse statics optimization to address the challenges of controlling these high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The paper focuses on the control aspects of the problem, rather than the design or fabrication of the robots themselves, suggesting that it is more likely to be categorized under robotics (cs.RO) or systems and control (cs.SY) than mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The use of optimization techniques and the focus on closed-loop control also suggest that it could be categorized under robotics and control (cs.ROB) or control engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
