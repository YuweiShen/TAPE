The paper also discusses the need to balance efficiency and privacy, which is a common concern in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The use of differentially private sanitizers and oblivious RAM also suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the need to hide the memory access pattern from the server, which is a common concern in the field of cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper presents a generic construction of differentially private outsourced databases, which involves machine learning techniques such as differential privacy (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
