The focus is on a scenario where the user's preference changes in a piecewise-stationary manner, which suggests a sub-category of machine learning dealing with non-stationary environments. The paper proposes efficient algorithms based on upper confidence bound and likelihood ratio test, which are common techniques in reinforcement learning and decision making. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also derives regret upper bounds and minimax lower bounds, which are common in information theory and optimization, suggesting cs.IT (Information Theory) as another possible sub-category. Lastly, the paper deals with a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, which is a well-known problem in optimization and decision making, suggesting cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
