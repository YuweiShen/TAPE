The paper also discusses optimizations for CDCL-based algorithms, which are related to logic and proof theory (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) as it discusses techniques for improving the efficiency of SAT solvers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
