The paper also discusses the behavior of gradient descent in over-parameterized ResNet, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper touches on the topic of neural network depth (cs.NE) and the global minimum of the loss function (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis to derive its results, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
