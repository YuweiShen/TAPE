The paper also presents a modeling framework that accounts for techno-economic interactions between the distribution and transmission electrical grids, which could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY) and control theory (cs.CY). The paper also discusses the optimization techniques used in the framework, which could be classified under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the communication networks used in IoT-controlled loads, which could be classified under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
