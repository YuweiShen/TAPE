This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained networks and fine-tuning, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve the use of large datasets, which is a common theme in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks for performance improvement, which is a common theme in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
