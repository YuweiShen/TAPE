The paper proposes a novel framework with randomized algorithms for better detection of correlated anomalies from large streaming data of various correlation strength. This work is likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it involves the development of a new framework for anomaly detection using randomized algorithms. It could also be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as anomaly detection is an important task in security applications like botnet detection. Additionally, it could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it involves the development of efficient algorithms for principal score calculation. It could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it involves the use of machine learning techniques for anomaly detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
