The paper proposes a novel transfer learning framework called BEETLE, which involves learning from old data to optimize new configurations. This involves building performance models, which is a task that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves identifying the most relevant source of old data, which is a task that involves program analysis and understanding (cs.PL). Finally, the paper deals with optimizing software systems, which is a task that falls under systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
