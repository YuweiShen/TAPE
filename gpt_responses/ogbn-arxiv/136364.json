The paper also discusses the advantages and limitations of the algorithm on different landscapes, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and optimization and control (cs.SE). Finally, the paper visualizes the search process as a connected graph, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
