The paper also introduces a new ensemble sparsity model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The analysis is based on a bipartite graph representation, which is a common tool in mathematics and computer science (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the joint recovery of multiple signals, which is a topic related to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
