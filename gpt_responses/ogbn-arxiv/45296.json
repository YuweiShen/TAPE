The paper also proposes a method for determining the fair bandwidth share for each connection, which involves computation and optimization (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions simulations and measurements of network performance, which are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the need for switches to constantly measure demand and available capacity, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
