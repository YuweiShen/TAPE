The paper also uses deep learning and neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also introduces a novel dataset, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in embedded biometrics systems, which could place it in cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
