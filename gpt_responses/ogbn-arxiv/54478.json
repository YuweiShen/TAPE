The use of non-abelian groups is a specific mathematical technique, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves algorithms and data structures for implementing the techniques, which could fall under distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves statistical analysis of the security of the protocols, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
