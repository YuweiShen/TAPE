Specifically, the authors propose a novel framework for interpretability in CADx using a generative adversarial network. This involves learning the relationship between malignancy and a standardized description (BI-RADS) through adversarial learning between a lesion generative network and an interpretable diagnosis network. This work falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the medical imaging aspect. Additionally, the use of adversarial learning involves a neural network architecture, which could also fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
