Additionally, the paper mentions the use of crowd sourcing, which is a common technique in NLP research. The paper may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category because Mention Detection is a key component of many IR systems. The use of state-of-the-art systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper's focus on benchmarking and evaluation suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of spoken data suggests that it may also belong to the Sound (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
