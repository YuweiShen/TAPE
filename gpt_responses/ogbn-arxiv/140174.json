The use of transformer-based architectures such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa suggests a focus on deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves experimentation with joint training of models on multiple datasets, which could fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
