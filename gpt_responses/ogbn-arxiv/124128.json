Additionally, the use of contextualized embeddings is a popular technique in NLP research. The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) because it proposes a joint model for sentiment analysis. The use of shared layers in the model may also be relevant to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because sentiment analysis is often used in search engines and recommendation systems. Finally, the use of transfer learning in the shared sentiment prediction layer may be relevant to the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
