This involves applying graph neural networks without edge-dependent filter generation, making it computationally attractive for large point clouds. The proposed method is demonstrated for point cloud classification and semantic segmentation using various datasets. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), graphics (cs.GR), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
