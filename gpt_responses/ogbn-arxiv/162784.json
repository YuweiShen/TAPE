The paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework to solve the resource slicing problem. The problem formulation involves optimization and scheduling, which are typical topics in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of DRL also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also deals with the coexistence of two services with different requirements, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques, which could be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
