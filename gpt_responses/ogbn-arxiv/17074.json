The paper discusses various methods for predicting the veracity of claims, including encoding evidence and modelling metadata. This work involves natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), machine learning (ML), and data analysis, which are all relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers NLP and related topics, such as text classification, information extraction, and sentiment analysis. The paper uses NLP techniques to process textual sources and extract features for veracity prediction.\n\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers IR and related topics, such as search engines, recommendation systems, and web mining. The paper collects data from fact checking websites and uses IR techniques to rank evidence pages and retrieve relevant information.\n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers ML and related topics, such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, and decision making. The paper uses ML techniques to train models for veracity prediction and evaluates their performance.\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers ML and related topics, such as deep learning, probabilistic models, and optimization. The paper uses various ML models and techniques, such as logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks, to predict the veracity of claims.\n\n"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
