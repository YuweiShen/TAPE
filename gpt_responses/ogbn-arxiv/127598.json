This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel surface-to-image representation and adapts successful CNN models to the surface setting, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper achieves state of the art results in semantic shape segmentation and shape retrieval, which involves neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
