It also conducts experiments on standard benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Other likely categories include cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the paper deals with neural networks, cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the experiments involve image classification tasks, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper proposes a new learning strategy, and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the paper discusses the use of knowledge transfer techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
