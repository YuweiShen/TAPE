The concept of \"code smells\" is borrowed from software development, which suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL). The use of a prototype called \"Smella\" implies a focus on software tools and systems (cs.SI). The evaluation of the approach in practical environments suggests a connection to cybernetics and systems (cs.CY). Finally, the use of machine learning for smell detection suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
