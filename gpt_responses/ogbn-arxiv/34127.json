This problem is closely related to the problem of minimum edge planarization, which involves removing a minimum-cardinality subset of edges from a graph to make it planar. Therefore, the paper is likely to be classified under computational geometry (cs.CG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), graph theory (cs.GT), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
