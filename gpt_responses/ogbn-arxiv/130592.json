The use of Stochastic Kernel-based Finite State Automata (SK-FSAs) and entropy-based policy search algorithms are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with control and decision-making in complex systems, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with multi-agent systems, which is a subfield of multi-agent reinforcement learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
