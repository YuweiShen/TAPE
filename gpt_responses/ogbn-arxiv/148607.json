The use of cloud-oriented systems of computer mathematics (SCM) and the SageMath Cloud specifically also suggests a focus on computer engineering (cs.CE). The paper also touches on the pedagogical and methodological aspects of teaching mathematics, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the mathematical software (cs.MS) sub-category, as it discusses the use of specific software for mathematics learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
