The paper also heavily relies on neural networks, which suggests that it could also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper explores different training strategies for the BERT model, which could fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper focuses on the Portuguese language, which suggests that it could also fall under the category of natural language processing for specific languages (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
