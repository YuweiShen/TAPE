The paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework for multi-oriented scene text detection, which involves semantic segmentation and region proposal based object detection. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves deep learning techniques and leverages multi-level features, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves text segmentation, which suggests that it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves benchmarking and evaluation of the proposed approach, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
