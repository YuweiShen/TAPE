This topic falls under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Distributed Systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm, which involves analyzing network usage and CPU-intensive authentication mechanisms, falling under the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper evaluates the algorithm in a cryptocurrency application, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
