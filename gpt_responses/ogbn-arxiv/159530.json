Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the vulnerability of gradient-masking defenses, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the proposed defense method involves the use of auxiliary blocks, which is related to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
