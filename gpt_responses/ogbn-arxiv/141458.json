The authors propose a new metric to measure the robustness of neural networks to adversarial samples, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses various attacks on neural networks, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the authors use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze the properties of adversarial samples, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
