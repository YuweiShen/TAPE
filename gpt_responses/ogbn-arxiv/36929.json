The proposed method uses evolutionary algorithms, which is a common technique in optimization problems and falls under the category of neural evolution (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of non-dominated sorting, which is a technique commonly used in multi-objective optimization problems and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
