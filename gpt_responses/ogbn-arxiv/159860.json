The use of nondeterministic bits also suggests a connection to the theory of computation (cs.TH) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the mention of limitations and achievable bounds may also relate to cryptography (cs.CR) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
