The paper also discusses the design of feedback laws, which is a key aspect of control systems (cs.SY). The use of optimization techniques and the mention of a linear quadratic regulator design suggest that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with stochastic systems and noise, which could fall under the category of statistics and data analysis (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
