This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The pipeline relies on RGB-D data for perception, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The approach also involves identifying manipulation primitives and reasoning about corrective actions, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the pipeline aims to achieve robustness, which involves control and system engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
