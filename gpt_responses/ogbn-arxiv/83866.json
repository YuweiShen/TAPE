This suggests that the paper may fall under the sound category. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes two methods using phonetic vectors and multi-task learning to improve speaker embedding extraction. This involves natural language processing techniques and may be categorized under computation and language. \n- cs.SD (Speech Recognition): The paper uses the x-vector architecture, which is commonly used in speech recognition tasks. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the speech recognition category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes new methods for speaker embedding extraction, which involves machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper may be categorized under machine learning. \n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with speech signals and introduces phonetic information to improve speaker embedding extraction. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the signal processing category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
