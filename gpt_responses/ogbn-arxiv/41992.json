The paper uses tools from stochastic geometry to investigate the impact of directional antenna arrays in mm-wave networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper also deals with the performance analysis of mm-wave ad hoc and cellular networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.COM (Computers and Society) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
