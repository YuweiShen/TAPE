This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a two-tiered network deployment, where cognitive small-cells coexist with macro-cells. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new precoder scheme to control the interference in a two-tiered network deployment. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper evaluates the achievable sum-rate of the small-cell network, which is a performance metric for multimedia applications. This falls under the domain of multimedia.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal with social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the deployment of wireless networks in society.
