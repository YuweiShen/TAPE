This falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO) and specifically, robotic manipulation and grasping. The paper also discusses the theoretical background and finite element analysis, which suggests a focus on mechanical engineering (cs.ME). Additionally, the paper deals with the design and development of a robotic gripper, which falls under the category of robotics and automation (cs.ROB). The paper also mentions the flexibility of the actuation mechanism, which suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of embedded sensing, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
