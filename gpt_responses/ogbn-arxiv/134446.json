Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the accuracy of image classification, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also proposes a strategy for constructing joint spaces of weights, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of fine-grained SGD for optimization suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with the norms of weights in DNNs, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
