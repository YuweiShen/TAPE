This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.DB (Databases): Minhashing is commonly used in databases for similarity search and clustering, making this sub-category a likely fit.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the properties of universal hash functions, which is a topic in discrete mathematics.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses a new iterative procedure to generate hash functions that improves the speed of minhashing.
