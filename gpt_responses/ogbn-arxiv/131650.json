This involves the use of a wide range of outlier detection algorithms, including established outlier ensembles and more recent neural network-based approaches. As such, the paper is likely to be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
