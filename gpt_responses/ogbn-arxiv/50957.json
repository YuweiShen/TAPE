Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper heavily relies on visual detection and tracking. The use of deep neural networks also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the cooperative aspect of the system could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
