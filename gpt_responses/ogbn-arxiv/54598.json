The paper also discusses the extension of the popular Gaussian noise model to account for the finite memory of realistic fiber channels, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper deals with the effects of nonlinearity and dispersion in the fiber-optic channel, which are topics related to optics and photonics (cs.OH, cs.PH). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of coding on the channel capacity, which is a topic related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
