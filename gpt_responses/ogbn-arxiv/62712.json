This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed approach in cognitive radio communication, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the special case of massive MIMO, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the outage probability of the system, which is a common metric in cognitive radio (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
