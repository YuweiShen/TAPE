The paper specifically focuses on the noisy adaptive setting, which involves designing tests based on previous outcomes, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and statistical inference (cs.ST). The paper also discusses computationally efficient algorithms, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
