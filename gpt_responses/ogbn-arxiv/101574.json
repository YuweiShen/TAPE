The paper proposes a system for robust SLAM that works in both static and dynamic environments, which involves optimization of large number of variables and incorporation of semantic constraints. This suggests that the paper could also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with obstacle tracking and avoidance, which falls under graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
