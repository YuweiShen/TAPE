The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised learning for group detection, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed frameworks on multiple public benchmarks, which is related to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
