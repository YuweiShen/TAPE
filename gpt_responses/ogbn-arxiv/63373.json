The use of the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is a key aspect of the paper, which is covered by the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel soft-thresholder based on MMSE denoising, which falls under the cs.MM sub-category. Finally, the numerical demonstrations on synthetic and practical datasets suggest the use of numerical analysis and optimization techniques, which are covered by the cs.NA sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
