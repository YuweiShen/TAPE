The focus is on distributed systems, which suggests that it could also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. The paper also discusses convergence properties, which suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The protocol discussed in the paper involves agents migrating between resources, which suggests that it could belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category.
