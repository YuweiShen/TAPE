The paper discusses the specifications required for such a device and proposes the use of multiple PCMO-RRAMs in parallel within a synapse. The paper also discusses the circuit-requirements for implementing such a scheme. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), as the paper deals with developing a synaptic model for SNNs using new technologies. The other likely sub-categories are cs.EM (Electromagnetism), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), and cs.CM (Computational Mathematics), as the paper also discusses the circuit-requirements and mathematical modeling of the proposed synaptic model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
