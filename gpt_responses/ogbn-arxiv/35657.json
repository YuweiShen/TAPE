This involves applying classification algorithms to the traffic and analyzing features such as packet inter-arrival time and size. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the categories of computer security (cs.CR), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
