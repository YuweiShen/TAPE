The paper proposes a new learning mechanism for NMT based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and also falls under the Computer Science category. The paper also mentions the use of sequence-level training, which is a technique commonly used in Deep Learning (DL) and falls under the Machine Learning (ML) subfield of Computer Science. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of rewards based on word-level BLEU and character-level chrF3, which are evaluation metrics commonly used in NLP and DL. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
