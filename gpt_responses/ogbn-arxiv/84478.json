This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the experiments and comparison of different methods could also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
