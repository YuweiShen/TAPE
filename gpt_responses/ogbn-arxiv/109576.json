It presents an efficient algorithm for computing ExactLine for networks that use ReLU, MaxPool, batch normalization, fully-connected, convolutional, and other layers. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, since the paper deals with neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper addresses the problem of computing a succinct representation for a linear restriction of a function, which has implications for security and cryptography, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
