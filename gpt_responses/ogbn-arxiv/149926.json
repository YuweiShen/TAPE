It falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words, which is a typical problem in ML and AI. Hence, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on authorship verification, which is a problem in information retrieval (IR) and cybersecurity (CR). Therefore, it could also belong to cs.IR and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
