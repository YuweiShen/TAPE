The splitting model is a specific type of coding scheme, which is often studied in the coding theory (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also involves the construction of optimal codes, which can be seen as an algorithmic or computational problem, making the paper relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
