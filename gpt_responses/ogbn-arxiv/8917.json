It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a novel attention mechanism to improve the performance of neural abstractive summarization. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the use of machine learning techniques to improve the quality of summarization. It could also be classified under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a key task in information retrieval. Finally, it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it involves the use of neural networks to improve the performance of summarization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
