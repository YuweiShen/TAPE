The paper also discusses the performance of these models on different datasets, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of neural networks is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of visual information in some NLI benchmarks, which could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
