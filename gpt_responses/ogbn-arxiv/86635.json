It could also be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it deals with the optimization of neural networks. Additionally, the paper's focus on activation functions and their impact on network performance suggests it could be classified under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of tasks and performance evaluation suggests it could also be categorized under Computer Vision (cs.CV) or Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
