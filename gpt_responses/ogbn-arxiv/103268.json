The paper also involves the study of bounds on list size, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of bounds and analysis of code properties also suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of rank-metric codes in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
