It proposes a framework to predict the future literature-based discoveries by examining the relationships between knowledge entities using Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN) and Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network. The paper also uses data from two multidisciplinary research domains other than the medical domain. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DL (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
