This involves addressing privacy concerns and multi-jurisdictional laws and policies of cross-border genomic data sharing. The paper proposes a hybrid solution using homomorphic encryption and Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) to ensure high efficiency and privacy. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses privacy concerns and proposes a secure framework using encryption techniques.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with accessing and analyzing genomic data from multiple sources, which involves database management.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the ethical and legal issues related to cross-border genomic data sharing and proposes a solution to address them.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of statistical analysis of genomic data, which involves machine learning techniques.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with federated genomic datasets, which involves distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
