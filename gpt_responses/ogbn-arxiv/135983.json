Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves machine learning and optimization, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The use of non-invasive markers involves computer vision techniques, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category.
