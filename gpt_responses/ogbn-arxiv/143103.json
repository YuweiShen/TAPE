The paper also discusses constraints on rate pairs and symbol pairs, which are related to coding theory (cs.CC). The use of Taylor series expansions to derive moderate deviations constants suggests a connection to statistical inference (cs.SI). The consideration of blockwise and symbolwise settings may also relate to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the use of information spectrum-type strong converse suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
