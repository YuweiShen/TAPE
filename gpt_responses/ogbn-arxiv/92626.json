Additionally, the paper proposes a new process framework that involves the use of machine learning, which could also place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also discusses the use of psychometric measurement instruments, which could suggest that it belongs to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) category.
