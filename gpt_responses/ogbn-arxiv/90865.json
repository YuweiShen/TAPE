The use of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Statechart modeling for anomaly detection also suggests a security focus. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with modeling network traffic patterns in ICS, specifically between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses unsupervised learning algorithms to automatically construct the Statechart model from a captured traffic stream. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new modeling approach for ICS traffic patterns, which could be relevant to software engineering practices in the development of ICS. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with Industrial Control Systems, which are systems that involve the control and automation of physical processes. The use of Statechart modeling for anomaly detection also suggests a systems and control focus."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
