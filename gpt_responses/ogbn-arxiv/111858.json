The proposed scheme uses analog beamformers to mitigate co-channel multi-data-stream interference and exploit the extra spatial degrees of freedom induced by the geographic distributed SBSs for data multiplexing. Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and sum-rate are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a distributed hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) scheme for small cell systems. The proposed scheme aims to improve the system sum-rate by exploiting the extra spatial degrees of freedom induced by the geographic distributed SBSs for data multiplexing. The paper also discusses the impact of the proposed scheme on the network architecture and the design of the access and backhaul links. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme aims to improve the system sum-rate by exploiting the extra spatial degrees of freedom induced by the geographic distributed SBSs for data multiplexing. This can be particularly useful for multimedia applications that require high data rates and low latency. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a distributed hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) scheme for small"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
