It also discusses the challenges faced by researchers in designing fake profile detection systems using machine learning techniques. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the security and privacy threats posed by fake profiles in online social networks and the need for intelligent automated detection systems to identify and alleviate them in real-time. It also highlights the existing cyber laws to mitigate their threats. \n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the social implications of fake profiles in online social networks and their impact on users' lives. It also discusses the need for reinforcing security and privacy laws to curtail cybercrime. \n4. cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on the study of different categories of fake profiles like compromised profiles, cloned profiles, and online bots on different online social network sites. It also discusses the features that can distinguish fake entities from real ones. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the machine learning techniques employed to design different fake profile detection systems. It also provides data collection techniques and existing data sources to address the challenge of unavailability of data specific to fake users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
