It also involves the analysis of algorithms and complexity (cs.CC), as well as the use of statistical methods (cs.SI). The proof technique used in the paper may also be relevant to the study of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may be of interest to researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG) due to the use of polar codes in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
