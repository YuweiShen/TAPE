The proposed framework involves synthesising visual features for unseen classes, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of semantic attributes as an intermediate clue also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the benchmark datasets used in the experiments involve images and videos, indicating a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
