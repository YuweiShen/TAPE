This involves dividing model parameters into fixed and adaptive parts and developing a two-stage meta learning algorithm to learn them separately. This approach is more efficient and storage cheaper than previous methods and has potential to deal with catastrophic forgetting while continually adapting for streaming coming users. The paper involves machine learning, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and social and information networks, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computational Linguistics), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
