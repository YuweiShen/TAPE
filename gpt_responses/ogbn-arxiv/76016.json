The presence of byzantine faults, which are a type of malicious fault, makes this problem more challenging and brings it closer to the distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS) fields. The use of GPS devices and communication between robots also involves topics related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the problem of determining trajectories for the robots can be seen as a planning and optimization problem, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
