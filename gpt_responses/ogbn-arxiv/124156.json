It also discusses training scalability, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a new operator for distributed training suggests a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on improving computation efficiency and reducing model size suggests a potential fit for the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
