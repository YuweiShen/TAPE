It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a method to reduce parameter redundancy in biaffine classifiers, which is a machine learning model. Additionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with improving the performance of a model using a novel approach. It could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as biaffine classifiers have been used in image classification tasks. Finally, it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as biaffine classifiers are a type of neural network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
