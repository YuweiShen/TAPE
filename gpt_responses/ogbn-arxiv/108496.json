This suggests that the paper could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms category.\n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The generalized Bruhat decomposition is closely related to the geometry of flag varieties, which are objects studied in computational geometry. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computational Geometry category.\n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper presents an algorithm for computing the inverse matrix, which is a problem in numerical analysis. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Numerical Analysis category.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that the algorithm is suitable for parallel computer systems, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing category.\n5. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The generalized Bruhat decomposition is a problem in algebraic geometry and representation theory, which are areas of research that often involve symbolic computation.
