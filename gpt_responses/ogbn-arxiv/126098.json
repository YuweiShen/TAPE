This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AL). The use of uninitialized memory suggests a focus on efficient memory management, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The optimization of access time could also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
