It also involves the use of machine learning algorithms to extract features from power traces, which is a common technique in the field of side-channel attacks. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it discusses a new approach to software testing, specifically for embedded devices. The paper proposes a threefold process that involves sending input to a target device, extracting features from power traces, and calculating a score for the input. This process is aimed at identifying faulty states in the program, which is a key aspect of software testing. \n\ncs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible category as the paper deals with embedded devices, which are a type of system. The paper proposes a new approach to testing these devices, which involves measuring power consumption and using machine learning algorithms to extract features. This approach could be useful in the field of control systems, where embedded devices are commonly used. \n\ncs.AR (Architecture) is also a possible category as the paper discusses the code structure of the analyzed firmware. The authors use the extracted features to reconstruct the code structure, which is a key aspect of software architecture. \n\nFinally, cs.PL (Programming Languages) is a possible category as the paper discusses the behavior of input-processing software.
