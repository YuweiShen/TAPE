The paper also discusses partial observation and communication delay, which are topics in the fields of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The use of local controllers and preemptors is a technique commonly used in the field of robotics (cs.RO), which is also relevant to this paper. Finally, the paper employs timed relative coobservability, which is a technique used in the field of machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
