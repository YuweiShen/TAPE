This problem is related to social choice theory, which falls under the category of computational game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses randomized mechanisms, which are commonly used in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, falling under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's application to peer review and funding decisions suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
