Robotics plays a key role in such facilities, and the paper evaluates wireless communication technologies that can be used to enable communication between different modules and robots. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on evaluating different wireless communication technologies that can be used in modular production facilities. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the requirements for modular production facilities and how wireless communication technologies can be used to meet those requirements. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of modular production facilities and how wireless communication technologies can be used to enable communication between different modules and robots. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Although less likely, this category could be relevant as the paper discusses the evaluation of different wireless communication technologies and their suitability for use in modular production facilities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
