This involves utilizing a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to generate the primitive driving patterns, which are then clustered and labeled using behavioral semantics. The paper also discusses individual driving styles and evaluates the difference in driving styles among drivers using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
