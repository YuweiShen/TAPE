The specific types of data being generalized are geographic and geometric, which suggests categories such as computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses approximation algorithms, which are a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
