This topic falls under the broad category of distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of erasure codes also involves information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses fault-tolerance and error handling, which are relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
