This work involves aspects of social media, commerce, and entertainment sites, which are typically studied in the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Social and Information Networks (cs.SOC), and Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER). The proposed framework also involves machine learning techniques, which are studied in the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper focuses on evaluating the properties of RSs, which is a key aspect of the sub-category of Social and Information Systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
