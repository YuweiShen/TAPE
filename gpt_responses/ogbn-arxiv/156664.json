It also introduces a new variational bound to efficiently train with Boltzmann machine priors. The experiments are conducted on several benchmarks related to computer vision and natural language processing, indicating that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
