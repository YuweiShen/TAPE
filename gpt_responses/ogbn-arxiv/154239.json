However, the main approach involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn customized object detectors, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a new model for learning customized object detectors from scratch, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on standard datasets, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) aspects. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.RO, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
