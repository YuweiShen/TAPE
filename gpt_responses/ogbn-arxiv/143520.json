The paper also proposes a new learning technique for better controlling style strength, which involves regression learning and loss functions, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses stability in the style transfer process, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
