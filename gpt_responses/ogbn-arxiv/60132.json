The use of neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also mentioned. Additionally, the paper explores the behavior of these algorithms for non-convex problems, which relates to optimization (cs.NE) and the theoretical analysis of algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
