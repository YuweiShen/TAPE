The approach involves using human demonstrations captured from different camera perspectives, which requires computer vision (cs.CV) techniques such as feature disentanglement. The use of labeled human demonstrations and model-based imitation learning also involves machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the approach aims to enable cost-effective data collection and effective navigation, which relates to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
