The use of high-resolution analysis for quantizer design suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The investigation of the energy-distortion performance under additive white Gaussian noise indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the optimization of the energy-distortion dispersion suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
