The paper also proposes a new algorithm that involves using the base classifiers as features and inputting them into an SVM classifier, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the performance of SVM as the dimension of features increases, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
