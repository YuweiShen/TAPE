This requires computer vision techniques and knowledge of image processing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes adapting the Transformer neural machine translation architecture to a multimodal setting. This involves training a machine learning model to perform the translation task. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper deals with developing an AI system for multimodal machine translation. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with multimodal machine translation, which involves processing multiple modalities such as text and images. This falls under the domain of multimedia processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
