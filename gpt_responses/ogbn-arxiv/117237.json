Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a meta learning based method, which involves training a model to learn how to learn, making it likely to fall under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with video surveillance applications, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
