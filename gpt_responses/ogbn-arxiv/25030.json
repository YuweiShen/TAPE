The paper also proposes two methods for biasing the output length with a transformer architecture, which involves deep learning techniques and falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's experiments involve training and testing the proposed methods on NMT datasets, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the application fields of NMT, such as document translation and subtitling, which involve computer vision techniques and fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
