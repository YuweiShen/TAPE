This falls under the domain of information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme can be used in wireless communication systems, which is a part of networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new MIMO transmission scheme that combines SM and spatial multiplexing. This involves designing a system that can control the transmission of multiple symbols simultaneously. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme can be used to improve the transmission of multimedia data, such as video and audio, by increasing the spectral efficiency. \n\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): This paper does not directly relate to the social or ethical implications of computing, but it may indirectly impact society by improving the efficiency of wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
