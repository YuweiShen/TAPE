This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the study of information processing, transmission, and storage. The paper also applies random matrix theory to derive the regularizer, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category, which deals with the study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The paper also involves numerical simulations, which suggests that it could belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category, which deals with the study of algorithms for solving mathematical problems numerically. The paper also deals with signal estimation, which suggests that it could belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category, which deals with the study of techniques for processing and analyzing signals. Finally, the paper deals with the estimation problem, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category, which deals with the study of systems and control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
