The paper also discusses the use of causal inference to detect and repair bias, which is a topic in the subfield of causal inference (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of social datasets, which suggests a potential connection to the subfield of social computing (cs.CR). The paper also deals with the use of algorithms to detect and repair bias, which is a topic in the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
