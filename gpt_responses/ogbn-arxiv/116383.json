The paper also discusses the different types of DL models used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which could fall under the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of DL models for forecasting in specific financial markets, such as index, forex, and commodity forecasting, which could fall under the sub-category of Computational Economics (cs.CE) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
