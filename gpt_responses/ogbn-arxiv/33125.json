The focus is on planar graphs, which suggests computational geometry (cs.CG) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between space and query time, which is a common theme in algorithmic graph theory (cs.DM). The use of distance oracles for real-world road networks suggests a possible connection to network science (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes improvements to existing algorithms, which could fall under the sub-category of algorithm design and analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
