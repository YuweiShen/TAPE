This falls under the domain of distributed computing and cloud computing, making cs.DC the most likely category.\n2. cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing): The paper discusses the implementation of stateful services in a distributed environment, which falls under the domain of distributed computing. Hence, cs.Distributed is also a likely category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the control plane of AWS Lambda and proposes a way to exploit it. This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY a likely category.\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the management interfaces of cloud providers and proposes a new service model. This falls under the domain of software engineering, making cs.SE a likely category.\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the consistency model for AWS Lambda, which falls under the domain of programming languages. Hence, cs.PL is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
