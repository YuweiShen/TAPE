Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a pseudo-center loss to decrease the variance between the samples and the corresponding pseudo center point, which involves optimization techniques and can be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of pseudo-classes and pseudo-labels can also be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with remote sensing scene representation, which can be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
