The use of polynomial approximation is a common technique in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and the paper proposes a fixed data structure that can be used to answer all queries of interest. The paper also discusses the accuracy of the private mechanisms, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with databases and the release of information from them, which is a topic in databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
