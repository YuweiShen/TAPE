The paper focuses on the use of Incremental Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient and effective adaptation to changes within data streams. These techniques are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
