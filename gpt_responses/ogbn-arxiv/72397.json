It involves selecting a subset of training data points with their corresponding learning rates to minimize the upper-bound on the estimation error of the full gradient. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS). The paper also includes experiments on logistic regression and training neural networks, which are applications of machine learning in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the method is applicable to non-convex (deep) functions, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
