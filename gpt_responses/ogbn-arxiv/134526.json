This suggests a strong connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HCI), as well as software engineering (cs.SE) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) for analyzing the argumentative process. Additionally, the paper may also relate to cybernetics (cs.CY) due to its emphasis on the dynamics of viewpoints confrontation/integration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
