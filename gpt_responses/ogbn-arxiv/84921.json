The method proposed in the paper leverages human knowledge in the form of annotated video libraries, which involves large-scale search and retrieval of videos, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The proposed method also involves adapting retrieved object locations to the new video using an efficient warping scheme, which can be seen as a form of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
