This involves modeling complex interactions and cooperation with nearby decision-making agents, such as pedestrians and other robots. The paper proposes an algorithm that learns collision avoidance among a variety of types of non-communicating, dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular behavior rules. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
