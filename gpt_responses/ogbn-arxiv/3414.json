The use of deep neural networks also falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper specifically deals with handwritten character recognition, which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of information retrieval techniques to improve classification accuracy, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
