The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on the CUB-2011 dataset, which is a commonly used dataset for fine-grained classification in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques such as ensemble learning, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning models and neural networks, which are common in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also mentions the evaluation of the proposed approach on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, which is a remote sensing image dataset. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of image retrieval techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
