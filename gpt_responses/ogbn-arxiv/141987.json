The method is based on moving least squares (MLS) approximation, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the efficiency and scalability of the method, which are important considerations in information visualization (cs.SI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
