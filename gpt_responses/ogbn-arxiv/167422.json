The paper involves the study of ballistic hopping dynamics and its motion planning on an asteroid surface with highly nonlinear gravity fields. The paper also presents methods for localization of the hopping robot using pose estimation by successive scan matching with a 3D laser scanner. The study is then extended to find optimal trajectories to reach a desired goal by visiting multiple waypoints. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
