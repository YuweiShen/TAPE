This suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the statistical analysis of these algorithms, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of learning theory, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category.
