This falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also introduces a new kernel-based approach for estimation, which involves regularization and nonparametric methods. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
