The paper also discusses the impact of fading on the secrecy capacity, which is a topic in wireless networking (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a low-complexity power allocation strategy, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) if the focus is on optimizing video or audio transmission over wireless channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
