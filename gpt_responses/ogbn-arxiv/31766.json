The paper proposes a new approach to solve this problem by formulating it as a polynomial size asymmetric linear system. This approach involves techniques from graph theory, linear algebra, and computational complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
