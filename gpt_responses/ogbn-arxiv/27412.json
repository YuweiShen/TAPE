This suggests a potential connection to the field of electromagnetism.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a new hardware design for generating non-uniform sampling clocks, which falls under the category of hardware architecture.\n- cs.CM (Computational Mathematics): The paper mentions compressive sensing, which is a mathematical framework for efficient signal acquisition and processing. This suggests a potential connection to the field of computational mathematics.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, compressive sensing is often used in machine learning applications, and the proposed clock generator could potentially be used in such applications as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
