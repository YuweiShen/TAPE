The criterion is designed to be permissive to many chosen strategies, minimally engaging, and skill-sensitive, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the use of the criterion for creating a shared control scheme for training or assistance, which suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of simulation to test the criterion, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
