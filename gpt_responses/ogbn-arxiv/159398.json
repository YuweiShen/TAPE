This involves indexing academic authors through a graph-based profiling technique that models their expertise using Wikipedia entities mentioned in their publications. The paper also discusses the use of the system for indexing and profiling the research community within the University of Pisa, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Additionally, the use of entity linking and semantic relatedness measures in the system aligns with natural language processing (cs.CL) and deep learning (cs.DL) research areas. Finally, the use of latent vector representations derived from Wikipedia aligns with research in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
