The paper proposes a new approach using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is a popular machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning pipelines and efficient deployment, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of RNNs also involves dealing with sequential data, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
