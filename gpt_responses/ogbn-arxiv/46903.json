The method aims to reduce the number of operations and off-chip memory accesses required for real-time inference, which is a common challenge in neural network hardware implementations (NE). The paper also discusses the experiments conducted with fully-connected deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, which are common architectures used in CV and LG. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of weight distribution normalization and gradual pruning techniques, which are relevant to the areas of computer architecture (AR) and control systems (SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
