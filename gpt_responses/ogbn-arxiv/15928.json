The paper also discusses the use of Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv codes, which are commonly used in source coding and compression, suggesting that the paper may also be relevant to the arXiv categories of cs.SI (Sound and Image Processing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
