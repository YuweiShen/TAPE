The paper also discusses the use of policy gradient algorithms, which falls under machine learning (LG). Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of mutual adaptation in non-stationary domains, which relates to systems and control (SY). Finally, the paper proposes a curriculum-based strategy for learning interactive policies, which is a technique commonly used in multi-agent systems (MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
