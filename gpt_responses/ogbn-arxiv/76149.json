The specific task of counting weakly labeled concepts is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of advanced convolutional artificial neural networks is also mentioned, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the discussion of decision making systems and autonomous cars suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
