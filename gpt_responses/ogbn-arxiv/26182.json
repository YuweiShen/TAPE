The paper proposes a new full reference quality index for evaluating the perceived quality of the reconstructed background image, which combines color and structural information at multiple scales. This work is likely to be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image reconstruction and quality assessment. It may also be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves video surveillance and object tracking. Information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant as the paper discusses the use of probability summation models. Artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR) may also be relevant as the paper discusses the development of algorithms for image processing and quality assessment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
