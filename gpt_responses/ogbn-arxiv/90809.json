It also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) as it uses SNMP-MIB interface parameters to detect anomalies. The paper uses machine learning algorithms (cs.AI) and attribute evaluators (cs.LG) to achieve accurate results. Finally, it can be considered as a system and information theory (cs.SI) paper as it proposes an efficient detection model to increase the performance and efficiency of intrusion detection systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
