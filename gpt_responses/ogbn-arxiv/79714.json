It also discusses the use of dynamical systems and computation for control, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the potential for machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) in optimizing the morphology of robot bodies. Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of developing models for different morphologies, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
