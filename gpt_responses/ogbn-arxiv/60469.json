The study also examines the impact of Airbnb on the housing structure, which can be considered as an information network of housing supply and demand. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the implications of Airbnb's disruption of the housing structure in London, which is a social issue related to the use of technology and the sharing economy. The study also provides insights into the relationship between the diversity of dwelling types and the distribution of Airbnb listings, which can inform policies associated with the sharing economy. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses entropy as a measure of diversity and correlation analysis to examine the relationship between the diversity of dwelling types and the distribution of Airbnb listings. These methods can be considered as computational tools for analyzing complex systems. \n- cs.SD (Software Development and Programming): Although the paper does not focus on software development or programming, it does use data from Airbnb's platform to analyze the spatial distribution of listings in London. The study also discusses the potential of using such data to inform policies related to the sharing economy. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This paper does not focus on cryptography or security, but it does touch"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
