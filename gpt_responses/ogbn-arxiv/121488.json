The paper also discusses the theoretical embedding of technology within the theories on subjective energy, which could be classified under the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper reviews the empirical literature on the relationship between ICT use and subjective energy concepts, which could be classified under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the negative effects of ICT use on users' energy, especially in organizational contexts, which could be classified under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper provides a conceptual baseline for future research on the relationship between ICT use and subjective energy of ICT users, which could be classified under the sub-category of computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
