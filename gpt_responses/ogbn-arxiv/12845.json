The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised learning and regularization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes new training mechanisms to improve the smoothness of the predicted deformations, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) or information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
