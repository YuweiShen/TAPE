Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the security benefits and vulnerabilities of different routing policies, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper uses theoretical and experimental approaches to study the topic, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper provides prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
