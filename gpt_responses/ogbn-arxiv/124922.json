The use of machine learning techniques for prediction also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on discovering predictable \"bottleneck\" frames suggests a connection to structured prediction (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
