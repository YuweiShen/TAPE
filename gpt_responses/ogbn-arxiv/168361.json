It also uses a Vector-Space model and a feed-forward neural network, which are commonly used in computational linguistics research. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it uses a neural network for learning. \n\nAdditionally, the paper could be categorized under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with the implicit learning of semantic regularities, which is a common topic in AI research. \n\nThe sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is also a possibility as the paper uses a neural network for learning. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC) is a less likely possibility as the paper does not focus on complexity theory, but it does use computational methods to study language learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
