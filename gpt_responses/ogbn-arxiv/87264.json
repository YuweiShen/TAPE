It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses the design of efficient network structures, which is a core content of neural network research. Additionally, it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it proposes a new network architecture. It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it discusses the theoretical characterization of network structure on performance. Finally, it may belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it uses techniques in complex networks to extend ResNet."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
