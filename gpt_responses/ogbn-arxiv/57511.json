The use of neural representations for matching suggests that the paper is likely to fall under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The optimization of a local linear model for color transfer suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and learning theory (cs.LG). The spatially-variant and globally coherent color transfer also suggests that the paper may be relevant to graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the use of a coarse-to-fine strategy and the extension from \"one-to-one\" to \"one-to-many\" color transfers suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
