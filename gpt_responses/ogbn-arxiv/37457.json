It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as hand pose estimation is important for robotic manipulation tasks. The use of deep learning suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves the use of synthetic hand models for training the networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
