The use of a teleoperator's hand as an input device suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect. The proposed algorithm for mapping between different hand pose spaces involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve pick and place tasks, which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
