These sensors rely on electromagnetic principles, making cs.EM a likely category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on the design and analysis of a drone flight controller, which falls under the domain of robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the importance of timing guarantees in cyber-physical systems, which is a key aspect of systems and control. \n- cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper mentions the use of the Quest RTOS for implementing the flight controller, making cs.OS a possible category. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the development of a composable pipe model for analyzing the end-to-end timing properties of the flight controller, which involves the use of programming language constructs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
