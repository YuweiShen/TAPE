This involves injecting problem knowledge in policy gradient updates. The paper also conducts experiments across a variety of standard benchmark environments and shows that the proposed framework improves performance for on-and off-policy methods. The paper also investigates how the approach addresses the problem of reward sparsity and pushes the function approximations into a better-constrained parameter configuration. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
