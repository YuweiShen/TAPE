The use of neural networks for value function representation suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The focus on exploration and coordination suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) sub-categories. The use of randomized value function learning and the consideration of practical scale problems suggest that the paper may belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. Finally, the use of coordinated exploration in a concurrent setting suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
