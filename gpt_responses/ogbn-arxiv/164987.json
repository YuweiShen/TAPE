This is a classic problem in computer vision and hence, this category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of image database segregation on the web, which is a multimedia platform. Hence, this category is also likely to be a good fit for this paper.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach to address the problem of selfie detection using a CNN. This involves learning a synergy feature in the common subspace of head and shoulder orientation, which is captured by projecting the LBP and HOG features using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). This is a machine learning problem and hence, this category is also likely to be a good fit for this paper.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of categorisation of a huge amount of data on the multimedia platform, which involves retrieval of relevant information. Hence, this category is also likely to be a good fit for this paper.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although this category is less likely to be a good fit for this paper,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
