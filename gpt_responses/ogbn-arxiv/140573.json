This falls under the category of formal languages (cs.FL) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the Parikh vectors of the factors of binary words, which relates to information theory (cs.IT) and combinatorics (cs.DM). The proof that the language of prefix normal words is not context-free and is strictly contained in the language of pre-necklaces suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
