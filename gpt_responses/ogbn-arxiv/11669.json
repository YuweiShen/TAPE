The paper also involves statistical modeling and analysis of wireless propagation channels, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) is a communication technique, which falls under the category of communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the cancellation scheme, which is related to system design and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the performance gains of SIC in multi-tier heterogeneous networks, which is related to multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
