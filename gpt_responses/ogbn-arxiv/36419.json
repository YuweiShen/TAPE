The use of proof nets and the Yoneda isomorphism suggests a connection to proof theory (cs.PL) and category theory (cs.CC). The paper also involves the manipulation of structures and the definition of an equivalence relation, which are common themes in discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
