It also involves network communication and transfer protocols (cs.NI), operating systems (cs.OS), and system design and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes improvements for scheduling algorithms in a distributed system, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
