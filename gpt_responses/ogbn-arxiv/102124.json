The paper also uses the Lasserre (Sum of Squares) system, which is a mathematical optimization technique commonly used in theoretical computer science, and thus the paper could also be categorized under computational complexity (cs.CC). The problem involves augmenting a tree, which is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, and thus the paper could also be categorized under computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper involves approximation algorithms, which is a topic in graph theory, and thus the paper could also be categorized under graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves analyzing fractional solutions, which is a topic in optimization and linear programming, and thus the paper could also be categorized under optimization and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
