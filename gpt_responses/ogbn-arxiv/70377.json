The kernelization results suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and parameterized complexity (cs.CC), as these are areas that often deal with kernelization and parameterized algorithms. Finally, the problem of finding induced cycles may also be related to graph theory (cs.GT), which is a broad category that encompasses many sub-areas of graph theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
