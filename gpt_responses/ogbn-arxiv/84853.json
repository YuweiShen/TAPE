The paper also discusses series expansions and asymptotic behavior, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and dynamical systems (cs.DS). The study of Hidden Markov Processes is also relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
