The paper also discusses the construction and properties of codes, which are relevant to the Coding Theory (cs.CR) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new explicit construction of batch codes, which are used in private information retrieval and load-balancing, making the paper relevant to the Security and Privacy (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
