The paper focuses on the technical aspects of the design, including frequency-shifting backscatter transmissions and decoupling carrier generation. These technical aspects suggest that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.RO (Robotics and Automation). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of smartphones and sensor nodes as infrastructure, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Finally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of a specific technology suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
