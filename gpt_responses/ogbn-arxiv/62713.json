It also involves modelling the mapping between observations and interaction classes, which can be seen as a natural language processing (NLP) problem (cs.CL). The use of probabilistic multi-label classification and learning from crowdsourced annotations suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach. Finally, the use of video sequences and annotations on verbs suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) aspect to the work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
