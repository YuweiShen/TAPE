This topic falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of these methods in finance and engineering, which could fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
