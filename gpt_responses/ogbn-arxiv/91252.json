The proposed method involves learning a low-rank representation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of collaborative representation-based classification (CRC), which is a method commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT).
