The authors propose a generative model that learns the kinematics, feature structure, and camera parameters simultaneously, which involves machine learning (cs.CV, cs.LG). The model also allows for matching target locations of features in significantly fewer steps than state-of-the-art visual servoing methods, which involves optimization and control (cs.AI, cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
