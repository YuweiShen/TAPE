The use of selective convolutional layer activations to form a discriminative descriptor for video also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the mapping of body joints into convolutional feature maps, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a two-stream bilinear model suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques in the paper could also place it in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
