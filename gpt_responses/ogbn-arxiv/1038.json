The methodology presented involves learning a plannable latent representation, which involves the use of autoencoding networks and dynamics networks, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses a visual planning problem, which involves planning in the visual (pixel) space, and thus falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) and RRT-based algorithms also involves the use of search and optimization techniques, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
