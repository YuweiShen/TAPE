This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses several pruning techniques based on the check node decoder and variable node decoder update equations, significantly reducing the size (i.e., decoding complexity) of the parity-check matrix. This falls under the domain of computational complexity. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The proposed decoder is shown to benefit from reduced memory requirements compared to Ar{\\i}kan's original BP decoder, making it more suitable for hardware implementations. This falls under the domain of social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a novel approach to interpret polar codes as LDPC-like codes with an underlying sparse decoding graph, which requires the development of new algorithms and data structures. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed decoder is shown to benefit from reduced complexity, making it more suitable for hardware implementations. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
