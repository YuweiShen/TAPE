The paper also discusses the use of optimization techniques such as Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural Networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper deals with the issue of outliers, which is a topic that falls under the category of Data Science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses real-world datasets, which is a common practice in Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
