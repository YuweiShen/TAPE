The problem formulation involves minimizing expected mean-squared distortion, which is a common objective in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the behavior of the system under attack, which is a common topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of Gaussian distributions and mean-squared error suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
