The paper discusses the sum rate maximization problem for the secondary system subject to per-antenna power constraints and interference power constraints at the primary users. This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves designing a precoder to maximize the sum rate while satisfying constraints."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
