The paper also proposes a new architecture design and optimization techniques, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of binary weights and activations is also related to neural networks (cs.NE) and the optimization of hardware for efficient inference is related to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
