This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including cryptography (cs.CR), software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), logic (cs.LO), and systems and control (cs.SY). However, given the focus on security and the case study on web authorization protocols, cs.CR and cs.SE are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
