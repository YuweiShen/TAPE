The paper also discusses the vulnerability of classifiers to these attacks, which is related to the security and privacy of the system (cs.CR). The proposed defense mechanism involves regularization techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which involve data analysis and statistical methods, falling under the category of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
