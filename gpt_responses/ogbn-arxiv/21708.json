The use of game-theoretic approach and the formulation of a coalitional game model suggest that the paper also belongs to the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The mention of wireless sensor networks and the need to allocate source coding rates to a large number of sources suggest that the paper may also belong to the mobile and wireless computing (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of computational complexity reduction suggests that the paper may also belong to the signal and image processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
