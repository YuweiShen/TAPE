The paper also discusses the implementation of a threshold-tunable step function, which is a common concept in neural network applications (cs.NE). The numerical micromagnetic simulation results and the design of a majority logic gate also suggest that the paper could be categorized under simulation and modeling (cs.SD) and electromagnetics (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
