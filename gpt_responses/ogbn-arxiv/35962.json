The use of beamforming and multiple antennas also suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes the use of minimum mean square error (MMSE) framework, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
