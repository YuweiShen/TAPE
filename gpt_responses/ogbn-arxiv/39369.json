The paper proposes a new feature representation and metric learning method for this task, which is a common problem in computer vision.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Person re-identification is a task that is often encountered in multimedia applications, such as surveillance videos. The proposed method could be useful in such applications, which makes cs.MM a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a new metric learning method, which is a subfield of machine learning. The proposed method uses cross-view quadratic discriminant analysis to learn a discriminant low dimensional subspace and a QDA metric on the derived subspace.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - Person re-identification can be seen as a type of information retrieval task, where the goal is to retrieve images of a specific person from a large database of images. The proposed method could be useful in such applications, which makes cs.IR a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - While less likely than the other categories, person re-identification is also relevant in security applications, such as identifying suspects in a criminal investigation. The proposed method could be useful in such applications, which makes cs.CR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
