The paper also discusses the use of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, which are popular topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper uses the AffectNet dataset, which is a multimedia dataset, indicating a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of facial emotion recognition in human-computer interaction (cs.HC), suggesting another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
