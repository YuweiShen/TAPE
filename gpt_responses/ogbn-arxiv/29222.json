This falls under the categories of information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The focus on image compression also suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR) as possible categories. Finally, the consideration of digital VLSI implementation suggests signal processing (cs.SI) as another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
