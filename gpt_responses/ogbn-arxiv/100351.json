The use of maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions reduced ordered binary decision diagrams, which are commonly used in computer science theory and algorithms (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
