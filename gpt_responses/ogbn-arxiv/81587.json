The extension of the results to multiple-input single-output fading channels suggests that it may also be relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The mention of spectral distribution function and Gaussian process suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
