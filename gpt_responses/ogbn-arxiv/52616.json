This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The use of perfect channel state information suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY). The analysis of diversity and coding gains is related to network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the use of multiple antennas and spatial modulation may also be relevant to the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
