The method is evaluated on competitive tasks such as image classification and sentiment analysis, which are typically studied in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. The paper also mentions the use of back propagation, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the interpretability of the learned label embedding, which is a topic of interest in explainable AI (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
