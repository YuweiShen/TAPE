The paper proposes a model to deal with the heterogeneity of attributes across knowledge graphs, which involves embedding and comparing entities, and hence it is likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The paper also proposes a joint framework to merge the alignments inferred from attributes and structures, which involves learning from data, and hence it is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Learning) category. The paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are a form of structured data, and hence it is likely to belong to the cs.DB (Databases) category. Finally, the paper deals with entity alignment, which is a form of information retrieval, and hence it is likely to belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
