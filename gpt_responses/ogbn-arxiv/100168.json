The paper also introduces a new notion of typicality that can be applied to countably infinite alphabets, which is related to the study of discrete structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the asymptotic equipartition property, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper presents a new version of the Markov lemma, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and has applications in machine learning (cs.LG) and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
