The method is evaluated on RGBD sequences of real objects, which suggests that it falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) categories. The use of deep learning also suggests that it may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the evaluation of the method on challenging datasets of real-world capture suggests that it may also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
