This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the reduction of parameters required for processing, which is related to optimization (cs.NE) and efficiency (cs.CL) in machine learning. Finally, the paper uses convolutional neural networks, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
