The paper also discusses the regularization effect of additive noise on the arguments of multi-step functions, which is related to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed algorithm on image classification benchmarks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a novel training algorithm for quantized neural networks, which is related to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper provides explicit bounds on the Lipschitz constant, which is a concept from information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
