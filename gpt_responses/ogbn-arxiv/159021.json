The paper proposes an alternating minimization algorithm for learning both the dictionary elements and the mixing coefficients. This algorithm is a popular heuristic for sparse coding and has been extensively studied in the literature. The paper establishes local linear convergence for this algorithm and establishes that the basin of attraction for the global optimum is $\\order{1/s^2}$, where $s$ is the sparsity level in each sample and the dictionary satisfies RIP. These results are of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), computer vision (cs.CV), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
