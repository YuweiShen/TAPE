The focus on benchmark problems and rescaling results suggests a focus on algorithms for optimization problems, which could fall under categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the mention of maximum clique problems suggests a focus on graph algorithms, which could also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
