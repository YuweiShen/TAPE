The authors propose the use of data mining techniques (cs.IR) to automatically select the most relevant indexes for a given workload. They also mention the computational cost of these operations, which is a topic related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the proposed solution involves the use of cost models (cs.AI) to evaluate the performance of different index configurations. Finally, the authors mention the use of frequent itemset mining (cs.LG) as a specific data mining technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
