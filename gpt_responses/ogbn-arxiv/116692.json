The paper proposes a new approach that uses a search strategy to adaptively direct computational resources to sub-regions likely to contain objects, which involves the use of neural networks (cs.AI) and machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The approach also involves zooming in on sub-regions, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper mentions that the code is publicly available, which suggests that it may be of interest to the machine learning community (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
