Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another likely category. The use of CNNs for channel estimation also suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible category. The paper involves statistical analysis and optimization, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible category. Finally, the paper deals with mmWave systems, which suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
