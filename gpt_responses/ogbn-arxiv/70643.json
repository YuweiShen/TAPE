The method involves incorporating a non-parametric regularizer based on an empirical entropy estimator. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories related to machine learning, such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also uses simulated and real data sets, which suggests that it could belong to sub-categories related to computer vision (cs.CV) and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
