The paper also discusses multi-user communication, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.SI). The concept of fidelity criteria is related to signal processing and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses interconnection perspectives, which is a topic in network infrastructure (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical proofs and derivations, which is a common feature of papers in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
