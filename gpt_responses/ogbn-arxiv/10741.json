The proposed method also involves analyzing the impact of different training methods and network architectures on interpretability, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper uses natural language processing techniques to label hidden units with semantic concepts, which could be relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
