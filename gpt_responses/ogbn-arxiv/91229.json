The use of deep neural networks (DNN) and unsupervised word representations also suggests that the paper could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The study of robustness to adversarial attacks could also be relevant to cybersecurity (cs.CR) and potentially even cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
