This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design and performance analysis of a cooperative protocol for wireless sensor networks, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on the security aspects of wireless sensor networks, and proposes a new protocol to ensure secure multicasting. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of analog beamforming for sectoral transmission of messages in wireless sensor networks, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a cooperative protocol for wireless sensor networks, which involves distributed beamforming and control of relay nodes.
