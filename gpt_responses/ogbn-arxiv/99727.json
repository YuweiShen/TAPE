It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) category as depth estimation is an important task in robotics. The use of deep convolutional networks for unsupervised learning suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the paper's focus on edge-awareness and local planar smoothness suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
