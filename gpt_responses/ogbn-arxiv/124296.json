The approach involves using probability maps and planning algorithms, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using simulations and dealing with occlusion, which are common topics in computer vision (cs.CV). The use of probability maps and planning algorithms also falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions outperforming baseline methods, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
