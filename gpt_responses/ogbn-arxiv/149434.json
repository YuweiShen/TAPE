The paper specifically focuses on the explanation extraction method for black-box ML models, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The user-study conducted in the paper also relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The high-risk domains mentioned in the abstract, such as health-care and defense, suggest that the paper may also be relevant to cybersecurity (cs.CY) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
