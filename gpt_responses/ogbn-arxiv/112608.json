The paper also uses information theory (cs.IT) to develop a non-asymptotic approach for characterizing privacy. Additionally, the paper proposes privacy metrics and a design problem that can be formulated as a convex program, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper compares its framework with differential privacy, which is a popular approach to privacy preservation in computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
