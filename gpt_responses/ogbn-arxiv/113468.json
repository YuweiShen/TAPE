The use of support sets and geometric proximity for determining centrality and relevance is related to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), which makes cs.LG and cs.AI also likely categories. Finally, the paper's focus on producing language- and domain-independent summaries suggests that it could also be relevant to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
