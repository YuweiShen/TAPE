The paper focuses on the computation of outer bounds for multi-source multi-sink networks, which is a problem in network information flow. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
