This work is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with symbol detection in digital receivers. The integration of deep neural networks into the Viterbi algorithm suggests that the paper is also related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The proposed approach is designed to track dynamic channel conditions, which suggests that the paper is related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of meta-learning to train ViterbiNet suggests that the paper is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
