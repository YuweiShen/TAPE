The use of relays and training in the network suggests that it may also fall under the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses optimal signaling structures and achievability strategies, which could fall under the signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories.
