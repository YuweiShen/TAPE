It also involves properties of subcodes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of computer-aided classification suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the investigation of properties of the classified codes could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
