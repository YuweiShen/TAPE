This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). The construction of strongly regular graphs involves combinatorial designs and graph theory, which could be classified under discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of Galois rings and Hensel lifting involves algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry, which could be classified under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and number theory (math.NT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
