The paper also proposes practical methods to improve the calibration of the estimated uncertainties, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of safety in autonomous driving, which could be relevant to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
