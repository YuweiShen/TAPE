The authors propose a novel mechanism for multiagent coordination, which falls under the category of multiagent systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the empirical question of how humans arrive at expectations for coordination, which is relevant to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
