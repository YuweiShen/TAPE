Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of automatic metrics, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with creating a large corpus, which could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
