The paper also discusses the use of ARM multicore chips, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of operating systems (cs.OS) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper discusses the design of a realistic rover platform, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed framework, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
