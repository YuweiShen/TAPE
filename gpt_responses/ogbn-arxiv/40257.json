The method is based on Generalized Motion Pattern (GMP) and handles inter-scanner variability efficiently. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques for medical image analysis, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
