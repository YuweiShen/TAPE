This is relevant to information theory, which studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves the construction of a minimal spanning tree (MST) over the multivariate samples, which is a fundamental data structure in computer science. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new estimator for dependency between multivariate random variables, which is relevant to various AI applications such as causal inference and decision making. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper establishes asymptotic convergence of the estimator and convergence rates of the bias and variance for smooth multivariate density functions belonging to a Holder class, which is relevant to statistical theory and inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
