It also involves cryptography and security, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. Information Theory (cs.IT) is also relevant due to the use of message-adversaries. The paper also involves algorithms and data structures, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category.
