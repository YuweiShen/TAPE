This involves the use of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and the replacement of non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with Izhikevich-like neurons. These modifications are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
