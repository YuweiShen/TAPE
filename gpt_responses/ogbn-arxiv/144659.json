This algorithmic improvement is applicable to many different types of data and is shown to increase computational efficiency by about two orders of magnitude in high-dimensional problems, while retaining predictive performance. The paper also discusses the theoretical guarantees of the proposed algorithm in distributions that can be represented by Bayesian networks or maximal ancestral graphs. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), social and information networks (cs.SI), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
