This topic is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including social networks (cs.SOC), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the use of multiple sources of information (online and offline) and the proposed framework for community detection based on broad learning techniques suggest that this paper may also fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
