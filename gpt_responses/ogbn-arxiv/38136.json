The use of perfect matchings on a bipartite graph is also a common technique in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the performance of a broadcast channel with cache-aided and cache-less users, which is a relevant problem in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The use of caching in networks is a topic of interest in social and information networks. The paper also discusses the role of multiple antennas in removing penalties associated with cache-size unevenness, which is relevant to network design. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The use of perfect matchings on a bipartite graph is a common algorithmic technique, which is relevant to data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper does not explicitly discuss machine learning, but the use of caching and multiple antennas in improving network performance can be seen as a form of optimization, which is a topic of interest in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
