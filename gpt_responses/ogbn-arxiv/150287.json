Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the paper deals with assessing the security level of IoT applications. Additionally, cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are also possible categories, as the paper discusses the deployment of applications in heterogeneous infrastructures.
