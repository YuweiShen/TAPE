However, the focus on Jupyter notebooks suggests a stronger connection to specific sub-fields. The use of Jupyter notebooks is common in computational engineering (cs.CE) and data management (cs.DB) research, where reproducibility is particularly important. The paper also touches on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) aspects, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) where reproducibility is becoming increasingly important."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
