Therefore, cs.ET (Electronic Design Automation) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also extensively discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as table-based interpolation, Generalized Moving Least-Squares, and feed-forward Deep Neural Networks, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the potential of machine learning to automate the development of compact models, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the performance of the developed models using SPICE-like circuit simulations, which falls under the category of modeling and simulation (cs.MS). Finally, the paper discusses the validation of the developed models using laboratory measurements, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
