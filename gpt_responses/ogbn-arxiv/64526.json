It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as Evolution Strategies are a type of optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning. The investigation of Markov chains suggests that it could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The study of the influence of the cumulation parameter could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the investigation of the step size variation and divergence could also place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
