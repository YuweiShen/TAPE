The proposed method involves a transformation of the input event data that allows for learning-based tasks such as classification without the need for extensive data augmentation. This work is likely to be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities, as well as the robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
