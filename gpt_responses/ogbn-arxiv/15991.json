This technique is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The paper also discusses the use of total variation (TV) minimization, which is a popular method in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.NI). Finally, the paper mentions the potential applications of this method in mobile broadcast (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
