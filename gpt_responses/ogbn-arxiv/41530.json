The paper focuses on the vulnerability of neural network-based policies to adversarial examples, which is a common problem in the field of machine learning. The proposed defense mechanism leverages an action-conditioned frame prediction module to detect the presence of adversarial examples. The paper evaluates the performance of the algorithm using five games in Atari 2600. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
