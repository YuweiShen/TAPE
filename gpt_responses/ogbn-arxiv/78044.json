This work involves both cryptography and machine learning, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) the most likely category. Additionally, the paper proposes novel masked components for fully-connected layers and activation functions, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the security of the proposed design, which falls under the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). The use of FPGA boards for experiments suggests the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the problem of extending side-channel analysis to Machine Learning Model extraction, which falls under the category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
