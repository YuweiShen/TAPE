This falls under the domain of programming languages and is the most likely category.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the practical advantages of the proposed reversible calculus for communication-centric distributed software. This suggests a connection to distributed computing.\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions the definition of a session type discipline for the proposed reversible calculus, which involves logical reasoning about the behavior of concurrent systems. This suggests a connection to logic in computer science.\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the static verification of safe composition in communication-centric distributed software performing reversible computations, which is a software engineering concern.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the ability to undo previously executed interactions could have implications for security and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
