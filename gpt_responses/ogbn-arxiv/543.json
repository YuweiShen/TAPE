The paper deals with Visual Question Answering (VQA), which involves the integration of feature maps with different structures and focuses. This is a problem that is commonly addressed in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) research. The paper proposes a novel approach called Question Type-guided Attention (QTA) to improve VQA performance, which involves the use of machine learning models (cs.AI) and optimization techniques (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of multi-task learning to predict question types, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
