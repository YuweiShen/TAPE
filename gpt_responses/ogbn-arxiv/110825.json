It may also belong to the Security and Privacy (cs.SI) sub-category as it addresses concerns such as scalability of state management. Additionally, it could be classified under Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) as it proposes a new mechanism for multicast switching. The paper also touches on aspects of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it discusses the limitations of existing switching strategies. Finally, it could be classified under Architecture (cs.AR) as it proposes a new approach to implementing multicast switching in next-generation networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
