The paper also proposes a new data structure called DB-tree that realizes an overlay index to support a wide range of custom aggregate range queries as well as Authenticated Data Structures (ADSes), efficiently. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new data structure called DB-tree that realizes an overlay index to support a wide range of custom aggregate range queries as well as Authenticated Data Structures (ADSes), efficiently. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the need for storing Authenticated Data Structures (ADS) and proposes a solution to support it efficiently. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that all DB-trees operations can be performed by executing a small number of queries to the DBMS, that can be issued in parallel in one or two query rounds. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper proposes a new data structure called DB-tree that realizes an overlay index to support a wide range of custom aggregate range queries as well as Authenticated Data Structures (ADSes), efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
