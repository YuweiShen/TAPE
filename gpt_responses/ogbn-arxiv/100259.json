The use of automata and semantic interpretations also suggests a possible connection to formal methods (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the application of the theory to a capability system suggests a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
