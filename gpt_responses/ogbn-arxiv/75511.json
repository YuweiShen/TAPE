This task is commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) communities. The proposed model uses attention-based encoder-decoder structures, which are commonly used in both of these communities. Additionally, the model incorporates high-order cross-modal attention, which involves capturing the frame-level cross-modal interaction of different modalities. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) communities, which often deal with similar problems of modeling complex interactions between different types of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
