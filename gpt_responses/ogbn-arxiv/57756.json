The proposed approach involves the use of convolutional neural networks, which is a popular technique in the field of machine learning. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new dataset for benchmarking, which falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of recognition in the wild, which involves dealing with real-world scenarios and uncontrolled environments, making it relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
