It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as camera relocalization is an important task in robotics. The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks to learn features, which makes it likely to belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves 3D coordinate regression and pose estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
