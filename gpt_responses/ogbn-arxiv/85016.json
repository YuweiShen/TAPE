The use of multiple modalities (RGB and Thermal) and the proposed approach of multi-task manifold ranking with cross-modality consistency suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). The optimization algorithm and the use of graph-based manifold ranking also suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
