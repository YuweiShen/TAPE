The use of stationary strategies and the lack of stochastic assumptions suggest that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of competing strategies and the construction of an algorithm suggest that the paper may also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
