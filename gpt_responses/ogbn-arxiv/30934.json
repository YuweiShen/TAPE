Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves deep learning techniques such as bidirectional LSTM and Siamese net, which are commonly used in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper deals with image embeddings, which falls under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper involves text classification, which is a common task in cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
