The use of a deep and wide multi-scale recursive network is a common technique in computer vision applications. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nThe use of a learning framework and the focus on improving existing techniques suggests that this paper could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on learning features directly from the data suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on electron microscopy data and the use of image segmentation techniques suggests that it could belong to the scientific computing (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
