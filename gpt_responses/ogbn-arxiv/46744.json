It also involves the concept of thickness, which is a measure of the planarity of a graph and is related to graph theory (cs.GT) and combinatorics (cs.DM). The techniques used to draw graphs on multiple layers with low bend complexity involve algorithmic and data structure aspects (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the application of these techniques to improve the aesthetics of graph drawings, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
