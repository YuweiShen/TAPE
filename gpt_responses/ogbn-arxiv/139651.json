The paper proposes a method to estimate Long Range Dependence (LRD) in sequential datasets and applies it to language modeling and sequential recommendation tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also discusses the use of LRD in information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational complexity (cs.CC), which makes these sub-categories less likely but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
