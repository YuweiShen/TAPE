The use of Error Control Coding (ECC) and critical distance for energy efficiency also involves information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of different encoders and coding gains, which relates to cryptography and security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
