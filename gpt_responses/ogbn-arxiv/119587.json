The method involves training an embedded knowledge graph using end-to-end backpropagation, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of knowledge graphs, which are a type of database (cs.DB), and the approach involves predicting links between entities, which is a task related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
