Information theory is relevant in designing efficient communication systems.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a new scheme for uplink control channels, which is a key component of communication systems. The proposed scheme enables flexible non-contiguous resource allocation in frequency and offers improved performance compared to existing sequences.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new scheme for uplink control channels, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture as it improves the reliability and efficiency of communication systems.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new scheme for uplink control channels, which involves designing a set of complementary sequences with low cross-correlation. This is relevant to systems and control as it involves designing a system with desired properties.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme enables coherent detection at the receiver side, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require reliable and efficient communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
