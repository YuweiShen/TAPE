This topic falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also applies the method to image classification tasks (cs.CV) and uses genetic programming techniques (cs.NE) to build loss functions hierarchically. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for loss-function optimization to contribute to AutoML (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
