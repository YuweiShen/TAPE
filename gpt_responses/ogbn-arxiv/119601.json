This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.NI sub-category.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with adaptive bitrate streaming for video users, which is a multimedia-related topic. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.MM sub-category.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper proposes a cooperative streaming system that enables nearby mobile video users to crowdsource their cellular links and resources. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.SI sub-category.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper uses a Lyapunov-based online algorithm for mechanism design, which is related to information theory. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.IT sub-category.\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a low complexity Lyapunov-based online algorithm that can be implemented in an online and distributed manner. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.DC sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
