The paper also proposes a principled algorithm for filtering and smoothing in nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems, which is a common problem in these areas. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.ST (Statistics) are all likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
