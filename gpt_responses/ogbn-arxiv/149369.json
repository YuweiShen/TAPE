This involves computer vision techniques such as marker detection and pose estimation. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper involves the use of instrumented tools for reconstructing the bone surface and guiding the surgeon during the medical procedure. This involves robotics and control techniques. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper involves the use of video for guiding the drilling of the tunnel. This involves multimedia techniques such as video processing and analysis. \n4. cs.MS (Medical Imaging) - The paper involves the use of a pre-operative image of the patient's anatomy for aligning with a set of contours reconstructed by touching the bone surface with an instrumented tool. This involves medical imaging techniques such as image registration. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics) - The paper involves the reconstruction of contours on the bone surface using instrumented tools. This involves graphics techniques such as surface reconstruction and visualization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
