The use of sketching techniques and sampling with limited independence suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the focus on edge deletions may also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of streaming algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
