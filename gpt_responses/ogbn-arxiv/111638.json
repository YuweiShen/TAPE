This constraint is used to improve the spatial sparsity of the reconstructed images.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper employs tensor dictionary learning (TDL) to exploit the similarity of spectral CT images. TDL is a machine learning technique used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the reconstruction of medical images using spectral CT, which is a multimedia application.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper uses the alternative direction minimization method (ADMM) to solve the proposed method. ADMM is a numerical optimization technique commonly used in computer science and engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
