The paper also extensively evaluates the trajectory tracking performance of state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the importance of latency reduction in visual estimation module, which could involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper suggests directions for future improvements, which could involve artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
