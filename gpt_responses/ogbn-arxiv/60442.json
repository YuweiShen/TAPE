The use of RetinaNet, a popular object detection algorithm, also suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The practical applications mentioned in the abstract, such as autonomous cars and robotics, suggest that the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the mention of security cameras suggests that the paper may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
