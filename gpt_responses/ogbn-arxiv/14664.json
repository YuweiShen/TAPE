Additionally, the paper focuses on the classification of emotional expressions, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of support vector classification and dynamic time-warping similarity measures also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper's emphasis on recognizing expressions quickly suggests a possible connection to neuroscience and cognitive science (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
