The paper also discusses the different sampling methods used in active learning, such as membership-query, pool-based, and stream-based sampling, which are all relevant to the field of machine learning. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, which is a common concern in the field of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
