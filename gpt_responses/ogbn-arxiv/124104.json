The problem is solved efficiently using a new variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The paper focuses on the practical applications of SCO and analyzes the theoretical guarantee of model accuracy for two specific tasks: ridge regression and convex clustering. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
