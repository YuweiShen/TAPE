The paper discusses the label complexity of active learning in this setting and provides an algorithm for it. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also involves theoretical analysis, which suggests the possibility of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) being a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses empirical results, which could make cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
