The focus on cost-sensitive classification suggests that it may fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The extension of the minimax lower bound also suggests that it may fall under the sub-categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
