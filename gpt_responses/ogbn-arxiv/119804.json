This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel NOMA system with FD base stations based on C-RAN, which involves networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses power allocation policies for the proposed scheme, which involves system control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions the enhancement in connectivity provided by NOMA, which is relevant to multimedia applications.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography and security, but the combination of FD and NOMA may have implications for security in wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
