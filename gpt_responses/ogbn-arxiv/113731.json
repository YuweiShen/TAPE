The use of Layerwise Relevance Propagation and the inclusion of normalization layers suggest a focus on deep learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for fusing normalization layers and convolutional or fully connected layers, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed method, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
