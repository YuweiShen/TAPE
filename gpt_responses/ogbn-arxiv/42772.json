The paper proposes an end-to-end deep convolution network for joint learning of face hallucination and recognition, which involves optimization of parameters using loss functions. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of intra-class distance and classification error for verification loss, which indicates that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper uses deep models for generating discriminative feature representations, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves evaluation of performance on datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
