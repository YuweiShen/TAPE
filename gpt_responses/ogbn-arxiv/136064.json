The fields studied are not specified, but the paper focuses on US authors. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), as these fields are closely related to bibliometrics and research evaluation. Additionally, cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are also possible categories, as they are both computing-related fields that may involve conference papers and journal articles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
