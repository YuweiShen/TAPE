This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of acoustic emission events and spectral analysis suggests a potential overlap with computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the goal of predictive maintenance and the potential impact on future SHM technologies suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
