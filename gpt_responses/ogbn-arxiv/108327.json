The paper proposes a method to trade off bias and variance in any order score function estimators, which is a key component in many reinforcement learning algorithms. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
