The paper also focuses on wireless communication networks and signal processing algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SP), and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges and future directions of wideband spectrum sensing, which could fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
