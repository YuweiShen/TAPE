The paper also discusses the use of trusted hardware, which is a common technique in computer security (cs.CR). The use of semi-oblivious computing and the trade-off between privacy and performance are also relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results that involve machine learning techniques, which could be relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
