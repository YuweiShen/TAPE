This involves addressing the challenges of task assignment in MCS, which requires access to context information and learning context-specific worker performance. The paper also discusses the need to preserve worker context locally and keep the number of required quality assessments low. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
