The use of finite impulse response systems and wireless multipath channels suggests that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the comparison of the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art noncoherent schemes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
