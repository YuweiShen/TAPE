The paper proposes a new model for unmixing hyperspectral images that accounts for endmember variability, which is an important factor in accurately identifying the pure materials and their distribution in the image. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and signal processing (cs.SI). However, given the focus on image analysis and unmixing, cs.CV and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.LG, cs.MM, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
