The paper proposes a new network architecture designed to perform non-maximum suppression (NMS), which is a post-processing step in object detection. This involves training a neural network to merge all detections that belong to the same object, based on their scores and bounding boxes. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) and robotics (cs.RO) as well, as these fields often use object detection for various applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
