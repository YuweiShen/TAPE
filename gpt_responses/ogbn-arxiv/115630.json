This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Spectral clustering is a popular machine learning technique, and the paper proposes a method for making it more scalable. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with nearest-neighbor graphs, which are commonly used in social and information networks. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves computing the eigenvectors of graph Laplacians, which is a numerical analysis problem. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for reducing the complexity of graphs, which can be useful in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
