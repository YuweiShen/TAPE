Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the study of the Lasserre hierarchy relaxation, which is a technique used in optimization and can be related to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper uses matrix diagonalization techniques, which can be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
