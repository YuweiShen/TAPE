The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation and adversarial training, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of different types of corruptions on model performance, which could be considered under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new data augmentation policy, which could be considered under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
