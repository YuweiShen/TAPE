This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach for learning hierarchical skills in reinforcement learning. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses raw pixel data to discover objects and learn skills. This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes an algorithm for learning skills that can control interactions with objects in the physical world. This falls under the domain of robotics.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm for learning hierarchical skills that can control interactions with objects in the physical world. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
