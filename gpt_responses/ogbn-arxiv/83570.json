This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a mutual angular regularizer (MAR) and applies it to two popular LVMs - restricted Boltzmann machine and distance metric learning - which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
