The paper also mentions the use of a variant of the Hierarchical Artifact System (HAS) model, which is a formal language used to specify workflows, indicating a connection to programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses optimizations to the Karp-Miller algorithm, which is a classic algorithm used in formal verification, indicating a connection to logic (cs.LO) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a symbolic representation approach, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
