The approach is tested on several data sets, including computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), which suggests that these sub-categories are also relevant. Additionally, the paper mentions previous work on coupled priors, which is a technique commonly used in statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
