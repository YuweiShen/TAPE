This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n2. cs.LG - The proposed framework utilizes an actor-critic model, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which is a popular deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.RO - The paper proposes a new concept of using distributed vehicle autonomy to ensure separation, instead of a centralized sector air traffic controller. This falls under the domain of robotics. \n4. cs.SY - The proposed framework involves multiple agents interacting with each other in a dynamic environment. This falls under the domain of control systems and systems engineering. \n5. cs.CR - The paper addresses the problem of conflict resolution in a high-density airspace, which is a critical issue in aviation safety. This falls under the domain of computer security and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
