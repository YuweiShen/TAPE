The proposed method also involves multi-scale feature extraction and channel attention mechanism, which are techniques commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The use of deep learning models for denoising also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
