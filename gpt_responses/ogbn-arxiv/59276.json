This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes algorithms that exploit the inherent structure of the throughput, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
