The use of linear-shift deterministic Y-channel and Gaussian Y-channel also suggests that the paper may belong to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of network coding and capacity achieving schemes may also suggest that the paper belongs to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. However, since the focus of the paper is on wireless networks, we consider cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as the least likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
