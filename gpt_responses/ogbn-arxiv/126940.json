The paper also discusses the limitations of existing backdoor attacks and proposes a new approach using universal adversarial triggers, which involves adversarial attacks (cs.CR) and potentially natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of benchmark datasets, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for improving backdoor attacks, which could involve artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
