The focus is on polyadic constacyclic codes, which are a type of cyclic code (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the Gray images of polyadic negacyclic codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper mentions self-dual, isodual, self-orthogonal, and complementary dual codes, which are topics in algebraic coding theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses \\(\\alpha \\)-constacyclic codes, which are a generalization of cyclic codes (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
