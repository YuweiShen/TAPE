Additionally, the use of computer graphics to generate virtual worlds suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also discusses tracking, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of deep learning algorithms suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
