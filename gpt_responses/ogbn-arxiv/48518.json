Therefore, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the potential throughput gains brought by EHT, which is related to information theory. Therefore, cs.IT is also a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions the digitalisation of everything, which includes multimedia content. Therefore, cs.MM is a possible sub-category.\n\n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper describes the main candidate features and enhancements of EHT, which may involve hardware architecture. Therefore, cs.AR is a possible sub-category.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper covers important aspects such as the coexistence with other wireless technologies, which may involve system and control. Therefore, cs.SY is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
