Additionally, the paper evaluates the accuracy, time, and confidence of user interactions, which could fall under the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of a camera gimbal and the evaluation of visual interactions could also place this paper in the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The development of kineme systems and the prescription for further development could be considered Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
