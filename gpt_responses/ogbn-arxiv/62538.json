The use of random matrix theory also suggests a potential fit for the statistical theory (cs.ST) sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of system and channel characteristics, which could be relevant to the communication (cs.COMM) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
