It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as these fields are closely related to computer vision. Additionally, the paper proposes a new architecture to improve the MobileNet, which involves optimizing the computational cost and accuracy, indicating that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses experimental results on CIFAR database, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
