This involves detecting the presence of primary user signals in the licensed spectrum. Information theory is closely related to this problem, as it deals with the fundamental limits of communication and signal processing. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning based signal detector, which exploits the underlying structural information of the modulated signals. This involves training a neural network to learn the features of the signals, which is a classic machine learning problem. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a neural network for signal detection, which falls under the domain of neural computing. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a cooperative detection system, which involves multiple nodes working together to detect the presence of primary user signals. This falls under the domain of systems and control, as it involves designing a distributed system to achieve a common goal. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses deep learning techniques for signal detection, which is a classic application of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
