This makes it easier to focus on the behavioural challenges of reinforcement learning. The paper discusses the use of DQN and online actor-critic with eligibility traces to evaluate the MinAtar environments. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions the use of a binary state representation, which suggests a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE suggests a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
