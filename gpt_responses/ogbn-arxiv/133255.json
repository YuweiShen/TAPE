The use of Q-Learning algorithm for power allocation suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the study. The paper also discusses the design of a complete MAC protocol, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the implementation of the algorithms using GNURadio and USRP platforms suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG) in the study."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
