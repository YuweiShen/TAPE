This involves designing a state, action, and reward formulation for the RL problem, and training a coordinated policy using a model-accelerated PPO algorithm. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method that uses reinforcement learning to optimize the coordination of multiple vehicles at intersections. This falls under the scope of AI research. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with the coordination of automated vehicles, which is a topic within the field of robotics. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a machine learning algorithm (PPO) to train a coordinated policy for the vehicles. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of multiple vehicles at intersections, which falls under the scope of systems and control research. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper deals with the coordination of multiple agents (vehicles) at intersections, which is a topic within the field of multiagent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
