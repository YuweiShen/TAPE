The codes are also potentially useful in cryptography (cs.CR) and secret sharing schemes (cs.DM). The paper involves algebraic manipulation and computation, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper may have applications in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
