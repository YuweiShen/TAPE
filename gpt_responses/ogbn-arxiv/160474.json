This involves lifting sequential code to a high-level summary expressed in a program specification language, which is then compiled for execution on Hadoop. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper describes a compiler that automatically retargets sequential Java code for execution on Hadoop, which involves lifting sequential code to a high-level summary expressed in a program specification language. This involves techniques related to programming languages. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on leveraging parallel data processing frameworks, specifically Hadoop, to execute sequential code in a parallel manner. This involves techniques related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper describes a tool, Casper, that automatically translates Java benchmarks into Hadoop. This involves techniques related to software engineering, such as program analysis, transformation, and optimization. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper focuses on Hadoop, a parallel data processing framework that implements the MapReduce paradigm. This involves techniques related to databases, such as data storage, retrieval, and processing. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
