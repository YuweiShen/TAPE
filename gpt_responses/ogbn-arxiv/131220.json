The paper also discusses the impact of delay and stochastic encoding on the capacity of the channel, which are relevant topics in networking (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper introduces novel code constructions and jamming strategies, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
