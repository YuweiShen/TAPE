This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses rules governing implementation from the model, which suggests that it may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the benefits of the resulting spreadsheet, such as being easier to understand, audit, and maintain, which suggests that it may belong to the Databases (cs.DB) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also belong to the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category, as developing error-free spreadsheets is important for ensuring the security of sensitive data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
