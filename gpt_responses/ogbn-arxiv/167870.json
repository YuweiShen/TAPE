This is a common problem in social and information networks where the graphs can be very large and complex. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a novel pooling mechanism as a component of a graph convolutional neural network, which falls under the scope of neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
