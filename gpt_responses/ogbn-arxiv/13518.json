The paper also discusses the advantages of using neural networks for feature extraction, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of non-local features, which is a topic of interest in neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV).
