The study also involves evaluating the link performance and channel estimation, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The use of mm-wave communication and OFDM modulation also relates to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
