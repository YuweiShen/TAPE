However, given that the proposed approach involves designing self-explaining neural networks, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of neural networks for image classification tasks (as mentioned in the abstract) suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) could also be a relevant sub-category. The paper also mentions regularization techniques for enforcing faithfulness and stability, which are topics that are relevant to the sub-fields of natural language processing (cs.CL) and cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
