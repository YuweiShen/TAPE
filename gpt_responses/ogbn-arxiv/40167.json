The use of citations and discourse structure is common in natural language processing and information retrieval, which suggests that cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques such as word embeddings and supervised learning suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on biomedical and computational linguistics datasets suggests that cs.DL (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
