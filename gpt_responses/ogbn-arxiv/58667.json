The use of Hamming distance and probabilistic protocols suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The study of streaming algorithms and lower bounds on space complexity points towards data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). Finally, the use of logarithmic precision and bounds on Hamming ball size suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
