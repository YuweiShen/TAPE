Additionally, it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a regularization method to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as self-attention networks have been used in image processing tasks. Furthermore, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a method to improve the performance of neural networks. Lastly, it could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with neural networks and proposes a method to prevent co-adaptation of feature vectors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
