The experiments involve both synthetic and real data, which suggests a focus on data science (cs.DS). The use of a quantum annealer also falls under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET) and neural networks (cs.NE) due to the potential for quantum computing to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
