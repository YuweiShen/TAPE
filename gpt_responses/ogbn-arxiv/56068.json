This is a typical problem in the field of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of labeled set filters, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications. The proposed algorithm involves optimization and information divergence, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
