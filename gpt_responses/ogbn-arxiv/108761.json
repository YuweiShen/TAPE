This falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of local synaptic plasticity rules, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for these models to be used in brain-inspired hardware, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
