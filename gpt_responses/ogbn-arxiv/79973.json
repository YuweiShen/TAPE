This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10, and Pascal VOC2012, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions using the ScreenerNet for a Cart-pole task using Deep Q-learning, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
