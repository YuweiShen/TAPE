The paper also discusses adversarial attacks and proposes a framework to enhance the robustness of salient object detection models against such attacks, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses security and privacy concerns related to adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on various datasets, which involves multimedia computing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
