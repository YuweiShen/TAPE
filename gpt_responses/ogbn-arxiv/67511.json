Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed approach for both single and multiple receivers, which falls under the category of networked systems, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a likely sub-category as well. The proposed approach involves recognizing the unknown modulation and coding scheme, which can be seen as a classification problem, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a complete blind receiver approach that jointly estimates the unknown channel state information and noise power, which can be seen as a machine learning problem, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
