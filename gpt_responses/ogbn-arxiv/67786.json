The paper proposes a randomized algorithm to achieve optimal amortized regret in every interval, which is a machine learning optimization problem. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the concept of regret, which is a measure of loss in payoff, and is a common concept in information theory. The paper proposes an algorithm to minimize regret, which is an information-theoretic optimization problem. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a problem of predicting the next bit in a sequence of bits, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The paper proposes a randomized algorithm to achieve optimal amortized regret in every interval, which is an AI optimization problem. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a randomized algorithm to achieve optimal amortized regret in every interval, which is a problem in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper discusses the concept of regret, which is a measure of loss in payoff, and is a common concept in statistics.
