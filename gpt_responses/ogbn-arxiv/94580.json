The use of inverse reward design (IRD) and active learning techniques also suggests a focus on machine learning and optimization. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The use of IRD for updating the distribution over the true reward function suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of feature queries suggests a possible application in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
