The proposed models are all data-driven and involve image processing techniques such as texture agnostic retrieval and Gaussian mixture models. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with large-scale visual recommendations from street fashion images, which falls under the domain of multimedia. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes models for fashion recommendation based on meta-data associated with fashion images, which is a classic problem in information retrieval. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed models are all data-driven and involve machine learning techniques such as Markov Chain LDA and Complementary Nearest Neighbor Consensus. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves analyzing fashion insights learned through experiments, which could potentially involve natural language processing techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
