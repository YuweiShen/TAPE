Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a self-supervised framework that learns to group visual entities based on their rate of co-occurrence in space and time, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper applies the proposed framework to three domains: learning patch affinities from spatial adjacency in images, learning frame affinities from temporal adjacency in videos, and learning photo affinities from geospatial proximity in image collections, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
