The use of weakly supervised learning and the creation of a new dataset also involve natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of synthetic data and the limitations of such data, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
