The paper also discusses the use of local coordinate charts, which is a common technique in differential geometry (cs.DG). Additionally, the paper's focus on algorithms and their guarantees suggests a connection to computational topology (cs.SG) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
