This is a key topic in information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper discusses circular quadrature amplitude modulations (CQAM) which are commonly used in communication systems. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of probabilistic shaping and non-binary codes could have implications for network coding and optimization in social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper may touch on algorithms and data structures used in probabilistic shaping and non-binary codes. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper's discussion of CQAM and probabilistic shaping could have implications for networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
