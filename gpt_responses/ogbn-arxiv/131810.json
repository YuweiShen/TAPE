The paper specifically targets discontinuity, which is an under-explored aspect of MWEs and poses a significant challenge to computational treatment. The paper proposes two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and multi-head self-attention, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and ML tasks related to language processing. The paper also proposes a combined model that integrates complementary information from both GCN and self-attention through a gating mechanism, which involves the use of neural networks and deep learning techniques. Therefore, the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deal with various aspects of ML, AI, and neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
