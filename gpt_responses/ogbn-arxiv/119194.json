The use of field-standardized measurements suggests a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The analysis of data from multiple universities also suggests a focus on cybernetics (cs.CY) and security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the detection of potential differences by field suggests a focus on social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
