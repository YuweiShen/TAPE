The paper focuses on computer vision tasks and uses deep convolutional neural networks for training and testing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper involves the use of machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with geometric relationships between objects, which could place it in the cs.GR (Computer Graphics) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on occlusion estimation could also place it in the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category, as occlusion estimation is important for robotic perception and navigation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
