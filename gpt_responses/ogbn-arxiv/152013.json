Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the accuracy and performance of the proposed model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed model also involves the use of various backbone structures, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The real-time performance of the model is also tested on embedded systems, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the inference speed on NVIDIA Drive PX2 and Jetson Xaviers boards, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
