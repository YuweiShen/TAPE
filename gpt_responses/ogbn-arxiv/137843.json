The main technical tool used is a separation lemma, which is commonly used in optimization and linear programming. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper deals with hypergraphs, which suggests a possible fit with cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
