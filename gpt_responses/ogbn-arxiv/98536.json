The paper also discusses the gap to Shannon capacity, which is a fundamental concept in IT (SI). Finally, the paper analyzes the performance of LRCs, which can be considered a distributed computing problem, falling under the category of distributed computing (DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
