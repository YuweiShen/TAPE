The use of a deterministic approach suggests that it may also fall under the systems and control (SY) category. Additionally, the paper proposes transmission and relay strategies for the Gaussian channel, which could relate to multimedia (MM) and cryptography (CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
