The proposed method uses a supervised regression method and combines local appearances and shapes, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of occlusion patterns as a constraint, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of facial landmark detection, such as in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
