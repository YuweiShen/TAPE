This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n3. cs.RF (Radio Frequency and Microwave Engineering): The paper discusses the advantages of OTFS modulation over OFDM in radar systems, which involves radio frequency and microwave engineering concepts. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new modulation technique for radar systems, which can have potential applications in wireless communications and networking. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm using numerical results, which can be considered as multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
