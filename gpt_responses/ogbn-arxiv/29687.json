Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper uses deep learning models and proposes an end-to-end framework, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence and machine learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of convolutional neural networks, which is a popular technique in deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible sub-category. The paper deals with video processing, which suggests the involvement of multimedia, making cs.MM (Multimedia) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves image processing and feature extraction, which suggests the involvement of information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
