The method is implemented in MATLAB and is compared to an existing optimality criteria method. The paper is likely to belong to the Mechanical Engineering (cs.ME) and Optimization (cs.Optimization) sub-categories, as it deals with optimization methods for mechanical systems. It may also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Civil Engineering (cs.CE), and Electromagnetics (cs.EM) sub-categories, as these fields also involve optimization methods for physical systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
