The paper also considers side-channel attacks, which are a common threat in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of common key cryptosystems and the formulation of a post encryption coding system suggest a focus on cryptography and network security (cs.CY). The paper also discusses the rate constraint noiseless channel, which is a topic in communication theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides an explicit sufficient condition for exponential decay of information leakage, which could be considered a machine learning or statistical inference problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
