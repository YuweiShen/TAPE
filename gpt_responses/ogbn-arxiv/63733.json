The use of simplicial sets to represent the schema of a database suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as simplicial sets are a type of abstract mathematical structure. The use of polygons and paths in assembling and querying databases suggests a connection to cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The use of custom databases assembled from tiles suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning), as this is a common technique in deep learning.
