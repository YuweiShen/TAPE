The paper proposes a symbolic approach using Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) for computing the permanent, which involves dynamic programming and memoization. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
