The use of neural network modules and end-to-end learning also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The case study involves navigating in complex 3-D environments with visual observations, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of models and algorithms to reduce data requirements suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
