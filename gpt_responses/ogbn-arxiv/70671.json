The proposed method involves incorporating triplet embedding into the learning objective, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a popular approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
