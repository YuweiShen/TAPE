The paper also discusses effective throughput, which is a performance metric commonly used in information theory. \n2. cs.GT (Game Theory) - The paper formulates games to allocate effective throughput gains for the two users in the two-user case. Game theory is a central topic in the paper. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper investigates a cache-aided network, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses how users with heterogeneous preferences cooperate in coded caching, which is a topic related to social and information networks. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a caching policy (UPAF) to organize user cooperation, which is a topic related to data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
