This is a core area of research in HCI. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics) - The paper describes the use of spatial augmented reality to create interactive systems. This involves the use of computer graphics to overlay digital content onto the physical world. \n3. cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) - While not a primary focus of the paper, the use of physiological sensors to display users' inner states raises potential privacy and security concerns that could fall under the domain of cybersecurity. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - The use of anthropomorphic augmented avatars could be seen as a form of robotics, as they involve creating digital representations of human-like entities. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper briefly mentions the use of computer vision techniques to track users' movements in the augmented sandbox prototype."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
