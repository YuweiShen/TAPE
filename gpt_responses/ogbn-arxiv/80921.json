This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper analyzes the recovery properties of the proposed approach both theoretically and empirically, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions results in 1-bit compressive sensing, which suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
