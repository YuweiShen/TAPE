It also involves the study of combinatorial objects and their constructions, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper provides fast explicit constructions of synchronization strings, which is related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper also discusses the extremal question of the smallest possible alphabet size, which is related to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
