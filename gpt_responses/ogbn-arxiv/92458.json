The use of kernels is a common approach in nonparametric testing, and the paper focuses on the asymptotic performance of kernel-based tests. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
