The use of pairwise similarities suggests that it may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on efficiency and adaptively selecting similarities suggests that it may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of anomalous similarities suggests that it may also fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV), where dealing with noise and outliers is a common problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
