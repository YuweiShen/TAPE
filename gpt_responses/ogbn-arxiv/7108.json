The paper proposes new NAS baselines and evaluates them on two standard NAS benchmarks. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. The benchmarks used in the paper are related to computer vision (CIFAR-10) and natural language processing (PTB), so cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also likely categories. Finally, the paper involves optimization algorithms and neural networks, which are relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
