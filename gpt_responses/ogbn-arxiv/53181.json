These types of games are commonly studied in the field of game theory (cs.GT) and require efficient data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) to solve. The paper also discusses how awareness of the structural properties of the game can be used to improve the performance of the algorithms, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of previous strategy improvement algorithms, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
