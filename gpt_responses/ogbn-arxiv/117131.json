This involves a large number of compromised nodes generating low-intensity traffic in a coordinated fashion to disconnect target links or hosts from the rest of the network. The paper uses software-defined networking and deep learning algorithms to differentiate legitimate flows from coordinated attacking flows. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security issues, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of machine learning algorithms indicates that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the use of software-defined networking suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
