The use of mobile robots also suggests the category of Robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of graphs and algorithms, which are common topics in the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The investigation of which functions can be computed by the robots suggests the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Finally, the study of the minimum size of a network required for the robots to compute all functions suggests the category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
