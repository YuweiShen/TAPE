The proposed method involves a convolutional model for processing the pose stream and a spatio-temporal soft-attention mechanism conditioned on features from the pose network for handling the raw RGB stream. The method also involves a trainable glimpse sensor that extracts features on a set of predefined locations specified by the pose stream. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a two-stream approach that involves an LSTM network, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves multi-modal video data, which falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with human action recognition, which is a topic of interest in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
