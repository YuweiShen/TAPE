It also involves game theory (cs.GT) as utility functions are often used to model the preferences of players in games. The paper also introduces a new interpretation of utility functions that is similar to probability distributions, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and multiattribute decision-making (cs.MA). Finally, the paper presents the concept of utility networks, which can be seen as a type of graphical model and falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
