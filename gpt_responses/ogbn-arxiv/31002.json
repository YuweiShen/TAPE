The paper discusses the use of an epidemic, delay-tolerant, and intelligent method to transfer data between mobile nodes in MANETs. This method involves establishing a network-wide synchronization overlay to transfer increments of data over intermediate nodes in periodic cycles. The paper also presents an evaluation of the method using a run-time dependence discovery method for web service applications hosted on MANETs. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
