It also involves random coding and parity check ensembles, which are topics studied in the Coding Theory (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also mentions discrete input arbitrary output channels, which are relevant to the Network Information Theory (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper's focus on non-asymptotic achievability bounds and equipartition properties may also make it relevant to the Statistical Learning (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's numerical comparisons with existing bounds may make it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
