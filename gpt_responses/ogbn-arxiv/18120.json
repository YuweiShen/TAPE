The paper also discusses the modeling of data sources and the development of utility and privacy metrics, which are relevant to the subfield of databases (cs.DB). The use of rate distortion theory is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) for quantifying tradeoffs between different metrics. Finally, the paper discusses a successive disclosure problem, which is relevant to the subfield of cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
