The language is an extension of Datalog, which is a logic programming language used in logic and constraint programming (cs.LO) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the language, which is relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a system prototype, which involves programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
