This falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the performance and generalization ability of fuzzing strategies, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). The implementation of the proposed approach involves integrating multiple fuzzing strategies, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions testing on real-world applications, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses ensemble learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
