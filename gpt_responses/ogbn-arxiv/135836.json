The paper specifically focuses on image datasets such as CIFAR-10, indicating a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of sparse recovery methods suggests a connection to machine learning theory (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of a multi-armed bandit strategy, which is commonly used in reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.NE). Overall, the paper's focus on hyperparameter optimization and machine learning theory suggests that cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.DS, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
