The paper also discusses the practical applications of spectral sparsification, such as graph algorithms and partitioning, which fall under the categories of computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on real-world graphs, which could be considered as a topic in social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
