This indicates a strong emphasis on robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) for addressing the challenges in horticultural robotics. Finally, the paper also touches upon the need for reliable and safe deployment of horticultural robots, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
