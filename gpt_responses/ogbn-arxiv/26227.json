The paper deals with interpretability of machine learning models in the context of question answering, which is a common topic in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) research (hence cs.CL and cs.AI). The use of knowledge bases and text documents also suggests a focus on information retrieval (IR) and database (DB) systems. Finally, the evaluation paradigm proposed in the paper involves comparing different explanation methods, which is a common task in machine learning (hence cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
