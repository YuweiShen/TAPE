Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves modeling and classification, which are core topics in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of manual annotation labor, which is relevant to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper deals with video datasets, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
