The use of machine learning algorithms also suggests the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) being involved, making cs.AI another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses feature selection and classification models, which are common topics in machine learning and data mining, making cs.LG a possible sub-category.
