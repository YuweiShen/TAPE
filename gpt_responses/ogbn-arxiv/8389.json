This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics) - The paper deals with removing the glow effect from light sources in night scenes, which is a common problem in computer graphics. Hence, cs.GR is also a likely category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses deep learning techniques to solve the problem of night haze and glow removal, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. Hence, cs.AI is also a likely category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent network for training, which are both machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG is also a likely category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with image processing and restoration, which is a common problem in multimedia applications. Hence, cs.MM is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
