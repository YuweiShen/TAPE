The paper also discusses the discriminative power of GNNs, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve movie recommendation systems, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of linear graph filters, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
