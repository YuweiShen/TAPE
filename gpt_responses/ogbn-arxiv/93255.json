Computer vision techniques are often used in lithography simulation, making cs.CV a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new resist modeling framework utilizing transfer learning and active learning techniques. This indicates the use of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for resist modeling falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the use of learning-based solutions for resist modeling, which often involves neural networks. This makes cs.NE a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses a new resist modeling framework that aims to reduce the amount of data required for acceptable accuracy. This could be considered an emerging technology in the field of lithography simulation, making cs.ET a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
