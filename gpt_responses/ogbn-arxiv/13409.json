The paper explores the use of both shallow texture features and deep features for characterizing faces, which suggests that it could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of deep learning also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and the machine learning sub-category. The paper also involves extensive experiments, which could suggest that it could belong to the learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of facial dynamics in kinship verification could suggest that it could belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of videos in addition to still images could suggest that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
