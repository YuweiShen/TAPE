The use of text summaries and qualitative analysis of dataset attributes also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the characteristics of data summaries and how people make sense of data, which could fall under the categories of databases (cs.DB) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper presents guidelines for improving the data-search experience, which could also relate to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning techniques for search and recommendation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
