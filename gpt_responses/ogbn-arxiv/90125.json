The paper also discusses the complexity of the minimisation problem, which is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper introduces a new technique for minimisation of deterministic finite automata, which is a topic related to programming languages (cs.PL) and compilers (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
