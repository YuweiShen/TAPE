The use of helpers and cooperative jamming also involves networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of Gaussian distributions and the optimization of degrees of freedom can be related to machine learning and optimization (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
