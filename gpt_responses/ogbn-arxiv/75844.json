The paper also discusses the use of random measurement matrices, which is a common technique in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper considers constraint sets with small covering numbers or Minkowski dimensions, which are topics related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses stable matrix recovery, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
