It also involves the use of model checking, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The state space explosion problem is a well-known issue in model checking, which is a topic in distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, component-based systems are often used in control systems and embedded systems, which are topics in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
