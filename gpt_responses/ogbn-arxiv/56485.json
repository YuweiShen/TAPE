The paper proposes a novel framework that utilizes dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to solve the challenges faced by existing SISR methods. This involves exploring the mismatch between training and inference mobile data, handling blind distortions during super resolution, and effectively handling detail recovery and denoising. Therefore, the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CV, followed by cs.LG (machine learning), cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.MM (multimedia), and cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
