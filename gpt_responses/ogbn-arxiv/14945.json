However, the focus on autocorrelation and linear complexity suggests that the paper is more likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of sequence polynomial approach also suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) or Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories.
