The paper also proposes a novel metric to measure the percentage of data that are sent to the interpretable model for decision and a principled objective function that considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and data explainability. These are all related to machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for building a hybrid decision model that integrates an interpretable model with any black-box model to introduce explanations in the decision-making process while preserving or possibly improving the predictive accuracy. This is related to artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): There is no direct mention of cryptography and security in the paper. However, the proposed framework and model can be applied to domains where humans are involved in the decision-making process, which may include security-related applications.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper proposes a framework for building a hybrid decision model that integrates an interpretable model with any black-box model to introduce explanations in the decision-making process while preserving or possibly improving the predictive accuracy. This is related to the impact of technology on society and the ethical considerations of using black-box models in decision-making.\n- cs.H"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
