The method involves averaging model weights instead of label predictions, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of Residual Networks, which is a popular architecture in deep learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on image classification tasks, which is a common application of deep learning in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
