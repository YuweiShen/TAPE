This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed framework involves deep learning techniques, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The framework also involves refinement and regression techniques, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
