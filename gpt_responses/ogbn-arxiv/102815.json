The paper also proposes a new method of constructing complex BW lattice codes, which involves linear codes over polynomial rings, and discusses low-complexity decoding algorithms, which are topics in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also analyzes the error performance of the decoding algorithm, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses noise statistics and proposes a new upper bound, which is a topic in dynamical systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a novel noise-trimming technique, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
