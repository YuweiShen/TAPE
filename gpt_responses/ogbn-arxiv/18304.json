The use of the sum-of-squares (SOS) proof system suggests a connection to complexity theory and computational complexity (cs.CC). The mention of the Frankl R Odl graph suggests a connection to graph theory and combinatorics (cs.DM). The use of hypercontractive inequalities in probability theory suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could fall under cs.IT and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
