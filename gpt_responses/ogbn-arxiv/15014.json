The paper specifically focuses on momentum-based stochastic gradient methods, which are commonly used in this field. Therefore, sub-categories related to optimization (cs.NA), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
