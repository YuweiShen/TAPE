Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions a high-level mission planner and a design and simulation tool, which involve artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and modeling and simulation (cs.SY) respectively. The paper also discusses the integration of motion planners and feedback controllers, which falls under the field of control theory and optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the hardware experiments, which involve software engineering (cs.SE) for implementing the system on the modular robot hardware."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
