The use of tree structures and the logarithm scoring rule also suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI) due to its focus on propagating beliefs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
