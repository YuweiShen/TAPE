This is a topic within data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the dimensions of decidable, \\Sigma^0_1, or \\Pi^0_1 sequences, which are topics within logic in computer science. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the dimension of sequences that are random relative to any computable sequence of coin-toss biases that converge to a real number \\beta in (0,1), which is a topic within cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
