The use of preliminary information to speed up computation is also related to algorithms and complexity, which are covered by cs.DM. The study of the dual problem involves optimization, which falls under cs.GR. Finally, the mention of \"oblivious\" points suggests a connection to control and systems theory, which is covered by cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
