The paper specifically focuses on deep convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The proposed algorithm involves selecting optimal paths for new tasks while encouraging parameter sharing and reuse, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also integrates knowledge distillation and retrospection to overcome catastrophic forgetting, which is a common problem in incremental learning (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes a simple controller to dynamically balance the model plasticity, which is a common technique in neural network optimization (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
