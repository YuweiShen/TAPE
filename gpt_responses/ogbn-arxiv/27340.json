The approach involves using a deep convolutional neural network to regress 3D object properties and combining these estimates with geometric constraints to produce a complete 3D bounding box. This work is likely to be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including computer vision (cs.CV), robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
