The individualization-refinement paradigm is a popular approach for solving this problem and is often used in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The construction of graphs with exponential lower bounds involves concepts from computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, which is a popular tool in machine learning and falls under the category of learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
