Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also uses machine learning techniques for precomputing embeddings, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another possible category. The paper also deals with named entity recognition, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves the use of Czech language, which makes cs.CY (Computational Linguistics) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
