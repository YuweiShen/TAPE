This makes it highly likely to belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also discusses the ML pipeline of CAVs, potential security issues, and adversarial ML attacks, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of wireless communications and the focus on road safety suggest that it could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the transformation of the vehicular ecosystem, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
