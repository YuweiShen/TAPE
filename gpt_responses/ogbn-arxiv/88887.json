Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the merits and limitations of different measures, which involves machine learning and statistical techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of distributional and ontology-based measures, which involves computational complexity and algorithmic design, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
