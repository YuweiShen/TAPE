The paper also discusses the regret of the mechanism, which is a common concept in game theory. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a mechanism based on ideas from the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) family of MAB algorithms, which is a popular machine learning technique. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses sponsored search auctions as a concrete example, which is a common application in information retrieval. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a deterministic MAB mechanism, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a mechanism for stochastic MAB, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
