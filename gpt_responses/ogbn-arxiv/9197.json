The paper also mentions coding across data streams, which is a technique used in distributed systems (cs.DS) and information theory. The tradeoff between network load and cache memory is a topic in both networking and distributed computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of caching as the number of files and users increase, which is a topic in distributed computing and databases (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
