The paper also uses stochastic optimal control theory and variational equalities, which are topics in control systems (cs.SY). The paper applies the results to linear autoregressive channel models, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also applies the results to Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Gaussian Linear Channel Models, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the separation principle between the computation of the elements of the optimal strategies, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
