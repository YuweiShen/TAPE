This approach may have implications for the design of data structures and algorithms for efficient encoding and decoding of such codes. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper may have implications for distributed computing, as deletion correcting codes are useful in fault-tolerant distributed systems. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper may have implications for the design of error-correcting codes for communication networks, which are a key component of social and information networks. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper may have implications for the study of the computational complexity of constructing deletion correcting codes, as the proposed approach requires near-optimal redundancy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
