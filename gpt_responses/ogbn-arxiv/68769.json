This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new multiple UAVs framework for serving terrestrial NOMA users, which involves networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper considers a stochastic geometry technique for the proposed framework, which falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of UAVs as new aerial communication platforms, which can be used for multimedia applications.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography and security, but the proposed framework may have implications for security in UAV communications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
