This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper focuses on improving the performance of wireless communications, which is a key area of research in communications and networking.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of non-iterative/one-shot decoding algorithms, which is relevant to the networking and internet architecture community.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a signal-to-noise ratio-adaptive system, which falls under the scope of systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not the primary focus of the paper, the use of optimized constellations can also be relevant to multimedia applications that require high-quality transmission of audio and video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
