This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the construction of tight spans, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper mentions applications in testing for isometric embeddings, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
