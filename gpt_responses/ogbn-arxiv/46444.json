The use of multiple antennas by users and the consideration of spatially correlated multipath fading suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of the Weichselberger correlation model and the focus on spectral efficiency make the paper relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the consideration of future system designs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
