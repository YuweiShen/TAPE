However, the focus on contrast analysis and the use of coherence metrics suggest that the paper is most likely to belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The paper also deals with data mining (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), which are all related to graph pattern mining.
