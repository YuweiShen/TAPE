This technique is applicable to a wide variety of models, including convolutional neural networks (cs.CV), recurrent neural networks (cs.NE), and generative adversarial networks (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of single-precision copies of weights and scaling of loss, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for future processors to have half-precision hardware units, which is relevant to computer architecture (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
