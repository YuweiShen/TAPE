The use of preferences and Nash equilibria also suggests a connection to algorithmic game theory. The paper proposes a protocol that is information-theoretically secure and resilient to coalitions of players. These topics are typically covered in the sub-categories of cryptography (cs.CR), information theory (cs.IT), game theory (cs.GT), distributed computing (cs.DC), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
