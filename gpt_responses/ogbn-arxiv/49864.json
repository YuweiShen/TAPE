This involves designing and implementing a robot (drone) that can learn and make decisions based on its environment and objectives.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper involves using computer vision techniques to extract aesthetical features of retrospective shots in order to extract a desirable policy for better prospective shots. This involves analyzing and processing visual data to make decisions.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a learning scheme which exploits aesthetical features of retrospective shots in order to extract a desirable policy for better prospective shots. This involves designing and implementing an intelligent agent that can learn and make decisions based on its environment and objectives.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves generating and analyzing video shots for aerial cinematography. This involves designing and implementing graphics algorithms and techniques to create visually appealing shots.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves analyzing and processing multimedia data (video shots) to make decisions for aerial cinematography. This involves designing and implementing algorithms and techniques for multimedia analysis and processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
