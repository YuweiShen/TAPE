The problem involves the agents moving in an unknown network, which suggests that it could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The agents have to meet at the same node, which suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category. The agents are subject to crash faults, which suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category.
