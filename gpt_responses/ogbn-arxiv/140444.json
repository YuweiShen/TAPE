This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed QCPS model involves parallel computation and communication for efficient query processing. This falls under the domain of distributed and parallel computing.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The use of CPS for better interaction with the physical world and reduction of system cost and energy consumption falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes an efficient query processing approach for multiple heterogeneous sensor networks. This involves the use of data structures and algorithms for processing queries.\n5. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper involves the processing of queries for multiple heterogeneous sensor networks.
