The paper also mentions applications in computer graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO), indicating that it may be relevant to those sub-categories as well. The use of algorithms for estimating scene configurations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
