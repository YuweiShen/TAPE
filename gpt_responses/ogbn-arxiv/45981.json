The paper also leverages geometric consistency as additional supervisory signals, which is a common technique in computer vision. The paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as depth and optical flow estimation are important for robot navigation and perception. The paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a joint learning framework for two related tasks. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as depth and optical flow estimation are important for many AI applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Finally, the paper may be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) as it involves 3D scene flow and optical flow estimation, which are important for computer graphics applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
