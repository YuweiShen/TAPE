The use of no-signaling strategies also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). Game theory (cs.GT) may also be relevant due to the competing teams of provers. The paper also involves decision problems, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
