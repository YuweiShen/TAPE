The paper also introduces a graph representation to capture the statistical relationship among codewords, which is related to network analysis (cs.NI) and social network analysis (cs.SI). The use of random coding techniques is also mentioned, which is a common technique in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the derivation of error bounds, which is related to probability theory and statistics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
