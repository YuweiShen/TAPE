The paper also uses recursive neural networks (RNNs) to compose the implications of multi-hop relational paths, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with a large dataset of relational triples, which is a topic of interest in database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper uses RNNs to predict new relation types not seen during training, which is a form of zero-shot learning, a topic of interest in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
