The proposed framework incorporates a recurrent spatial-aware refinement module that dynamically locates an attentional region and transforms it to the suitable scale and rotation for optimal crowd estimation, which involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The paper also conducts extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks, which involves multimedia (MM) and robotics (RO) applications. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
