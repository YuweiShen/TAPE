The approach is general and can be applied to D dimensional signals, but the algorithms proposed to practically implement such architectures apply to 2-D and 3-D signals. The paper focuses on the use of a hybrid transform/prediction correlation model for local signal reconstruction, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Multimedia (cs.MM), Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI), and Signal Processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
