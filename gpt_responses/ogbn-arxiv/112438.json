The paper proposes a new neural network architecture for learning post-hoc calibration functions, which is a technique used in many applications of deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of regularization techniques, which are commonly used in neural networks and could place it in the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
