The paper proposes a new framework called CENI that integrates clustering strategies to improve the efficiency of network inference. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Statistical Mechanics (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper discusses the structure of cascades and the critical dimension problem, which are related to the field of Sociology (cs.SOC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
