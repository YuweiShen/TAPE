The paper also discusses the use of adversarial attacks to evade detection, which is a topic of interest in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of image processing techniques to analyze PDF files also makes the paper relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of designing robust systems, which is a topic of interest in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
