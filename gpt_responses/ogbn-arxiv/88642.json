This involves tuning a large set of physical and MAC layer control parameters to adapt to varying network scenarios. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the use of neural networks and other machine learning techniques for optimization and control tasks. The paper's use of deep reinforcement learning falls under this category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers a broad range of topics related to machine learning, including optimization, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. The paper's focus on using deep learning for protocol design optimization makes it a likely candidate for this category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the mathematical foundations of information processing and communication. The paper's discussion of physical and MAC layer control parameters in wireless networks suggests a connection to information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category covers topics related to network protocols, architectures, and applications. The paper's focus on MAC protocol design optimization in wireless networks makes it a likely candidate for this category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers a broad range of topics related to artificial intelligence, including machine learning, optimization, and control.
