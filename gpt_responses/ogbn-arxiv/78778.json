The use of a dynamic model and solving for friction impulses and slip speed suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) aspect to the work. The derivation of closed form solutions and simulation examples also suggest a computational engineering (cs.CE) and multimedia (cs.MM) aspect to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
