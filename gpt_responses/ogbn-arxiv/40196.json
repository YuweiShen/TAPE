The two applications showcased in the paper are image compression (cs.CV) and neural network compression (cs.AI). The paper also involves entropy coding, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with multimedia (cs.MM) in the context of image compression. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
