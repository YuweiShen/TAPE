Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.MM) sub-categories. The use of optimization frameworks and statistical features also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
