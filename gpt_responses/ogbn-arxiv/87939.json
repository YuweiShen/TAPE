The study also considers the impact of realistic channel and antenna radiation models on the coverage analysis, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a framework for evaluating the system performance under different scenarios, which involves mathematical modeling and analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
