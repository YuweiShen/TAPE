The paper proposes a parallel algorithm for this problem using the multilinear relaxation technique. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), distributed computing (cs.DC), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
