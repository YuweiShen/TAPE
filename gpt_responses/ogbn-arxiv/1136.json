The use of Deep-Learning models for DDI extraction also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for extracting embedded information from text, which could place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. Finally, the use of Attention Mechanisms in the proposed model suggests that it could also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
