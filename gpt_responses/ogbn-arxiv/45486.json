The paper also presents a new approach that works across parameter regimes, which could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the performance of algorithms, which could be relevant to researchers in data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
