This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) domains. The use of keypoints to formalize lesions is a novel approach and involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the proposed method is in the medical field, specifically in radiology, which falls under the medical imaging (cs.MED) category. Finally, the use of neural networks for lesion detection makes it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NEURON) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
