This topic falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new transmission scheme that combines the Maddah-Ali and Tse scheme (MAT) with Zero-Forcing (ZF), which involves signal processing and communication protocols, making it relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI), Communications (cs.COMM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
