Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of massive MIMO, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia), and optimization of power transfer efficiency, which falls under cs.PE (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
