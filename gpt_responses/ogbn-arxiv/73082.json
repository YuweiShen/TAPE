The paper also discusses the practical constraints of half-duplex communication, which is relevant to system design and implementation, and therefore could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions coding schemes, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
