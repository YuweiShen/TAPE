The paper also touches on the impact of these systems on individuals' perceptions, which falls under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of simulations to demonstrate the effects of algorithmic confounding suggests a focus on machine learning and data analysis, which are covered in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories. Finally, the potential impact on life-altering decisions suggests a focus on human-computer interaction, which is covered in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
