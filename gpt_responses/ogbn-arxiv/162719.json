Additionally, the paper focuses on affective communication and human-computer interaction, which are subfields of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also uses machine learning algorithms for clustering and prediction, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper analyzes behavior in two different domains, deception detection and communication skill assessment, which are relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses video recordings as input data, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
