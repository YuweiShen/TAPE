This involves analyzing the channel irradiance fluctuations and estimating the maximum likelihood parameters using the EM algorithm. Information theory concepts such as outage probability, bit-error rate, and ergodic capacity are also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with underwater wireless optical communication systems, which are a type of wireless network. The proposed statistical model can be used to analyze the performance of such networks in the presence of turbulence-induced fading due to air bubbles and temperature gradient. \n3. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper is related to the field of optics and photonics, which is not covered by any of the other arXiv CS sub-categories. \n4. cs.PH (Physics): The paper involves studying the statistics of optical beam irradiance fluctuations in underwater environments, which is a physical phenomenon. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with software engineering, the proposed statistical model and its closed-form expressions for performance metrics can be useful for designing and optimizing underwater wireless optical communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
