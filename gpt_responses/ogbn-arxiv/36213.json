This involves image processing techniques and geometric transformations, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) research. The use of DEM and projections also suggests that the paper may fall under robotics (cs.RO) and information theory (cs.IT) categories. Additionally, the paper involves modeling and simulation of signals and functions, which could also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
