The system also incorporates digital signal processing techniques such as signal shaping and digital backpropagation, which fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed system in terms of spectral efficiency, which is a key metric in the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
