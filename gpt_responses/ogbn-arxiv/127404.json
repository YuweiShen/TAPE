This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of frequency filters, which could also be related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art descriptors, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
