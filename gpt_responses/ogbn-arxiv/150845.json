These techniques are commonly used in the fields of neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the developed DNN in understanding abnormal movement patterns due to neurological injury and stimulation-based interventions for neurological recovery, which are relevant to the sub-category of computational biology (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
