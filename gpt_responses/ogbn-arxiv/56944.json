The paper also discusses the robustness of these networks to adversarial attacks, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The attacks themselves involve manipulating the input data, which is a topic related to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of these attacks on safety-critical applications like self-driving cars, which is a topic related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
