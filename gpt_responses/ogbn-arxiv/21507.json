The use of similarity-based algorithms and the need for scalability and precision suggest that the paper could also fit in the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the description of the approach taken for the computation of large-scale graphs suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of scientific computing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
