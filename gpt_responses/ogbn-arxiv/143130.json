It also involves communication networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper uses mathematical techniques such as outer bounds and inner bounds, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions an example involving two semi-deterministic components, which could be related to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
