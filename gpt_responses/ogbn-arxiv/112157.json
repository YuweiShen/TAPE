The concept of solitonic wave-like behavior is often studied in dynamical systems (cs.DS) and statistical physics (cs.SI). The formula for the propagation velocity of the wave involves numerical methods and simulations (cs.NA). Finally, the two applications mentioned, Generalized LDPC codes and compressive sensing, are both topics in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
