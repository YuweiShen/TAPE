This involves the use of proprioceptive sensors and sensorimotor primitives to pre-train a fixed spinal module, which is then connected to a cortical network for behavior modulation. This approach involves elements of robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE), and computer vision (cs.CV) in terms of sensor processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
