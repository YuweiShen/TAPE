This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) as the authors propose a deep learning-based approach for learning fusion weighting and temporal weighting simultaneously. The paper also deals with autonomous navigation, which falls under the domain of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it discusses the performance of the proposed approach in classification and regression tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
