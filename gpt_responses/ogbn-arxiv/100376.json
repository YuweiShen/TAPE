This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses sales data to automate size normalization, which involves retrieving and processing information from a large dataset. This falls under the domain of information retrieval.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to automate size normalization, which involves training models to learn the mapping between different size systems. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves processing natural language descriptions of clothing sizes to generate size mappings, which falls under the domain of computational linguistics.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves analyzing images of clothing items to extract size information, which falls under the domain of multimedia analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
