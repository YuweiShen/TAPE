The paper also discusses the concept of invariance to nuisance factors, which is a key aspect of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analytical expressions derived in the paper involve mathematical concepts such as sampling and group invariance, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
