The use of dense multiple ring modulation formats suggests a possible application in network information theory (cs.NI). The reduction of the differential model to an algebraic model may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and multiple-input multiple-output systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
