This involves using adversarial perturbations to reduce the quality of the detected faces. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves attacking schemes and disrupting state-of-the-art DNN based face detectors, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of adversarial perturbations to disrupt DNNs also falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves manipulating multimedia content, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves the use of AI technologies, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
