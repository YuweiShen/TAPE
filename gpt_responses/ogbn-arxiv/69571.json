This is a fundamental problem in graph theory and is closely related to many classic problems in algorithms and data structures. Therefore, cs.DS is the most likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with the problem of finding a minimum set of vertices that hits all the cycles of a graph. This is a problem in discrete mathematics and is closely related to many other problems in combinatorics and graph theory. Therefore, cs.DM is also a likely category for this paper.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper uses some geometric insights to design the local search algorithm for the FVS problem. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the computational geometry community, which is interested in algorithmic problems with geometric flavor.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The FVS problem is closely related to the concept of feedback arc set in directed graphs, which is a classic problem in game theory. Therefore, cs.GT is also a possible category for this paper.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of the FVS problem in minor-free graphs and presents a PTAS for the problem.
