The paper also discusses closed loop elongation control of the actuator, which is a common problem in robotics.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The proposed sensing approach is based on computer vision techniques, specifically predicting the three-dimensional position of a point of interest on the actuator using an integrated camera.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses closed loop control of the actuator, which falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques to train and evaluate the algorithm for predicting the position of the point of interest on the actuator.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses an off-the-shelf distance sensor as a baseline for comparison, which falls under the domain of multimedia sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
