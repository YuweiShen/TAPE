The examples of functional data mentioned in the abstract, such as spectra and images, suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of projections and sub-spaces is a common technique in statistics and signal processing, which could place the paper in the sub-categories of cs.ST or cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
