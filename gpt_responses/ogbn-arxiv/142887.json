The paper proposes a compact convolutional neural network for crowd counting, which involves deep learning techniques and falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the efficiency and speed of the proposed model, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
