The model is also biologically-plausible, which suggests a connection to neural networks and neuromorphic computing (cs.NE). The hardware implementation on an FPGA board falls under robotics (cs.RO) and embedded systems (cs.EM). The paper also mentions the need for computational efficiency, which is a common concern in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
