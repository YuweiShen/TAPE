These tasks are commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of clustering, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the pre-processing step is important for the overall system performance, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
