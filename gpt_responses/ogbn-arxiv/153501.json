The paper formulates the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with an information-theoretic objective function, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a new sample-based approximation for mutual information, which is a machine learning technique and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper uses forward simulation algorithms to solve the POMDP, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results in simulated and real environments, which involves computer vision techniques for environment perception and mapping, and falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
