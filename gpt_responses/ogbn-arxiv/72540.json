The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the STBCs, which is related to signal processing and optimization, and could be classified under the signal processing (cs.SI) and optimization (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents some results on the construction of STBCs using linear dispersion matrices, which could be relevant to the networked systems (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
