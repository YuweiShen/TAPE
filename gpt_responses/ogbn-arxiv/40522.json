This technology involves communication and networking (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), robotics (cs.RO), and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of millimeter-wave transmission is a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
