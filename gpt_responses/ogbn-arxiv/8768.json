The paper also presents an analytical model based on a Markov process, which is a common tool in stochastic processes (cs.SI) and probability theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed model in practical scenarios, such as selecting the best density for transmission, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
