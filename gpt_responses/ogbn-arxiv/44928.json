The paper also discusses power allocation and channel conditions, which are topics covered in the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of wireless communication in the context of industrial IoT suggests that the paper may also belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The optimization problem formulation and solution may also place the paper in the mathematical optimization (cs.MA) sub-category. Finally, the comparison of the proposed method with conventional methods may involve machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
