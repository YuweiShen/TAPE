This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed model uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant parts of the images, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper deals with video surveillance, which is a sub-topic of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
