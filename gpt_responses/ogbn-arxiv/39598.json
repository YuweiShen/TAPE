The paper also discusses the reliability and robustness of neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a novel regularization technique, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
