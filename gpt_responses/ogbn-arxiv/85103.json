This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also explores transfer learning principles, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted on Atari 2600 games, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves processing visual input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
