The paper also proposes a theoretical model for planning with these biases, which involves game-theoretic considerations (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the planning problem, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also uses machine learning techniques to differentiate between sophisticated and naive agents (cs.LG), and the paper's focus on behavioral phenomena suggests a connection to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
