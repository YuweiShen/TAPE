The use of confidence intervals and statistical techniques to evaluate worker error rates suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper's focus on evaluating workers in scenarios where not all workers have attempted every task and where tasks have non-boolean responses suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
