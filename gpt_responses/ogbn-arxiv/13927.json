The paper also uses combinatorial techniques to analyze the success of LP decoding, which suggests a possible connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the notion of probabilistic expansion in random bipartite graphs, which could be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
