This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with video streaming and proposes a strategy to enhance the widely used Adaptive BitRate (ABR) streaming technology. This falls under the domain of multimedia. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to minimize the backhaul network cost subject to cache storage and processing capacity constraints. This falls under the domain of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a novel online algorithm that makes cache placement and video scheduling decisions upon the arrival of each new request. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes an online algorithm to make cache placement and video scheduling decisions. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
