The techniques used in the paper involve concepts such as low evaluation dimension, basis isolating weight assignment, and low-support rank concentration, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.SC). The paper also discusses the complexity of the blackbox algorithm, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
