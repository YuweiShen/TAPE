The paper also mentions content-delivery networks, which falls under the category of networked systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the optimization of caching schemes, which involves algorithms and data structures, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) likely sub-categories as well.
