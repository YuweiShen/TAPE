It also discusses the challenges of concurrent evaluation, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses different table space designs, which are data structures used for efficient storage and retrieval of tabling information, and memory usage, which are topics related to data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the role of the engine's memory allocator and mode-directed tabling support, which are topics related to logic and constraint programming (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
