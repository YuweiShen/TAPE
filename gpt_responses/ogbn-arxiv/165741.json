This suggests that the paper could belong to the databases (cs.DB) or information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new programming abstraction for on-loading contextual data, which could fall under the software engineering (cs.SE) or programming languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the energy consumption and execution time of the proposed system, which could be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the processing of large amounts of data, which could be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
