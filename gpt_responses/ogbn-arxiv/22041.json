It also mentions the Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) DARPA program, which further supports its classification under cs.CR. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it discusses the use of static taint-flow analysis and least permissions analysis to expand the class of malicious behaviors which it can catch. \n\nThe paper mentions the use of pushdown systems and Entry-Point Saturation (EPS), which are techniques commonly used in programming languages and compilers, suggesting a possible classification under cs.PL (Programming Languages). \n\nThe paper also presents a rich user interface support for human analysts, which could suggest a classification under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves human-machine interaction. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on control-flow analysis and exception-driven control-flow could suggest a classification under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
