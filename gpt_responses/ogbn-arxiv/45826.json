The use of control barrier functions (CBFs) and quadratic programming (QP) for safe control is also a common technique in robotics.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a cascaded control architecture for quadrotors, which is a topic within the field of systems and control. The use of CBFs and QP for enforcing safety constraints is also a common technique in this field.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of QP and CBFs can be seen as a form of optimization and learning. Additionally, the paper may be of interest to researchers working on machine learning for robotics.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper may be of interest to researchers working on AI for robotics, as the use of CBFs and QP can be seen as a form of intelligent control.\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, quadrotors are often used in conjunction with computer vision systems for tasks such as object tracking and mapping. The paper may be of interest to researchers working on computer vision for robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
