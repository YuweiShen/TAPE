This suggests a connection to logic in computer science. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that programs today are more distributed and concurrent than ever before, and that structural communications are at the core. This suggests a connection to distributed computing. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the difficulty of constructing and debugging concurrent programs, and proposes a type system as a solution. This suggests a connection to software engineering. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Although not the main focus of the paper, the type system proposed in the paper can be seen as a data structure for enforcing communication protocols. This suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
