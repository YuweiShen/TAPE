Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses modifications to the protocol's congestion window update mechanism, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper provides closed-form expressions for throughput and queue occupancy, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
