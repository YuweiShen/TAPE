The use of choice functions and qualitative probability measures suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The characterization of classical propositional connectives suggests a connection to computational logic (cs.CL) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the study of consequence operations suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
