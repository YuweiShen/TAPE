The paper also discusses the use of evolutionary strategies to generate adversarial noise, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential implications of the new attack surface it presents, which suggests that it may also belong to the computer security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of gradients in adversarial attacks, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
