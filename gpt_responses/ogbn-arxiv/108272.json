The proposed method is based on deep learning (cs.LG) and specifically uses a neural network to estimate the bounding box. The paper also discusses the use of prior information and the handling of unordered points, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
