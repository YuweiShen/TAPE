This makes it likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the physical layer and channel modeling, which suggests the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of mmWave frequencies also indicates the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also discusses the challenges of blockage and intermittent channel quality, which suggests the Augmented Reality (cs.AR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes solutions for improving the end-to-end performance, which suggests the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
