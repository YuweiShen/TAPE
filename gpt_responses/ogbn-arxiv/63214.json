This involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.AR), as well as optimization and control theory (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the application of these techniques to wireline and wireless channels (cs.SI), and presents experimental results (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
