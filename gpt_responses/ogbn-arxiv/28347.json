The proposed solution involves the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which is a popular area of research in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the dynamics control of AVs, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SY, and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
