Moreover, the problem can be interpreted as a game between two players, where one player chooses a set of vertices and the other player chooses a cycle that is not intersected by the chosen set.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper mentions that the problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, which is a concept from computational complexity theory. Moreover, the paper presents an approximation algorithm, which is a common approach to deal with NP-hard problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
