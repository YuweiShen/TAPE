The proposed coded single-tone signaling scheme involves coding techniques, which are studied in information theory (cs.IT). The use of over-the-air signaling and channel estimation also falls under the subfield of communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the properties of the proposed scheme, which can be considered as system-level analysis and optimization, falling under the subfield of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme through simulations, which can be considered as a multimedia computing and networking application (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
