The paper also discusses routing, control, and monitoring of fleets, which are topics related to robotics (cs.RO). The use of symmetric key cryptography and the limited resources of consumer drones suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a complete solution for creating end-to-end secured fleets of consumer drones, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
