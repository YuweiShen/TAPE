The use of convolutional neural networks and big data also suggests that the paper could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the models compared to human judgments, which could fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper mentions a systematic search through feedforward neural architectures, which suggests that it could also fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
