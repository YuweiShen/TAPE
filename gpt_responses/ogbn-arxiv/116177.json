The paper uses techniques from algebraic complexity theory, which is a subfield of computational complexity theory that studies the algebraic properties of computational problems. Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with combinatorial and algebraic properties of selector functions, which are related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also uses information theory (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.GT) to establish some of its results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
