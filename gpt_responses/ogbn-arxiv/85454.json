It may also belong to Robotics (cs.RO) as these tasks are important for automated vehicles. Machine Learning (cs.LG) is another likely category as the paper proposes a neural network architecture to solve both tasks simultaneously. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) are less likely categories as they are not directly related to the tasks at hand."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
