This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely sub-category.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper deals with developing a stock trading system using technical analysis indicators and big data framework. This involves computational techniques and financial modeling, making cs.CE a likely sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of artificial neural networks for stock price prediction and trading, which falls under the domain of AI. Hence, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the retrieval and analysis of financial time series data for stock trading, which involves techniques such as data mining and information retrieval. Hence, cs.IR is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper involves the use of Apache Spark big data framework for training the neural network model. This involves database management and distributed computing, making cs.DB a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
