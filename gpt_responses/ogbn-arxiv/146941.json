Therefore, cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are likely sub-categories. The paper also employs randomized online primal dual analysis, which involves information theory and optimization, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible sub-category.
