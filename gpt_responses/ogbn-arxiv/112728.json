The use of a programming language and the focus on computation suggest that cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with higher-dimensional structures, which could fall under cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.IT (Information Theory). The examples of a higher inductive type and the univalence principle suggest a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
