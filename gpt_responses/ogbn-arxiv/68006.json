The paper discusses beamforming techniques and capacity calculations, which are common topics in the information theory sub-category (cs.IT). The paper also deals with security and eavesdropping, which falls under the computer security and cryptography sub-category (cs.CR). The use of computer simulations suggests that the paper may also fall under the multimedia sub-category (cs.MM) or the networking and internet architecture sub-category (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with optimization and control, which could place it in the systems and control sub-category (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
