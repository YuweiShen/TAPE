This involves wireless transmission and communication among the mobile devices, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses federated learning, which is a machine learning approach that involves training models on decentralized data sources. The paper also proposes a game-theoretic model for analyzing the interaction among the mobile devices and the model owner, which is a common approach in machine learning research.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper involves the transmission and communication of information, which is a core topic in information theory. The use of a cooperative relay network also involves the study of channel coding and decoding techniques.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a cooperative communication platform for federated learning, which involves the design and analysis of control systems for managing the interaction among the mobile devices and the model owner. The game-theoretic model also involves the study of decision-making and optimization in systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper involves the use of mobile devices for federated learning, which may involve the processing and analysis of multimedia data such as images and videos.
