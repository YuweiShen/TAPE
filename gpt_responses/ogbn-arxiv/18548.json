The paper also proposes a novel approach based on a labeled LDA model, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also includes a user study, which suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect.
