These topics are related to information theory and signal processing.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper focuses on digital image representation and introduces basis images that can be used for orthogonal transformations of multi-dimensional arrays. This is a common topic in computer vision and image processing.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses image coding and watermarking, which are important applications in multimedia.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a block matrix that is suitable for orthogonal transforms of multi-dimensional arrays, which is a topic related to data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss machine learning, the concept of basis images and orthogonal transformations is commonly used in machine learning for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
