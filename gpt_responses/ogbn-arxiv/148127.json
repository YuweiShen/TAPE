The approach involves training a language model and using a shared latent space for the two modalities, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with multimodal embeddings, which is a topic that falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
