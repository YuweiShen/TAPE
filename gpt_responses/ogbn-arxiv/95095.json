The proposed method involves exploiting the frequency domain, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing and image analysis, indicating a possible fit for the sub-field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. Additionally, the use of neural networks in the proposed method suggests a possible fit for the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
