Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves power allocation and user pairing, which are related to information theory and optimization, respectively. Hence, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also likely categories. The paper also evaluates the performance of NOMA in terms of resource efficiency and load balancing, which are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
