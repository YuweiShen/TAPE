The use of random regular digraphs to achieve optimal streaming capacity and delay involves graph theory, which is also studied in the social and information networks (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the properties of the graph formed by the union of multiple random 1-regular digraphs, which involves information theory and coding (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
