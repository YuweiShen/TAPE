The paper proposes a modification to the training strategy of deep learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces an auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on two different datasets, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
