This involves logical reasoning and may be of interest to researchers in this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper presents a type system for a programming language with various type constructors and discusses its practical use. It also includes examples of applications such as typing recursors for datatypes and injections between mixed inductive and coinductive types. These topics are relevant to researchers in the programming languages sub-category.\n- cs.TL (Type Theory): The paper presents a type system with subtyping and discusses its properties such as soundness and strong normalization. This is of interest to researchers in the type theory sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the practical use of the presented type system and includes examples of applications. This may be of interest to researchers in the software engineering sub-category.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the type system for a formal language and includes examples of applications such as typing recursors for datatypes.
