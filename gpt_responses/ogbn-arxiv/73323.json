The paper presents new parallel algorithms for the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma (LLLL), which is a generalization of the Lovasz Local Lemma. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) categories. The paper also mentions the use of a new primitive for parallel computing, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) and Network Architecture and Analysis (cs.NE) categories. Finally, the paper presents algorithms for probability spaces such as matchings and Hamiltonian cycles, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
