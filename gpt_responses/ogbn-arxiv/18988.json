While this method could apply to many unsupervised settings, the paper focuses on applications in anomaly detection, where little task-labeled data is available. The paper discusses techniques for maximizing within-set variance and minimizing between-set variance to identify and remove distracting features while retaining fidelity to the descriptiveness needed at test time. The paper also discusses a linear formulation that reduces to a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved quickly and applied to test sets outside the context of the training sets. Based on these descriptions, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CR, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
