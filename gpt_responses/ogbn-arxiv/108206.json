The paper also mentions the development and implementation of decision procedures for arithmetic theories, which falls under the category of logic (cs.LO). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), followed by cs.LO (Logic). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of tools and (industrial) applications, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges faced by the unified SC-square community, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
