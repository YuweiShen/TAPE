The paper also investigates the theoretical and empirical power of the extended ASP tableaux, which involves studying the relationship with extended resolution proof system (cs.LO), giving a polynomial-length proof for a family of normal logic programs (cs.PL), and investigating the effect of program simplification on the lengths of proofs in ASP (cs.DS). The paper also empirically investigates the effect of redundant rules on the efficiency of ASP solving (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
