This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the complexity of decoding, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) and pairing of subchannels suggests a possible connection to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
