This involves the use of signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The paper also proposes a prototype system of empathetic robots called Zara the Supergirl. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Robotics (cs.RO), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
