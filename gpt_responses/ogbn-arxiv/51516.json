The presence of an attacker and the need to consider observability in a new sense suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. The use of automata and product automata in the paper suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages) categories.
