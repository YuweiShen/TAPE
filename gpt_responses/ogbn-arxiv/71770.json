Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of information processing, transmission, and storage. The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which makes cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely category. The paper also involves signal processing, which makes cs.SI (Signal Processing) another possible category. The paper also involves optimization techniques, which makes cs.MM (Mathematical Optimization) another possible category. Finally, the paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
