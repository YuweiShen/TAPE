It may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it discusses the performance of MIMO systems employing OFDM and BICM. The paper also proposes a new algorithm for MIMO detection, which could fall under the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of lattice decoding and channel orthogonalization process may also make it relevant to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the proposed algorithm in wireless communication systems, which could make it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
