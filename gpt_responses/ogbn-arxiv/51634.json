The techniques used in the paper involve convex relaxations and nuclear norm regularization, which are common in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and scientific computing (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
