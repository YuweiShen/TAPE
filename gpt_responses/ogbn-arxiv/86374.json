The approach taken in the paper involves using the sum-of-squares method to extend results from exact matrix completion to the tensor setting. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
