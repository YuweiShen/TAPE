The paper proposes a new NLG model based on hierarchical decoding with linguistic patterns, which involves machine learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, falling under the category of machine learning (LG). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
