The paper also discusses the human visual system and how it processes visual information, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of saliency maps and gradient information suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT) in the proposed approach. Finally, the use of objective scores and the comparison with subjective scores indicates the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the evaluation of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
