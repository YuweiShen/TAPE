This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the mention of the Eiffel method suggests that Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Object-Oriented Programming (cs.OO) sub-categories are also likely. The paper also discusses practical topics, which suggests that Software Development (cs.SD) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories are also possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
