This falls under the domain of Computer Vision (cs.CV) as it involves image processing and pattern recognition. The use of MLP also suggests that it falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) which is a common application of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IR, cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
