The paper proposes a new approach for optimizing the shape of the ambiguity sets for RMDPs. This involves computing a weight parameter from the value functions, which then drives the shape of the ambiguity sets. The paper falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with reinforcement learning. It also involves optimization (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) as it deals with MDPs. Finally, it involves data structures (cs.DS) as it involves computing weights from value functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
