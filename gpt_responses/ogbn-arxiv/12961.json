This involves training a Bayesian neural network using variational inference to model the environment dynamics and updating the agent's policy accordingly. This work is primarily focused on improving exploration in RL, which is a core problem in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves experiments with continuous control and sparse reward environments, which suggests a possible connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
