The algorithms also exploit game structure through fast computation of the Jacobian of the payoff function, which involves techniques from optimization and numerical analysis (cs.DS). The paper also presents experimental results, which suggests that the algorithms may involve machine learning or statistical analysis (cs.LG) and may have practical applications in real-world scenarios (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
