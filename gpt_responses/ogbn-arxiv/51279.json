It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes an alternative approach to the current state-of-the-art machine translation systems. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well. The paper also involves the use of attention-like properties, which could make it relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
