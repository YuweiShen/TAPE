The construction of explicit faithful maps for polynomials also involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper may also be relevant to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and scientific computing (cs.SC) due to the use of mathematical criteria and constructions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
