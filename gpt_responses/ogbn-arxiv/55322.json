The use of Noise2Noise and Noise2Void training schemes also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the application of these methods to biomedical image data, which could fall under the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning for image processing could also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
