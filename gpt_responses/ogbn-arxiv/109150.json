The use of tensor networks is a common technique in quantum information theory (cs.QI), but it is also increasingly used in classical information theory, including for the study of error-correcting codes (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the complexity of the decoding algorithm, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and the use of numerical simulations, which is a topic in scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the codes on different types of channels, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
