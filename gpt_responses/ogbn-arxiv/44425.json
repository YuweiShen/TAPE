The paper specifically focuses on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language models composed of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, which are commonly used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of external memory in LSTM models, which is a topic related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely categories. \n\nThe paper's approach involves attending to information in memory, which is a technique used in neural networks for various tasks, including computer vision. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision) is a possible category as well. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on LSTM models and their limitations suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
