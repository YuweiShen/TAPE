The setup involves two encoders, which suggests a focus on distributed source coding (cs.MM). The sources are discrete and memoryless, which is a common assumption in information theory and signal processing (cs.SI). The distortion measures are bounded, which is a constraint that can be relevant in many areas of computer science, such as optimization and control (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a computable outer bound, which is a result that can be of interest to researchers in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
