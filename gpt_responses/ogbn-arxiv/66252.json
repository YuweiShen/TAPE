The use of LSTM and Bi-LSTM models for learning temporal dynamics suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve the use of RGB-D images, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed framework in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC), which are commonly used in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
