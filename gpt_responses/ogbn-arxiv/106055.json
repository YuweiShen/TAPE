The paper deals with modeling the data generated by this system. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The cognitive radio network can be seen as a complex system that needs to be controlled and optimized, and the paper deals with analyzing the data generated by this system to improve its performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
