The paper also proposes new baselines using convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based neural models, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the problem of evaluating randomized models, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) and proposes a statistically grounded methodology. Finally, the paper introduces a unified open-source software framework, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
