The proposed method is applied to image classification tasks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR). The paper also mentions the use of FPGA for hardware implementation, which is a common topic in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
