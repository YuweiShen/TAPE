This involves analyzing the information content of the received signals and extracting relevant parameters such as excess delay and relative Doppler frequency. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the dynamic propagation process in vehicular communication scenarios, which is a key aspect of wireless networking. The findings can be used to improve the design and performance of vehicular communication systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves tracking methods for channel sounder measurements, which can be seen as a control problem. The goal is to accurately estimate the parameters of the multipath propagation model in real-time. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wideband analysis of multipath propagation, which is relevant for multimedia applications such as video streaming and real-time communication. The quality of these applications depends on the ability to maintain a stable and high-bandwidth connection in dynamic environments. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper involves multiple agents (i.e., the individual MPCs) interacting in a complex environment (i.e., the vehicular communication scenario). The statistical models can be seen as a way to understand and predict the behavior of these agents, which is relevant for designing"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
