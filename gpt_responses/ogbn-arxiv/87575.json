The paper also involves algorithms and computational complexity (cs.DS), as it develops efficient algorithms for constructing mechanisms. The topic of risk aversion is closely related to decision making under uncertainty, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses revenue maximization, which is a common objective in mechanism design and falls under the category of computational economics (cs.EC). Lastly, the paper involves analyzing the feasibility of LPs, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
