It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the application mentioned is household robotics. Additionally, the paper proposes a modification to existing object detectors using machine learning techniques, which suggests it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as it mentions the need for fast runtime, which is often a concern in security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
