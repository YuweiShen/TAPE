This involves applying machine learning techniques to financial data, which falls under the category of computational finance. The paper also discusses the use of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, which are commonly used in natural language processing and time series analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper involves data structuring and feature selection, which are related to database systems (cs.CE) and data science (cs.DS), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
