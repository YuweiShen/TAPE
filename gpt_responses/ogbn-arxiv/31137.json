The use of contextualized word embeddings is a recent development in NLP, and the paper specifically focuses on their application to dialogue evaluation. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as learning-based metrics, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another likely sub-category. The use of embeddings and machine learning also suggests cs.LG (Learning) as a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the evaluation of dialogue systems, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
