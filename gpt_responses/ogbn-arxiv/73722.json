The paper also discusses the ability of neural networks to acquire syntax, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments involve training RNNs, which is a type of neural network, and thus could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper uses a synthetic approach to study the impact of typological properties on RNNs, which could be considered under cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
