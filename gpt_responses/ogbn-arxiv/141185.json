The approach involves leveraging context information to improve localization, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on the PASCAL VOC dataset, which is a standard benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
