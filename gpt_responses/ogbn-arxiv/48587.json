The paper also involves the analysis of the sample complexity and computational complexity of the algorithm, which is related to the field of information theory (cs.IT). The algorithmic techniques used in the paper involve the sum-of-squares method, which is a popular tool in theoretical computer science for solving optimization problems, and is related to the field of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves the analysis of the anti-concentration property of the inlier distribution, which is related to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
