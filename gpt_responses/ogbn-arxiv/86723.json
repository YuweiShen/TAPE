The focus of the paper is on the rate of convergence of the smallest attainable expected distortion to its asymptotic value, which is a topic of interest in information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also discusses the problem of transmitting i.i.d uniform bits over a binary symmetric channel, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses techniques from probability theory and analysis, which are relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
