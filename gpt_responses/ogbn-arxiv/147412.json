This involves analyzing partially occluded faces, which is a common problem in computer vision. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper addresses the challenge of social interaction in virtual reality settings, where head-mounted displays occlude facial expressions and restrict social engagement cues. The proposed algorithm aims to overcome this challenge by generating dynamic avatars that function as an expressive surrogate for the user. \n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves generating dynamic avatars in real-time, which requires graphics processing. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves analyzing images and videos to infer facial expressions, which is a common task in multimedia analysis. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a novel approach for increasing CNN accuracy via personalization, which could be relevant to robotics applications that involve personalized interaction with humans."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
