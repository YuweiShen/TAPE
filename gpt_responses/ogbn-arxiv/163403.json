The use of RGB cameras for marker detection is also mentioned, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method involves the fusion of pose estimates with inertial measurements, which is a common technique in robotics and control systems (cs.SY). The use of an extended Kalman filter for noise reduction is a common technique in machine learning and control systems (cs.AI, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
