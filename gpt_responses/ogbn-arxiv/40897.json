This falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of polymorphisms also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the study of logical reasoning (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) for solving CSPs, which further supports these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
