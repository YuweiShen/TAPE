The use of coded redundancy to achieve similar computational cost as the original method when all machines are present suggests that the paper may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. The evaluation of the proposed technique on matrix-vector multiplication and linear regression tasks suggests that it may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The adaptive nature of the proposed technique suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the use of cloud computing resources suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
