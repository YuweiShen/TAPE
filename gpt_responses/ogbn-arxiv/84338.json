The use of extended causal models also suggests a potential application in AI for modeling complex systems. \n\n2. cs.LG: Learning causal models is an important topic in machine learning, and the paper's focus on actual causation using extended causal models could be relevant to this sub-category. \n\n3. cs.CE: Causal models are also used in computational epidemiology to understand the spread of diseases and other health-related issues. The paper's focus on normality could be relevant to this sub-category, as normality is often used to define disease outbreaks. \n\n4. cs.CR: The paper's focus on causal models could be relevant to the sub-category of computer security, where causal relationships between events can be used to identify and prevent cyber attacks. \n\n5. cs.SI: The paper's focus on extended causal models and their potential complexity could be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks, where causal relationships between individuals and groups can be used to understand and predict behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
