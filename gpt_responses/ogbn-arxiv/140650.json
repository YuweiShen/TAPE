The proposed MemNet introduces a memory block to explicitly mine persistent memory, which involves learning and adapting to the current state, and hence, it can also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The recursive unit in MemNet learns multi-level representations of the current state under different receptive fields, which involves optimization and tuning of the network parameters, and hence, it can also be categorized under neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper applies MemNet to three image restoration tasks, which involves processing and manipulating images, and hence, it can also be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
