The paper also deals with image classification datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV). The algorithm proposed in the paper involves traversing the space of neural activation over a representation layer, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for feature extraction. The paper also mentions coreset dataset compression ideas, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with sample complexity, which is a concept commonly studied in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
