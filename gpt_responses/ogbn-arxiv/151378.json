It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these fields heavily rely on neural networks and face similar challenges with adversarial examples. Additionally, since the paper proposes a formal verification technique, it could also be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
