This makes it particularly relevant to computer vision tasks, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely arXiv CS sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of deep supervision and batch normalization, which are common techniques in machine learning, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The use of circular harmonics to achieve equivariance is a novel approach, which could make this paper relevant to researchers in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper presents state-of-the-art results on the rotated-MNIST dataset, which is a benchmark challenge in computer vision, suggesting that cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
