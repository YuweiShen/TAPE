However, the most relevant ones are likely to be Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a novel algorithmic framework for sequential decision-making in wireless-network optimisation problems, which involves online convex optimisation in a bandit setting. This approach is motivated by the need to deal with non-stationary and partially observable environments, which are common in wireless networks. Therefore, the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers working in the above-mentioned sub-disciplines, who are interested in developing new methods for wireless-network optimisation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
