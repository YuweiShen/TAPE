The use of Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions suggests optimization techniques, which are also relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and neural networks (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of singular values, which are commonly used in matrix manipulation and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides a closed-form expression for the capacity under certain conditions, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
