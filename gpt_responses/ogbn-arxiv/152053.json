This topic is closely related to computer networks (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also proposes a method for predicting service performance based on a VNF profile, which involves system modeling and control (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of network functions using software (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
