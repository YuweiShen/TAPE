It could also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because plagiarism detection involves searching for similar documents. Machine Learning (cs.LG) is another likely sub-category because the proposed model involves combining multiple methods to improve performance. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also possible because the problem of detecting paraphrase plagiarism requires intelligent algorithms. Finally, Cybersecurity (cs.CY) is a less likely sub-category, but still possible because plagiarism detection is important for maintaining the integrity of academic and professional work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
