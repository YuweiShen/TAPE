The paper discusses the use of bilevel optimization, which is a technique commonly used in optimization problems in machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of regularization, which is a common technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
