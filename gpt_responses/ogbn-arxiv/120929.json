Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. However, it also draws connections between algebra and computational effects, which suggests that it could also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) or Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of algebraic effects and handlers, which could place it in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses mathematical notation and models, which could also make it relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
