The paper focuses on the application of these controllers to multirotor Unmanned Aerial Systems, which falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO). The use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and disturbance estimation also involves the use of optimization and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of computer vision techniques for outdoor flight tests, which falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of system identification and control theory, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
