The paper also introduces a new technique for analyzing the sample complexity of families of predictors, which involves developing a new notion of randomized approximate description of functions. This technique is related to information theory (cs.IT) and could potentially be applied to other areas of machine learning beyond neural networks. Additionally, the paper discusses the composition of linear function classes and non-linear functions, which is a topic in neural network architecture (cs.NE) and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's results on sub-linear sample complexity bounds could be relevant to the study of efficient algorithms and computational complexity (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
