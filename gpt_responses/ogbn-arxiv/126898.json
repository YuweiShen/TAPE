This involves the use of an RGB-D camera to recognize the pointing gestures performed by the users and locate the target of pointing on a common workspace. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also involves computer vision techniques for gesture recognition, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another likely sub-category. The use of robotics and automation in the system can also make cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques for gesture recognition, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques for providing suitable output modalities, which makes cs.CL (Computation and Language) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
