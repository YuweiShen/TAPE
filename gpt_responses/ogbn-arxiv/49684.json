The methodology also involves training the system to learn on-road characteristics, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the predictive drive system is for autonomous driving vehicles, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
