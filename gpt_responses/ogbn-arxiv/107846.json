The authors propose a deep learning-based approach, which involves training a modified U-Net architecture, and optimizing it using a loss function that combines binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
