It also discusses representations for classes of functions that can be feasibly integrated and maximized, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of second-order complexity theory for operators in analysis, which falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SC) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
