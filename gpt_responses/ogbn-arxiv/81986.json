Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also introduces a new family of priors and leverages invertible networks, which could potentially fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SD (Sound). However, since these aspects are not the main focus of the paper, they are less likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
