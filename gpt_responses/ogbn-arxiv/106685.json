The use of network codes and transmission schedules also suggests a possible fit in the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses lossless and lossy networks, which could be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SI) sub-category. The study of convergence of dense codes to the min-cut capacity of line networks could also be related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
