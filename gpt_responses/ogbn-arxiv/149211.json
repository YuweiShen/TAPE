The proposed method uses a cost function that takes into account state estimation errors and cardinality estimation errors, which are concepts commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of a filter, which is a common tool in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
