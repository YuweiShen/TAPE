This approach combines techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), making it likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses transfer learning from pre-trained models, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
