The paper also discusses the decoupling principle in iterative multiuser detection algorithms, which is a topic related to statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper analyzes the performance of specific iterative detectors, such as ORC-PIC and BP-based detector, which are topics related to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
