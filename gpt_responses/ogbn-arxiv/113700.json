The layer is designed to reduce space-time complexity, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of trainable pointwise convolutions, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
