It also involves the characterization of the problem as a linear program with constraints, which is a common technique in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of polymatroidal structure is a technique often used in optimization and algorithms (cs.DS), and the paper also discusses the trade-off between active and inactive users, which is a topic in network science and optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the related source coding problem, which is a topic in multimedia and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
