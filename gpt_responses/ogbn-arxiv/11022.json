The proposed frameworks involve learning embeddings and synthesizing parameters for novel unseen classes, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses semantic representations and metrics used in generalized zero-shot learning, which are topics in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
