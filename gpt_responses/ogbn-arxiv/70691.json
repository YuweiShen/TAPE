This falls under the scope of social and information networks research.\n\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a technique for identifying relevant tweets based on matching keywords and hashtags. This involves natural language processing and falls under the scope of computation and language research.\n\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the task of retrieving relevant tweets from a large corpus of data. This falls under the scope of information retrieval research.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of social media data for disaster response and management, which has implications for society. This falls under the scope of computers and society research.\n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the primary focus of the paper, the use of social media data for disaster response and management has implications for security and privacy.
