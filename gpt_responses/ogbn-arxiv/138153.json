This involves using deep learning for regression tasks and improving scores on Atari games with delayed rewards. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning). The paper also involves optimization and decision-making, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.GT (Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
