The paper also discusses the use of automatic norm reward systems, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the transfer of learning by abstracting policies, which is a topic in both machine learning and robotics. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of their approach in cognitive science, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CYBER)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
