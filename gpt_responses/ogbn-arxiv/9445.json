The proposed approach involves the use of a sparse model, which is also relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also introduces a novel fusion function, which could be considered a contribution to the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
