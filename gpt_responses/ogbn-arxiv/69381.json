The most relevant sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), which deals with audio and speech processing. The paper also uses machine learning techniques, which are covered in cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of neural networks falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with probabilistic loss functions, which could also be relevant to cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
