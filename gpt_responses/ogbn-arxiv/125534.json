The paper also discusses the use of ResNet-50 as a backbone, which is a popular deep learning architecture used in image classification and object detection tasks (cs.LG). The proposed framework involves classification and regression subnetworks, which are common techniques used in machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of benchmarks like GOT-10K and LaSOT, which are commonly used in robotics and computer vision research (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the real-time speed of the proposed framework, which is a common concern in multimedia research (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
