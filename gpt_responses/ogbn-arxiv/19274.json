The paper also mentions the use of a formal proof/argument theory, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of this learning concept to percepts received by an agent, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the need for the integration of automated reasoners and high-expressivity planners with statistical/connectionist ML technology, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
