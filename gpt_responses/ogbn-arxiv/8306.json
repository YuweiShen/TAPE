Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves analyzing and leveraging useful properties, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
