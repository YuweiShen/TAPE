The proposed method involves normalization, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep convolutional neural networks also suggests the neural networks (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on the COCO dataset, which is commonly used for object detection and segmentation tasks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
