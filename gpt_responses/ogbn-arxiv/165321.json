The approach involves using deep sub-networks to learn features from facial patches, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes data augmentation techniques for generating more facial expression data, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach is evaluated on three FER datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
