The use of a novel network structure and training approach also suggests a potential contribution to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the approach on both synthetic and real examples suggests a potential application in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
