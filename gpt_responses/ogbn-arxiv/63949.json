The proposed method leverages natural language descriptions to train the deep model, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of deep learning and neural networks is a key aspect of the proposed method, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval, as it aims to extract structured information from images and natural language descriptions (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
