The paper also mentions Simulink, which is a widely used tool for modeling and simulating control systems. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses a process for verifying software, specifically fault detection software. The process involves transforming a model into code and analyzable annotations, which are key aspects of software engineering. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions autocoding, which is the process of automatically generating code from a model. This is a topic that falls under programming languages research. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper presents a new approach, referred to as the credible autocoding framework, for verifying fault detection software. This could be considered an emerging technology in the field of software engineering. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions using quadratic invariants to express safety and correctness properties of the fault detection software. Invariants are a key concept in logic and formal methods research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
