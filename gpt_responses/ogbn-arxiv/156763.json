This involves using reference keyframes and frame-to-frame optical flow estimates to extract high-detail features and compute features of adjustable quality on the current frame. The paper also discusses the modularity of the update branch, where feature subnetworks of varying layer depth can be inserted, enabling operation over a new, state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off spectrum. Given these details, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
