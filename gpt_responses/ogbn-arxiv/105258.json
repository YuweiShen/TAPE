This involves selecting neighbor nodes with a short block propagation time, which is a key aspect of network communication and falls under the category of computer networks (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper deals with security issues related to blockchain networks, such as the risk of forks, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a simulation-based approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of the proposed method on the overall performance of the blockchain network, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
