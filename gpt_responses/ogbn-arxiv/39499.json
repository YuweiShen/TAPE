The proposed method involves the use of Voronoi-based spatial partitioning, which is a technique commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a popular topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM).
