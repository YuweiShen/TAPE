The proposed augmented nonlinear digital self-interference canceller involves signal processing and system control, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The extensive waveform simulations mentioned in the paper suggest that it may also be related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
