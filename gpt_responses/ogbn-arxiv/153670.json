The paper proposes a novel active sampling scheme within the pair-wise approach to conduct bipartite ranking efficiently. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with ranking and classification, which suggests that it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments on real-world large-scale datasets, which suggests that it could belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
