The method induces solutions in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules, which is a type of rule-based learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.DM (Data Mining)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
