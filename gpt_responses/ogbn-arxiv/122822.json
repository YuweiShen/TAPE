It includes class label information for greedy pretraining of deep belief networks and is defined as a distance over the features for discriminative training of deep neural networks. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new regularization technique for training deep models, which is a core topic in machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new technique for improving the training of deep models, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper focuses on classification tasks, which are often related to computer vision and pattern recognition.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a technique for training deep neural networks, which is a subfield of neural computing.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper includes experiments on text classification, which is a subfield of natural language processing and falls under the computation and language category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
