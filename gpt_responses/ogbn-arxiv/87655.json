The paper focuses on memory addressing schemes and their effects on learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the use of differentiable and non-differentiable read/write mechanisms, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments conducted on Facebook bAbI tasks and sequential pMNIST suggest that the paper could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
