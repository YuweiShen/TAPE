The use of sparsity in the constraints is a common technique in approximation algorithms, which suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a likely category. The paper also deals with submodular optimization, which is a topic in both cs.GT (Game Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The analysis of the integrality gap involves linear programming, which is a topic in cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper deals with hardness of approximation, which is a topic in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
