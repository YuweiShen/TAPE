The most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it deals with natural language processing. The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. The use of semantic features and attention weights suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of large-scale NLI corpora, which could also make cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
