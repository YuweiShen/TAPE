The paper also proposes a new class of models, which involves learning from sampler-induced distributions, which can be applied to various subfields of machine learning such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed models on language modeling tasks, which falls under the subfield of cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
