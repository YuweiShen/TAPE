The paper also proposes a new relation for detecting data races, which is relevant to the PL community. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with concurrent software, which is a key topic in distributed and parallel computing. The paper also proposes a new relation for detecting data races, which is relevant to the DC community. \n3. cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper discusses the challenge of writing reliable concurrent software, which is a key topic in operating systems. The paper also proposes a new relation for detecting data races, which is relevant to the OS community. \n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the challenge of writing reliable software, which is a key topic in software engineering. The paper also proposes a new relation for detecting data races, which is relevant to the SE community. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new relation for detecting data races, which involves algorithmic techniques.
