The approach involves processing raw vibration data using the Hilbert-Huang transform and constructing a novel nonlinear degradation indicator as the label for learning. The use of deep learning and signal processing techniques suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), systems and control (cs.SY), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
