Computer vision techniques are used to extract spatial and temporal features from the video sequences. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel framework that uses deep spatio-temporal convolutional autoencoders to learn features from normal activities and detect falls as anomalies. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses deep learning techniques to detect falls and presents a new anomaly scoring method to combine the reconstruction score of frames across a video sequence. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the importance of fall detection from a health and safety perspective, which is a key concern in human-computer interaction. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video sequences obtained from non-invasive sensing modalities and proposes a framework to detect falls using deep spatio-temporal convolutional autoencoders."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
