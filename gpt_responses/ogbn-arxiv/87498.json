Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of spatial precoding processing strategies, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also explores the impact of critical network parameters, which can be considered as a system-level analysis and falls under the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of joint multi-node data processing, which can be considered as a machine learning approach and falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper proposes an optimization framework, which can be considered as an artificial intelligence approach and falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
