This involves the use of information theory concepts such as large deviation theory. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a distributed detection scheme and considers the optimization of its parameters. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of constant modulus signaling for distributed detection. This technique is commonly used in multimedia applications such as audio and video processing. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the transmission of signals over a multiple access channel, which is a common problem in networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a detection scheme that can be optimized based on the characteristics of the sensing noise. This involves the use of machine learning techniques to identify the optimal parameters."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
