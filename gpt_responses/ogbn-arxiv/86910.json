Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the decentralized training of neural networks, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper discusses the effects of noise injection on non-linear neural networks, which is a topic in the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the potential benefits of noise injection in improving the generalization ability of the model, which is a topic in the subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
