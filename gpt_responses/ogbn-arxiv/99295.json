The problems involve matrix approximation, coreset construction, and feature selection, which are all topics that fall under the umbrella of Data Science (cs.DS) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents novel algorithms for these problems, which involve numerical computations and optimization techniques, making it relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Additionally, the paper's focus on feature selection and clustering suggests that it may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
