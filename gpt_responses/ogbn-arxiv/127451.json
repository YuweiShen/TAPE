The paper also mentions the connection between information theory and geometry of numbers, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and scientific computing (cs.SI). The use of lattice codes is a common technique in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and the study of lattices is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
