Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the study of optimization problems and graph theory, which are related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) respectively. Moreover, the paper uses techniques from linear algebra and semidefinite programming, which are relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
