The use of millimeter wave communication also suggests a potential connection to the sub-category of computer science focused on millimeter wave technology (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of analog beamforming, which could fall under the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
