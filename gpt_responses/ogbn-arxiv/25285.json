The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques to infer local shape distributions, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of local shape distributions to reconstruct object-scale shape could also place it in the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper's focus on efficient and robust reconstruction of shape could also place it in the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of a quadratic representation of local shape could place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
