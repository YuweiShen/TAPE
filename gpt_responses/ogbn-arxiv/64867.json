This is a core topic in game theory, making cs.GT the most likely category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of mirror descent algorithms and their optimistic variants, which are commonly used in machine learning. The paper also compares the performance of different algorithms experimentally, which is a common practice in machine learning research.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of regret-minimization algorithms for computing Nash equilibria, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence research. The paper also discusses the use of distributed updates and pruning of game trees, which are important techniques in AI.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of distance-generating functions and their properties, which are important concepts in data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses the convergence rate of different algorithms, which is a common topic in algorithm analysis.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of distributed updates and pruning of game trees, which are important topics in systems and control research. The paper also discusses the convergence rate of different algorithms, which is a common topic in control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
