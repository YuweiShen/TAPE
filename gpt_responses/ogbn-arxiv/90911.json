Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also introduces a new data structure called the wavelet stack, which could fall under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves information theory in the analysis of the algorithm, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory).
