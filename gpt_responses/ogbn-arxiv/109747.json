The use of abstention as a strategy for improving prediction performance is a novel approach that may be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning. The paper also discusses regret bounds, which are a common metric used in the analysis of online learning algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
