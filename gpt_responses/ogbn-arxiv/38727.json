The paper proposes a new approach to mitigate pilot contamination by aligning the power-delay profiles (PDP) of different users served by one base station (BS) and different BSs, which can be applied in various CS sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SI, cs.MM, and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
