The use of covariance matrices and Riemannian manifolds suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of discriminative mapping and similarity vectors suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
