Specifically, it focuses on the fusion of multi-modality PET-CT images for detecting and segmenting lung cancer. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves medical imaging (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) as it uses a CNN for feature fusion and image analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
