Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also extensively uses DRL, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper proposes a novel framework for TE, which could also place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
