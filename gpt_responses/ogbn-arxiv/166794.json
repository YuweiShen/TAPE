The use of temporal logic specifications also suggests a connection to the field of programming languages (cs.PL), where temporal logic is often used to specify program behavior. Finally, the use of Markov decision processes (MDPs) suggests a connection to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
