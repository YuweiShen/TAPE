This involves the use of image schema and embodied perception grounding, which are concepts commonly studied in the fields of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of computer vision techniques for analyzing visual imagery (cs.CV) and the potential applications of this work in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
