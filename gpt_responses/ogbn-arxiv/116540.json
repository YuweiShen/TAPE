The proposed algorithms involve iterative promotion of variable step sizes, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of sparse constraints, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SP) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which is a common practice in the field of signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
