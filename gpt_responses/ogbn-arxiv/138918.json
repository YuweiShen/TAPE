The paper also uses separator techniques, which are commonly used in algorithmic graph theory, hence cs.DS is also a likely sub-category. The paper involves approximation algorithms, which are studied in the theoretical computer science community, hence cs.CC is another likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial optimization, which is studied in the discrete mathematics community, hence cs.DM is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves geometric algorithms and optimization, which are studied in the computational geometry and game theory communities, hence cs.GT is another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
