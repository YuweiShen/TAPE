Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of different loss functions and feature learning modules, which could fall under sub-categories such as cs.SD (Sound) and cs.LG (Learning). The paper also mentions the use of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which is commonly used in speech recognition, and could fall under cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
