The problems involve partitioning or orienting edges in graphs, which falls under the sub-categories of Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Graph Theory (cs.GT). The algorithms presented in the paper involve randomized and deterministic rounds, which are related to the sub-category of Networked Systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper also deals with the complexity of the algorithms, which is related to the sub-category of Algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
