It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it specifically deals with neural network training. Additionally, since the paper uses the MNIST dataset, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also involves optimizing the precision of numerical values, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
