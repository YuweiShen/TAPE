The paper also discusses the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in solving the problem, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The concept of spurious local minima is related to optimization (cs.DS), and the paper's focus on theoretical analysis and counterexamples suggests it may also fall under the sub-category of statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
