The use of antenna arrays and physical-layer signatures also involves networking and communication technologies (cs.NI). The system design and implementation involve control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) to detect threats. The paper also discusses the optimization of energy consumption, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
