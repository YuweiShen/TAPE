The paper discusses the use of eigenvalue spectra analysis to evaluate the convergence of training and the convergence of the chaotic activity of the reservoir toward stable states. This topic falls under the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a methodology to break the closed loop system and incorporate feedback effects. The paper also discusses the use of least squares regression, which falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
