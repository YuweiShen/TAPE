Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses hyperparameter tuning and regularisation methods, which are common topics in machine learning and deep learning research, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of large-scale automatic black-box hyperparameter tuning, which could fall under the category of neural networks and computational neuroscience (cs.NE). Finally, the paper establishes a new state of the art on the Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2 corpora, which are commonly used in NLP research, and could also fall under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV) due to the use of language models for image captioning and other tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
