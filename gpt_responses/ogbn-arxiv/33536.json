The use of deep learning models for medical imaging is also a popular research area in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a detector to localize the lesions, which is a common technique in object detection (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the availability of source code and models, which suggests a focus on practical applications (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
