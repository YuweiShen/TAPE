This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Databases (cs.DB). Given that the paper focuses on improving the performance of neural ranking techniques, which are commonly used in Information Retrieval and Machine Learning, it is most likely to belong to the cs.IR sub-category. However, the paper also discusses the use of embeddings and knowledge graphs, which are relevant to several other sub-categories, such as cs.CL, cs.AI, and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
