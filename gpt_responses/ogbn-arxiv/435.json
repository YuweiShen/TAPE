This makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) the most likely sub-category, as it specifically deals with the modeling, analysis, and control of such systems. The paper also discusses mathematical models and their approximations, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.PL (Programming Languages).
