The use of a novel second order optimal minimum energy filter and a generalized Charbonnier energy function suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the joint estimation of camera motion and disparity map implies that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
