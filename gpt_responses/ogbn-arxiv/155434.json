This suggests that the paper may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the development of a deep learning model for objective VQA, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also collects subjective quality scores and human behavior data from subjects, indicating a potential fit for the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves data mining and analysis, which could fall under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
