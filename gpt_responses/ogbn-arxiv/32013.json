The use of restricted isometry property and mutual coherence also suggests a connection to compressed sensing, which is a subfield of both information theory and signal processing. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.SP are the most likely categories, followed by cs.LG, cs.NA, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
