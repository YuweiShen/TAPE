The paper proposes null models to understand the impact of nodal spatiotemporal dynamics on spreading potential, which involves statistical analysis and modeling. The paper also discusses the implications of the findings for communicable diseases and information dissemination, which are relevant to social and information sciences. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (social and information networks), cs.SD (systems and control), and cs.SY (systems and control). Additionally, the paper also involves aspects of computational epidemiology and network science, which are relevant to cs.SOC (social and economic systems) and cs.CE (computational engineering, finance, and science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
