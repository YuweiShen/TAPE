This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically involves neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the procedure is for pattern recognition, which is often associated with computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the use of ensembles is a common technique in machine learning, which could also place this paper in the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
