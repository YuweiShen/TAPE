This is a problem that falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the effect of noise on the recovery results, which is a topic that falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical theory (cs.ST). Additionally, the paper presents simple reconstruction algorithms and discusses their accuracy, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
