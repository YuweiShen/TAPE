This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) also suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) domains, where GCNs have been applied successfully. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for estimating confidence scores in GCNs, which could be of interest to researchers working on uncertainty estimation in machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
