Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the network design process, which involves machine-driven design exploration, suggesting that it could also fit into the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions achieving high inference speed, which could place it in the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the suitability of the proposed network for low-power edge scenarios, which could place it in the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
