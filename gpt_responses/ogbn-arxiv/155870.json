The paper also introduces a new model of congestion games that captures several extensions of the standard model. Therefore, the paper is likely to be classified under cs.GT (Game Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
