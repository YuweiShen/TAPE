The paper also presents a framework for quantifying chemical memory, which involves data storage and retrieval, and could be considered a database (cs.DB) topic. The experimental demonstration of kilobyte-scale information storage involves algorithms and complexity (cs.CC), and the discussion of practical constraints on total capacity could be considered a cryptography and security (cs.CR) topic. Finally, the exploration of new perspectives necessary to harness the information capacity available from non-genomic chemical space could involve machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
