However, since the paper focuses on text classification, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LG and cs.IR. The use of deep learning techniques also makes cs.AI a likely sub-category, while the potential application of the proposed approach to image classification makes cs.CV a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
