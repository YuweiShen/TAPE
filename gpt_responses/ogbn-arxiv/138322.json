This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes new methods of data augmentation, which could also place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of different criteria for building the ensemble of deep learning methods could also suggest a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in combination with CNNs could suggest a potential fit for the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
