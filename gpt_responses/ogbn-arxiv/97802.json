The paper proposes a calibration method to improve recognition performance for tail classes, which involves adjusting the prediction of the classification head. This calibration method is based on statistical techniques and machine learning, which are common in the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as benchmarking and evaluation, which are relevant to the subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and potential security implications of the proposed method, which are relevant to the subfield of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
