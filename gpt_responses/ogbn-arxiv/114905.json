This suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Systems and Control (cs.SD), or Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The focus on constructions of APN functions, bent functions, semi-bent functions, planar functions, and permutation polynomials further supports the relevance of these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
