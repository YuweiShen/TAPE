The use of lists instead of single messages is a novel twist, which could also place the paper in the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also examines the fundamental limits of the setup, which could place it in the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides necessary and/or sufficient conditions for asymptotically error-free communication, which could place it in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
