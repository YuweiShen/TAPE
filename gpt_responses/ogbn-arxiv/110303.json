The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based method for the secondary user to adjust its transmit power, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of sensor nodes to collect information about the wireless environment, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of non-cooperative behavior between the primary and secondary users, which can be considered as a control systems problem (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
