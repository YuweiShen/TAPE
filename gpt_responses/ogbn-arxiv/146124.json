It may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as the authors mention the high nonlinearities and algebraic degrees of the resulted permutations. Additionally, it may fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the design of cryptographic systems involves control and management of information flow. It could also be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as the authors discuss the complexity of the permutations. Finally, it may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the authors present new constructions of permutations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
