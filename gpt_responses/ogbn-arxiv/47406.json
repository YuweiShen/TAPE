The paper shows that several fundamental problems are truly-subquadratic equivalent to $\\textsf{OV}$, including problems related to inner products, closest/furthest pairs, and data structures. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
