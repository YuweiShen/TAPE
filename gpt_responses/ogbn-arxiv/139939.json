The proposed approach involves joint estimation of biases and vehicle positions, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and system theory (cs.SY). The use of digital maps and multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach also involves networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
