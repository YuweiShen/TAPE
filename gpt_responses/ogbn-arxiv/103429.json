The method also involves optimization and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of hash codes for image search, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel bit-flipping procedure for solving the binary quadratic program, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
