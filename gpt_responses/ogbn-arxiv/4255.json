The use of deep learning models for regression tasks also suggests that it could belong to machine learning (cs.MM) and machine learning theory (cs.LG). The approach is purely data-driven, indicating that it could also belong to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on various image databases, suggesting that it could also belong to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
