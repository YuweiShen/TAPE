The network is designed to learn fixed-length representations for variable-length face videos, which involves modeling a face video as a point on a Riemannian manifold and mapping it into high-dimensional space. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
