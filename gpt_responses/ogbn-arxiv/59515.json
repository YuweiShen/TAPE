The use of activation function coresets is a novel approach to model compression, which involves pruning neurons from the network. This makes it relevant to sub-categories such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also involves the construction of data-independent coresets, which is a topic that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
