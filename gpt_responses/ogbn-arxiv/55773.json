The paper specifically focuses on incorporating more flexible and realistic models for the annotation process, which is an important part of the data collection process. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Statistics (cs.ST), and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), as these sub-categories are most relevant to the problem addressed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
