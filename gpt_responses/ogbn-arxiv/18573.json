However, given the focus on signal processing and communication theory, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely categories. The paper also deals with performance analysis and optimization, which could place it under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the use of closed-form approximations and theoretical bounds suggests a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
