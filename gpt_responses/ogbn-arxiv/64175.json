The paper proposes a new architecture called \"PT-Spike\" that uses precise single-spike temporal encoding, efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding to improve the energy efficiency and data processing capability of the time-based SNN. This work is closely related to the field of neural computing and is likely to be classified under cs.NE.\n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper discusses the use of ANNs, such as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications and the challenges associated with their applicability in resource-limited platforms.
