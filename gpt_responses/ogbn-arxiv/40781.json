The paper also mentions the use of routines developed specifically for this purpose, which suggests a computational approach. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DL (Digital Libraries) which deals with the organization, retrieval, and distribution of digital information. The paper also analyzes citation patterns, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, the use of visualization techniques to represent citation impacts could be related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CY (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
