The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable deep MIL framework, which involves training a neural network to classify multiple instances within an image, making it likely to fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) subcategories. The paper also deals with zero-shot learning, which involves learning from unseen data, making it relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
