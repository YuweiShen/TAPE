Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of interference on the MAC layer throughput, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of large antenna arrays for beamforming, which is a key feature of mmWave networks and falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the need for adaptive resource allocation and interference management strategies, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the collision probability and throughput of mmWave networks, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
