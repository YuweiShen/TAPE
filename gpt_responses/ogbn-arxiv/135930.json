The paper also mentions additively decomposable problems, which fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, which falls under the category of control systems and robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
