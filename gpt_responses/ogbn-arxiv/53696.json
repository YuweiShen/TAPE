Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of various program analysis techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance and compatibility properties of sanitizers, which could place it in cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper provides a systematic overview of sanitizers, which could also place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
