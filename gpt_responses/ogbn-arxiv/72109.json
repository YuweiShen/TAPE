The paper also discusses the challenges of scaling object detection to large numbers of classes, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of hierarchies, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses logo recognition, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.CL) as logos often contain text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
