The use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and numerical solvers suggests a focus on control theory and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques to detect road agents, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The optimization of the cost function and constraints to maximize clearance can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
