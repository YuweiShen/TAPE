Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses optimization algorithms and metaheuristics, which fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for video summarization, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
