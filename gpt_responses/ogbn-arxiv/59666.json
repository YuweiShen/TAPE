The method uses a distance metric between states as a replacement for rewards and introduces a goal-distance gradient for policy improvement. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV) as it addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning that is relevant to a wide range of applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
