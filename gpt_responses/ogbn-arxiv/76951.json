The use of causal feedback and resource allocation algorithms also suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper may also touch on communication complexity (cs.CC) as it deals with the limitations of block coding models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
