The mention of the \"Costa Conjecture\" suggests that the paper may also be related to network information theory (cs.NI) and interference management (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on reliable decoding and minimum mean-square error suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
