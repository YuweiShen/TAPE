The authors also mention the use of machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine, which are commonly used in deep learning (cs.DL) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of different features and domains of documents on the performance, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
