The problem of RMQs is a classic problem in data structures, making cs.DS the most likely category. The paper also introduces a new problem, RT2Q, which involves encoding and querying information, making cs.IT a likely category as well. The paper also involves some combinatorial and geometric arguments, which could place it in cs.CC and cs.CG, respectively. Finally, the paper involves analyzing the entropy of RT2Q, which could place it in cs.DM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
