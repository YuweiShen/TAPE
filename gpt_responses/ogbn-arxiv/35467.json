The paper also mentions the use of word embeddings, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses an evolutionary approach to language change, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also touches on issues in recent approaches to studying semantic change, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
