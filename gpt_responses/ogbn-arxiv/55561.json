The authors also collect TCP variables from the server network stack, indicating a strong networking component. \n\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with video streaming, which is a multimedia application. The authors analyze issues such as buffering delays and dropped frames at the client, which are common multimedia problems. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The video streaming service likely uses distributed systems and parallel processing to deliver video content to users. The authors instrument both the CDN server and the client player, indicating a distributed computing component. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper involves analyzing the performance of a complex system (the video streaming service) and identifying issues that affect its behavior. The authors also propose solutions to some of the problems they uncover, indicating a control component. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - While not a primary focus of the paper, the authors do mention security concerns related to the use of HTTPS for video streaming. Additionally, the use of encryption and authentication protocols in the video streaming service could fall under this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
