This topic falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (NLP) and specifically, the area of MRC. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses pre-trained language models and multi-task learning, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with finding relevant knowledge from external sources. Finally, the paper uses neural networks, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
