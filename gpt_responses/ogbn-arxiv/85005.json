The method involves pruning feature maps and kernels, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the method, which could fall under the category of computer systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
