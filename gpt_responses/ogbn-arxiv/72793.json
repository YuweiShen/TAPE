The paper discusses the lack of expressiveness, quantitative features, and robustness in LTL and proposes combining Linear Dynamic Logic, Prompt-LTL, and robust LTL to address these issues. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
