The paper also proposes a novel attention mechanism and uses multi-task learning, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its method on multiple benchmark datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses a fusion strategy to produce the final saliency map, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
