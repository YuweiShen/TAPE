Computer vision (cs.CV) is also used to construct a model of plant stem stiffening and motion dynamics. The use of machine learning to create a holistic plant model and evolve robot controllers suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves the merging of natural organisms with technology, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
