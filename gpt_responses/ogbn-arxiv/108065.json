Information theory is closely related to the design of communication systems, and the paper presents an optimization problem to minimize the pairwise error probability (PEP) of the users under an individual power or sum power constraint, respectively. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a beamforming scheme for multi-user massive MIMO systems, which is a key technology for future wireless networks. The paper also discusses the design of the pre-beamforming matrix and the linear precoding matrix using partial or even no channel state information (CSI), which are important issues in wireless networking. \n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an optimization problem to minimize the pairwise error probability (PEP) of the users under an individual power or sum power constraint, respectively. This is a typical problem in control theory, and the paper presents a semi-definite relaxing (SDR) method and an efficient iterative successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve the problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a beamforming scheme for multi-user massive MIMO systems, which is a key technology for future multimedia applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
