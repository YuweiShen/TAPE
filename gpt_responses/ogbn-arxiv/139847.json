The paper also discusses practical defenses that can be deployed at the firewall level, which falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The attacks described in the paper require knowledge of the sequence numbers of both client and server in a TCP connection, which involves systems and control theory (cs.SY) concepts. Finally, the paper discusses the exploitation of a side channel, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
