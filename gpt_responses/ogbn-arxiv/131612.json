The paper also uses mathematical models to approximate the dynamics of the contagion process, which falls under the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and mathematical modeling (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper discusses the effects of network evolution on the contagion process, which falls under the sub-category of computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
