Additionally, the paper uses ResNet models for experiments, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. The paper also mentions the ImageNet dataset, which is a popular dataset for computer vision tasks. Therefore, cs.CV and cs.AI (artificial intelligence) are also likely categories. The paper also discusses the potential for faster processing speed, decreased memory cost, and higher energy efficiency, which are relevant to computer architecture (cs.AR) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) categories. Finally, the paper mentions the quantization of the Momentum optimizer, which is a common optimization algorithm used in neural networks, making cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) another likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
