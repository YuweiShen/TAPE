It also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The use of stereo reconstruction and multi-view consistency could place it in the robotics (cs.RO) category. The paper also involves data-driven regularization, which could suggest it belongs to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the evaluation on a large dataset could suggest it belongs to the graphics (cs.GR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
