The use of Branch and Bound algorithms is also common in computational geometry (cs.CG) and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the use of concave relaxations and objective function linearization suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
