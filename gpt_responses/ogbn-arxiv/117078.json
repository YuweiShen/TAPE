The proposed method involves using a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model, and using optical flow estimation for map registration, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The system also involves data association and alignment, which can be considered as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) tasks. Finally, the system is designed to improve the effectiveness of robotic systems applied to precision agriculture, which can be considered as a control and optimization problem (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
