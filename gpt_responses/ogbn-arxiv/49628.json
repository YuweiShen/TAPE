The focus is on device-to-device (D2D) communications, which are typically studied in the computer networks and communications (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of ambient backscattering technology, which involves reflecting existing RF signals in the air to communicate, and this falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also introduces analytical models to characterize the impacts of environment factors on the communication performance, which is related to the machine learning (cs.MA) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed hybrid D2D communication paradigm in wireless-powered multimedia communications, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.MA, cs.SY, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
