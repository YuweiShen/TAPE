The proposed scheme involves user selection and opportunistic transmission, which are common techniques in networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses degrees of freedom (DoF) and scaling laws, which are topics in both information theory and networked systems. The use of MIMO technology and the analysis of computational complexity suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.MM (multimedia) and cs.GT (game theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
