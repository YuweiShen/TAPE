These motifs involve irregular communication patterns and asynchronous updates to shared data structures, which are different from the scientific simulations that dominate high-end parallel systems. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Databases (cs.DB), Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
