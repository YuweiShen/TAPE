Therefore, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\nFirstly, cs.CY (Computers and Society) is a likely category because the paper discusses the motivation behind the development of Eventful, which is to address the decline of local news outlets and the resulting vacuum of accountability for local government and businesses. This is a social issue that intersects with computer science. \n\nSecondly, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is another possible category because the paper describes a crowdsourcing platform that involves both field reporters and remote curators. The platform relies on social networks to recruit and coordinate field reporters, and to provide feedback and approval for the content submitted. \n\nThirdly, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is a relevant category because the paper discusses the design and development of a mobile web app that field reporters use to receive personalized missions, submit content, and receive feedback. The app's usability and user experience are important factors in the success of the platform. \n\nFourthly, cs.MM (Multimedia) is a possible category because the paper mentions that field reporters are tasked with taking photos and videos, which are then curated and mashed up by writers to produce a news report.
