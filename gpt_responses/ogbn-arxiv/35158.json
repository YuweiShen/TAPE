The paper proposes a new framework for object detection that does not rely on predefined anchors, which is a common technique used in many object detection methods. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories. The paper also discusses the use of feature pyramid representations, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness and generalization ability of the proposed method, which suggests that it may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
