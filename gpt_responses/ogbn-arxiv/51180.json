The paper also introduces a new basic component and proposes optimization and learning methods, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the practical speed of the proposed network architecture, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also mentions the limited capacity of neural networks, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
