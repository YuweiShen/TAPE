The use of cosine similarity suggests that the paper may be related to natural language processing (cs.CL) or computer vision (cs.CV). The mention of certificates and probabilistic guarantees suggests that the paper may be related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) or machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of high-dimensional data suggests that the paper may be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
