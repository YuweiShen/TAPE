The paper also introduces a new loss function (SQLoss) to encourage agents to stick to the status quo, which is a topic related to Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of Game Theory (cs.GT) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper proposes a method for working with social dilemma games that have visual input, which is related to Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
