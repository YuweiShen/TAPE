The paper discusses the trade-offs between spectral resolution, quality of the HS volume, and light exposure intensity, and proposes two variants of the FTI imager based on compressed sensing theory. The paper also discusses the reconstruction of HS volumes from compressive sensing FTI measurements using an $\\ell_1$-norm minimization problem promoting a 3D sparsity prior. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.OE (Optics), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
