The paper also proposes a novel training procedure for dealing with multiple objectives, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning models in sequential data also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of the Neyman-Pearson classification problem suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
