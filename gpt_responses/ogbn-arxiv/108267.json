This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses data augmentation techniques to deal with a lack of ground-truth training data, which is a common problem in many machine learning applications. This could potentially place the paper in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves extracting detailed information from hyperspectral images. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for classification falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
