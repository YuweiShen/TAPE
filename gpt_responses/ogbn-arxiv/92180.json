Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The problem of recognizing collapsible complexes is also related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM), as well as algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC) in its proof of NP-completeness."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
