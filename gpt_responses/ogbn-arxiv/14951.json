This involves machine learning and computer vision techniques, which are typically covered in the cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.AI sub-categories. The paper also deals with the issue of robustness to outliers, which is a common concern in the field of cybersecurity (cs.CR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC).
