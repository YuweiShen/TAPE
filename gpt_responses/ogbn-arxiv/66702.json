The paper also introduces a new analytical framework for evaluating exploration efficiency, which may fall under the sub-field of robotics (cs.RO) or systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the hardness of MDPs, which is a topic studied in the sub-field of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
