This makes it relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Information Theory (cs.IT). However, given that the paper focuses on the use of transportation cost functions and their impact on the training of Generative Networks, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
