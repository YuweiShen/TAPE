The use of Coulomb's friction law and maximum energy principle suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the contact modeling approach. The experiments involve capturing motion and forces, which suggests the use of computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The evaluation of the models also involves analyzing the limitations and sources of error, which suggests the use of systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves evaluating the effectiveness of the models, which suggests the use of machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
