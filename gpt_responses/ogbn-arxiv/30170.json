The proposed approach involves learning masks to discard corrupted feature elements, which is a machine learning task and could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also involves experiments on synthesized and realistic occluded face datasets, which could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of occlusion in face recognition, which could be categorized under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
