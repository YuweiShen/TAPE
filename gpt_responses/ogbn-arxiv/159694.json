Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an end-to-end learning approach using deep neural networks, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also leverages a light-field camera, which is related to graphics and robotics, and hence cs.GR (Computer Graphics) and cs.RO (Robotics) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
