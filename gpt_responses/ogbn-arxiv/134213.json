Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of 5G technology, which falls under the sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory). The proposed architecture is embedded into the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture and the RAMI4.0 reference architecture, which are related to the sub-categories cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.SE (Software Engineering), respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the requirements and challenges of the industrial use cases, which can be related to the sub-category cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
