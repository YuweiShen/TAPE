The use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its efficiency in tracking true solutions of regression problems is a common technique in data science (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The application of the SGD algorithm to the PEGE linear bandit algorithm and the LinUCB algorithm suggests a focus on reinforcement learning and decision making (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
