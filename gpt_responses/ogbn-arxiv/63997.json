This falls under the domain of societal impact of technology.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The proposed policy involves users interacting with each other to determine the temperature set-point, which can be seen as a social network. Additionally, the paper mentions using sensors to collect data on temperature and occupancy, which can be analyzed using network analysis techniques.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a policy that involves users giving their preferences on temperature set-points, which can be seen as a machine learning problem of predicting user preferences. Additionally, the paper mentions using reinforcement learning to optimize the policy.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the challenge of designing a policy that takes into account the diverse preferences of users, which is a human-computer interaction problem. Additionally, the proposed policy involves users interacting with a computer system to give their preferences and receive incentives.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a policy for controlling the temperature set-point of ACs in shared spaces, which can be seen as a control problem. Additionally, the paper mentions using a feedback control mechanism to adjust the temperature set-point based on user preferences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
