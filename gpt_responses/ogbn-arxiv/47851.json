This suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) in order to achieve this goal. Additionally, the paper mentions reducing spreadsheet risk, which could fall under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The experiments conducted involve generating new versions of a housing-finance spreadsheet, which could involve database systems (cs.DB) and computational geometry (cs.CY) in terms of manipulating the structure and layout of the spreadsheet."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
