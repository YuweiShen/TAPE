Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a deep stacking framework, which involves integrating models from different domains, and this could fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of Gaussian-based models, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed framework on low-resource datasets, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as this sub-category often deals with the challenges of working with limited data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
