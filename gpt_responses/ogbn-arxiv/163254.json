The use of neural graphs and the proposed methodology for convexifying them suggest that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the mention of functions and algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of graphs and the mention of variables suggest that the paper may also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
