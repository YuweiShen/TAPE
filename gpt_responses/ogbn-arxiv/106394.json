The paper specifically focuses on the performance of spectral/SDP algorithms in refuting random instances of NAE-3SAT. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Among these, cs.CC and cs.DS seem to be the most likely categories, as the paper deals with the complexity of a well-known problem and the performance of algorithms in solving it."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
