This is a problem that is commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also introduces a novel method for bidirectional text decoding, which involves using a single decoder instead of two separate decoders. This method involves optimizing the decoding process, which is a task that is commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on various benchmarks, which is a task that is commonly studied in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
