This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The problem also involves the use of private signals and information asymmetry, which are common topics in Information Theory (cs.IT) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm based on the ellipsoid method, which is a technique commonly used in optimization and machine learning, and thus could also be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
