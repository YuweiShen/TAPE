The paper specifically addresses the term mismatch problem in text retrieval-based search techniques, which is a common issue in information retrieval (IR) research. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with software-specific expansion words, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and natural language processing (NLP) (cs.CL). The use of machine learning techniques, such as Rocchio's model, indicates a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the incorporation of crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow suggests a potential connection to cybersecurity (cs.CY), as Stack Overflow is a popular platform for discussing security-related issues."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
