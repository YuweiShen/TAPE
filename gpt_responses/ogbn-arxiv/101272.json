The paper introduces a new loss function for training object detection models, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of this loss function in 3D vehicle detection, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper involves the use of a parameter that is automatically adapted during training, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
