This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as image processing and classification, as well as machine learning (LG) techniques such as neural networks. Additionally, the paper deals with 3D object retrieval and classification, which falls under the graphics (GR) category. The proposed approach also involves view selection and ensemble, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on 3D object classification and shape retrieval, which falls under the multimedia (MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
