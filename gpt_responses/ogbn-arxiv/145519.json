The use of literal information in educational knowledge graphs also suggests a potential connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the joint learning approach proposed in the paper involves neural networks, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
