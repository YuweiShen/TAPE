Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper discusses various training procedure refinements, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of optimization methods, which is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Furthermore, the paper evaluates the impact of these refinements on the final model accuracy, which involves numerical optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the improvement in transfer learning performance, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
