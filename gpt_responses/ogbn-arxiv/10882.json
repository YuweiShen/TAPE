This involves modeling social activity using marked temporal point processes and developing efficient online algorithms to steer social activity both at a user and network level. The paper also establishes a connection between optimal control of jump SDEs and doubly stochastic marked temporal point processes. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.SD (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper involves machine learning and optimization techniques, which make cs.CY (Computational Geometry) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
