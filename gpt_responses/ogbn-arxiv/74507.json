This falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communications (cs.COMM) categories. The use of quantizers and signal constellations also involves aspects of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the focus on recovering power loss suggests a possible connection to Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
