The paper also presents a novel algorithm for this problem, which involves probabilistic measurements and can be applied to a wide range of problems in compressed sensing and learning, indicating relevance to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides asymptotic performance guarantees for the algorithm, which suggests relevance to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
