The use of deep neural network dynamics models for learning to perform tactile servoing suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component. The manipulation tasks involve objects with different shapes and textures, which requires computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for object recognition and tracking. The use of unsupervised autonomous interaction and the ability to reposition objects to user-specified configurations suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) component. Finally, the framework for learning to perform tactile servoing can be applied to a wide range of robotic systems, which suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) component."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
