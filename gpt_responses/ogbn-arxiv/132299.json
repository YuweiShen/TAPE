The paper proposes a strategy to build linear classifiers that are certifiably robust against a strong variant of label-flipping, which is a problem that is relevant to all of these sub-fields. Therefore, it is likely that this paper could be classified under any of these sub-categories, with cs.LG and cs.CR being the most likely due to the focus on machine learning and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
