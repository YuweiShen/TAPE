The paper also mentions the use of distances and metrics, which are important in computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT). The mention of fast implementations suggests a focus on numerical analysis (cs.NA), and the use of adapted Variational Auto-Encoder suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
