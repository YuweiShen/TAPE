This falls under the area of programming languages (cs.PL) and formal methods (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing MPST works, which can be seen as a discussion of the foundations of the discipline, and this could fall under the area of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the properties that session typing can ensure, such as absence of communication errors and deadlocks, which falls under the area of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper proposes a novel MPST typing system, which could fall under the area of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
