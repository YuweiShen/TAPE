Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the impact of the modifications on network parameters, storage size, and accuracy, which are related to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of dedicated hardware for inference, which is related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
