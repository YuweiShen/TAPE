This involves the use of computer vision techniques, making it a likely candidate for cs.CV.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based system for multimodal translation, which involves the use of neural networks. Hence, it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the development of an AI-based system for multimodal translation, which involves the use of machine learning and computer vision techniques. Hence, it is likely to be categorized under cs.AI.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multimodal translation, which involves the use of both text and images.
