This problem is traditionally addressed through textual queries, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a feature extraction method on source codes, which could fall under the sub-categories of Software Engineering (cs.SE) or Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the integration of code and text features, which could relate to the sub-categories of Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) or Computer Vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR, followed by cs.SE, cs.LG, cs.CL, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
