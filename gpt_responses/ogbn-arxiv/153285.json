The problem involves processing both spatial and angular information, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of deep learning models to learn feature representations and estimate intermediate estimations is also a common approach in multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
