The paper also proposes a novel method for active learning, which involves selecting informative samples for manual labeling, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Bayesian sampling and autoencoders also suggests a potential fit for machine learning theory (cs.MS) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
