However, the use of citation graphs and the axiomatic approach suggest that the paper is more likely to belong to sub-categories such as cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CY (Computers and Society). Additionally, the mention of a trade-off between two axiomatic properties and a dilemma of aggregation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
