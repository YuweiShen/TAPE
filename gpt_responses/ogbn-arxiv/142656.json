This involves training patch classifiers on segmentation masks of lesions in mammograms and then using the learned features to initialize a scanning-based model that renders a decision on the whole image. This approach is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for image classification and analysis. The topic of mammogram classification falls under medical imaging (cs.MM), which is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks for classification falls under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
