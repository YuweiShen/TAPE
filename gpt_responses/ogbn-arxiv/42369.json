This is a core topic in social network analysis and falls under the scope of cs.SI.\n2. cs.SOC (Computational Social Science) - The paper draws on social science theories to guide feature engineering for signed link analysis. This interdisciplinary approach aligns with the focus of cs.SOC.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses machine learning techniques for link prediction and feature selection. This is a common approach in the field of machine learning and falls under the scope of cs.LG.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses the use of features to improve link prediction in signed networks. This is a common problem in information retrieval and falls under the scope of cs.IR.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses machine learning techniques to address the problem of data sparsity in signed link analysis.
