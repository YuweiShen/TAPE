The code is designed to improve the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC) categories. The code also shows strong adaptivity to single frequency network broadcasting deployments, which involves system-level optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
