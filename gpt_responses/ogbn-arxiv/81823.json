This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) domain. The paper also proposes an adversarial learning framework, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a novel multi-source discriminator to distinguish the predicted 3D poses from the ground-truth is related to the field of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the experiments involve the use of public benchmarks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
