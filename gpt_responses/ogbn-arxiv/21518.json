The paper also discusses upper and lower bounds on list decoding, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents an efficient list decoding algorithm, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
