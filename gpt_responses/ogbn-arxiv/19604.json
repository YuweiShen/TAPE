The use of ridge regression and other DNN constituents also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of spectral histogram features may indicate a connection to signal processing (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
