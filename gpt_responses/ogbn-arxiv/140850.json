This involves leveraging a database of diagnostic images to supplement the less available interventional images. The paper uses 3D geometrical information provided by a position sensor embedded in the ICE catheter and 3D image appearance information from a set of computed tomography cardiac volumes. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), medical imaging (cs.MED), and computational neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
