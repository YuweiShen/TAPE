This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as object detection and tracking, and machine learning (ML) techniques such as learning to re-rank proposals. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves ML techniques such as instance-specific objectness measure and learning to re-rank proposals, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. The paper also involves robotics (RO) techniques such as tracking moving objects, which makes cs.RO a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) techniques such as processing low-frame-rate videos, which makes cs.MM a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
