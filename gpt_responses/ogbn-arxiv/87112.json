This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI), as well as systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer engineering (cs.CE). The use of stochastic geometry to model the random spatial patterns of transmitters also suggests a connection to probability and statistics (cs.PR). However, given the focus on communication and networking, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
