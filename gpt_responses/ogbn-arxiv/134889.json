It may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category as it deals with video processing. The use of deep learning models for motion estimation and compensation suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the use of dynamic local filters and global refinement networks suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
