This involves optimizing over several sources of uncertainty and coordinating between vehicles. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deal with developing and applying intelligent algorithms. The paper also involves control and optimization, which are covered by cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Finally, the paper deals with robotics and automation, which are covered by cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
