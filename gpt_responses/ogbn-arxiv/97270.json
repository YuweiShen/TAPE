Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of real-valued referential properties and embeddings, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the construction of a dataset, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves probing the efficacy of different types of information, which could place it in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
