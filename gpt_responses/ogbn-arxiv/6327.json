This involves analyzing code and identifying potential vulnerabilities, which falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) and computer security (cs.CR) categories. The paper also discusses the use of hierarchical deep learning models and regularization techniques, which are topics commonly studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories.
