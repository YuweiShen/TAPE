The proposed method involves using spectral graph filters, which are a type of machine learning algorithm, to estimate the best center coordinate of the target. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to subfields such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
