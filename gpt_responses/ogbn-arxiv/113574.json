This involves joint optimization of the transmitter and receiver, which is a typical problem in information theory (cs.IT). The use of neural network-based autoencoders for this optimization suggests a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the behavior of the energy harvester in different input power regimes, which is related to nonlinear dynamics (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of modulation schemes for SWIPT involves digital signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
