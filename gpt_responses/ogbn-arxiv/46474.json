The paper proposes an empirical risk minimization problem for a multi-stage reject classifier and introduces an iterative algorithm in the boosting framework. The problem formulation and algorithmic approach are closely related to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves the use of datasets and evaluation metrics, which are common in the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
