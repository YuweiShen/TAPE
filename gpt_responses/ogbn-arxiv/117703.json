Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a general framework for cross-modal pair discrimination, which involves training a model to distinguish between pairs of video and text. This is a machine learning (ML) task, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG and cs.MM. Finally, the paper leverages the abundance of text information in videos, which is a form of information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
