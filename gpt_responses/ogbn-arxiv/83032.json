The paper also discusses the challenges of applying 2D CNN to 3D anisotropic volumes, which is a problem in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of focal loss for more effective learning is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
