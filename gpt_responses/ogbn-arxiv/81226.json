This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) as it involves coding theory and error correction. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of these codes in cryptography (cs.CR) and their use in communication systems (cs.SI). The study of skew cyclic codes and their spanning sets also falls under the category of discrete structures (cs.DS) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
