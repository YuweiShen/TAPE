Specifically, the study uses a large-scale dataset from SCOPUS, which suggests a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The analysis also involves classification schemes (cs.CY) and normalization methods (cs.SD) to remove the impact of journal prestige on citation patterns. Finally, the study investigates the knowledge structure of science and technology, which could be related to social networks (cs.SI) and other interdisciplinary fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
