The use of attention mechanisms and neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the proposed connection sensitive loss and metrics could fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the use of medical imaging datasets could also suggest the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
