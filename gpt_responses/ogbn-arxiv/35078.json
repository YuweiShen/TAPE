It discusses the use of explanations and predictions from machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing and classification tasks, which are covered by cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, since the paper deals with ethical and legal concerns related to deception detection, it could also be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
