The paper focuses on improving the efficiency of learning novel tasks, which is a common problem in RL. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions the use of self-supervised reward shaping, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
