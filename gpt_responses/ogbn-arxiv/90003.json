It proposes a method to enhance the noise robustness of neural networks using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions electronic, optical, and photonic devices, which suggests the sub-categories cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) and cs.EM (Electromagnetics) as possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
