The approach involves maximizing control capabilities of agents in an environment, which is a common theme in machine learning and robotics (cs.LG, cs.RO). The paper also includes experimental studies on video game environments, which are often studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
