The use of calibrated probabilities and the focus on reliability and out-of-distribution input suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV), where these issues are also important. The mention of an adversary and the need for formal bounds suggest a connection to computer security (cs.CR), and the use of medical diagnosis from genomic data suggests a connection to computational biology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
