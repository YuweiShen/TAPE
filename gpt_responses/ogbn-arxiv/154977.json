This involves constructing a directed graph with terminal nodes and weightings that represent the affinity of a voxel to the vertebra and background, as well as a smoothness term. The method involves computational optimization and evaluation of the segmentation result. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Multimedia (cs.MM), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
