The method uses coverage graphs converted to 1D-signals and employs a semi-supervised approach to reduce the need for labeled data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
