This involves incorporating context information from larger subsequences containing the anomaly candidates, which suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed algorithm is also designed to be efficient, which suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper involves extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which suggests a focus on databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
