This involves channel estimation and data transmission for both user devices (UDs) and remote radio units (RRUs). The paper proposes a global optimization approach to boost the fronthaul capacity of the C-RAN. The topic of the paper is related to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
