Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also mentions cloud infrastructures and virtual machines, which are related to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.OS (Operating Systems). Additionally, the use of containerization technology and the integration of Docker Swarm suggest a possible fit with cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
