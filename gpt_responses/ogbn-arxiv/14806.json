The proposed method involves using learned MDP transition models, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of bootstrapping and bias in model estimation, which are topics in statistics and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
