Information theory deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information, which is relevant to the study of encryption algorithms. \n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper may involve discussions on the computational complexity of the Rijndael algorithm, which is relevant to this category. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The Rijndael algorithm can be seen as a system that takes in plaintext and outputs ciphertext. The paper may discuss the control aspects of this system, which is relevant to this category. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper may discuss the implementation of the Rijndael algorithm in software, which is relevant to this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
