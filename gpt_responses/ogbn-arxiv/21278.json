Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses performance measures such as bit error probability and capacity, which are related to communication systems and signal processing, suggesting cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) as another likely sub-category. The use of millimeter wave and free-space optical channels also suggests cs.PHY (Physics and Society) as a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses level crossing rate and average fade duration, which are related to network protocols and link quality, suggesting cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the statistics of the received signal envelope, which is relevant to system design and optimization, suggesting cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
