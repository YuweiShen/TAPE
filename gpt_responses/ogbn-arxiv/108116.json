The algorithm uses adaptive sampling and triplet-based queries, which are common techniques in human-computer interaction and crowdsourcing (cs.HC, cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of SVMs to evaluate the crowd kernel, which is a common machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
