The paper also proposes a highly distributed scheme for detecting violations of user-defined QoS constraints, which is related to database systems (cs.DB) and control systems (cs.SY). The example streaming application mentioned in the paper is from the multimedia domain (cs.MM), and the paper also discusses the scalability of traditional stream processing systems, which is a topic in networked and distributed systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
