Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of different types of RNN models, which falls under the scope of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper explores the memory depth of RNN models, which is related to the architecture and optimization of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the proposed method, such as the efficient representation of n-gram contexts, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
