This method is less computationally intensive and less expensive when compared to computer vision approaches. It is also not affected by lighting factors, which limit computer vision solutions. Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely category as it is mentioned in the paper as a comparison to the proposed method. Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is also a possible category as machine learning approaches are used in the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
