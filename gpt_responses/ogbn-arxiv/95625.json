The paper also mentions the use of utility functions and adaptation rules, which are concepts commonly used in systems and control engineering (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as the architectural level, which is relevant to the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a pattern-based approach, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
