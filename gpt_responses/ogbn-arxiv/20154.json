The use of mean-variance as a risk measure is also common in economics and finance, which suggests the paper could also be relevant to the game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. The paper also discusses policies and algorithms for solving the MAB problem, which could be of interest to the control systems (cs.SY) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
