The introduction of bidirectional architectures that reason with top-down feedback also involves latent variables, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also unifies several approaches for recognition, including generative deep models (e.g., Boltzmann machines) and discriminative latent-variable models (e.g., DPMs), which are relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the proposed models, including multi-task learning and pixel segmentation, which are relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
