The proposed system is based on machine learning techniques, specifically ConvNets, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of videos, which can be considered as multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the use of optical flow, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
