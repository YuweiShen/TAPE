The method is evaluated on several image classification tasks, indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The approach involves joint training of the estimator and selector networks, suggesting a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also discusses the versatility of the proposed approach, indicating a potential interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications. Finally, the use of a sampling-based learning strategy suggests a potential interest in neural networks (cs.NE) and reinforcement learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
