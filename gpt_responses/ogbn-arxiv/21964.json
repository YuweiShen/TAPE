This suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The proposed algorithm for enforcing generalised arc consistency also indicates that the paper could belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) or Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the experimental results on several problem domains suggest that the paper could also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
