This involves the use of SDN and NFV technologies, which are key components of modern networking and internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper proposes the use of quantum key distribution (QKD) as a future-proof method for securing distributed and virtualized network services. This involves the use of quantum-physics mechanisms to ensure that the communication between network functions is immune to any algorithmic cryptanalysis. \n\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of QKD as a method for secure communication, which is a key topic in information theory. The paper also proposes extensions to SDN-enabled optical control plane and NFV orchestration to achieve quantum-aware, on-demand chaining of VNFs, which involves the use of information theory concepts. \n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - Although the paper does not directly relate to robotics, the use of SDN and NFV technologies in the proposed quantum-secured optical network can be applied to robotics systems that require secure and dynamic communication between different components. \n\n5. cs.OH (Other Computer Science) - This category is a catch-all"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
