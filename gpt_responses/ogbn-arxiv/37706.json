The paper also discusses the use of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) methods, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for robotic perception and localization. The study also involves testing the algorithms in different environments and with different types of sensor noise, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper mentions the use of visual odometry, which is a computer vision technique (cs.CV). Finally, the paper involves a comparative study of different algorithms, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
