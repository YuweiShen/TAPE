This falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of data-driven approaches for selecting the scheduling variable, which involves machine learning techniques such as regression and clustering, which could fall under categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and statistical learning (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of optimization techniques for model identification, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
