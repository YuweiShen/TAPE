Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses game theory, which makes cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses automata theory, which makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category.
