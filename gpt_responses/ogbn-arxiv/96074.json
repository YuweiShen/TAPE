The paper proposes a synchronization-free approach for timestamping the uplink data at the LoRaWAN gateway, which can give milliseconds accuracy. The paper also proposes a SoftLoRa gateway design to address the frame delay attack. Therefore, this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This paper discusses a security issue in LoRaWAN and proposes a solution to address the attack. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This paper discusses a low-power wide-area network technology, LoRaWAN, and proposes a synchronization-free approach for timestamping the data. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This paper proposes a SoftLoRa gateway design that integrates a commodity LoRaWAN gateway with a low-power software-defined radio receiver to track the inherent frequency biases of LoRaWAN end devices. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper mentions the use of efficient signal processing algorithms designed based on LoRaWAN's modulation method to achieve frequency bias estimation. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This paper discusses the resolution of frequency bias estimation achieved by the proposed SoftLoRa gateway design, which is based on Lo"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
