The approach is applied to the Enterprise Java Beans component standard, which is commonly used in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions self-management capabilities, which are relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of different runtime models for different concerns suggests a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and the use of model-driven engineering techniques suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
