The use of topic modelling and regression to automate rating for suitability suggests a focus on computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) in the process of identifying inappropriate content. The use of a large corpus of narratives from a community-based self-publishing website suggests a focus on social media (cs.SI) and cyber security (cs.CY). Finally, the provocative title \"Sex Drugs And Violence\" suggests a potential focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) or computer graphics (cs.GR), but these are less likely given the content of the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
