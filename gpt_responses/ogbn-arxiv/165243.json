The use of human supervision and reasoning to collect high-quality data suggests a potential overlap with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of computer vision (cs.CV) in the abstract also suggests a potential focus on visual perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, the evaluation of the platform's utility through quantitative and qualitative analysis suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
