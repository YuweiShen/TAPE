This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a specialized interactive proof protocol for verifiable execution of deep neural networks, which involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as well as software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's focus on ensuring correctness and accuracy in the execution of neural networks could also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
