Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a recurrent learning approach, which involves deep learning and neural networks, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of regression loss and decoupling of temporal-variant and temporal-invariant features, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of recurrent learning, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
