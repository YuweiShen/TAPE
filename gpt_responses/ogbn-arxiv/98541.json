This approach involves extending the Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization applied to Tree (HOOT) method to adapt to environments with a continuous decision space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): MCTS is a popular algorithm in AI, and the paper proposes an approach to improve its performance in continuous decision space environments. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method to balance the selection of actions and the time for MCTS simulations, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The approach presented in the paper can be applied to robotics tasks that involve continuous decision spaces, such as controlling a robot arm. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method to optimize the performance of a decision-making system (MCTS) in a continuously running task. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): MCTS is widely used in game theory, and the paper evaluates the proposed approach in the arcade learning environment (ALE) platform, which includes various games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
