The paper also proposes a new semi-supervised learning framework, which involves training a model with a small number of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples. This is a common problem in machine learning, and falls under the category of semi-supervised learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a new model architecture to handle noisy labels, which is a problem in both computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the paper could also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) since handling noisy labels is a common problem in these fields as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
