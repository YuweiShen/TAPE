This involves the use of memory networks and attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP and ML. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of deep learning models, specifically the Transformer architecture, which is a popular model for NMT. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which covers topics related to ML and deep learning. \n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for selecting the most salient part of the document context, which involves the use of attention mechanisms. This could be relevant to the cs.LG (Learning) sub-category, which covers topics related to ML and optimization. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of memory networks, which are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). This suggests that the paper could be relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category, which covers topics related to RNNs and other neural network architectures. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of information retrieval (IR) techniques"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
