The paper proposes a novel concept of learning in auctions, which involves the use of no-envy learning, a notion founded upon Walrasian equilibrium. This concept is related to machine learning (cs.AI) and reinforcement learning (cs.LG), as it involves the use of learning algorithms to optimize welfare in repeated auctions. The paper also introduces a novel Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader algorithm, which has applications outside of auction settings, such as in security games, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
