This falls under the domain of computational engineering and science. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the use of numerical methods for mesh generation and simulation of fluid dynamics. This falls under the domain of numerical analysis. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the use of CAD tools for mesh generation, which falls under the domain of computer graphics. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper discusses the use of medial axis technology for partitioning the near-field into blocks, which falls under the domain of computational geometry. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper discusses the use of two software tools, CADfix and NekMesh, for mesh generation and simulation. This falls under the domain of mathematical software."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
