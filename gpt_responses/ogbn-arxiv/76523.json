This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the impact of interference on the channel dispersion, which is relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper characterizes the speed of convergence of rates of optimal block codes towards a boundary point of the capacity region, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
