This involves exploiting regularity assumptions on the dynamics and constructing provably accurate confidence intervals on predicted trajectories. The paper also discusses the use of a terminal set constraint to recursively guarantee the existence of safe control actions. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves the use of AI techniques for control, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of statistical methods for constructing confidence intervals, which makes cs.SD (Statistics and Data Analysis) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
