It also involves fairness concepts, which are often studied in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The complexity results and polynomial-time algorithms presented in the paper suggest that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
