This involves analyzing CT images and extracting spatial features along the branches. This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of a hybrid model containing 3D CNN and LSTM suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of partial differential equations (PDEs) in graph modeling suggests a neural network (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of medical imaging data suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
