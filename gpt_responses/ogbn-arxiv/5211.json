The paper discusses the importance of preserving the relative distances among the acquired compressed samples for efficient estimation of the actual signal, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes a new fast DL algorithm for extracting prototype signals from compressive samples, which can be used for signal recovery. This falls under the categories of signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for capturing the envelope of a signal, which is a popular method in multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
