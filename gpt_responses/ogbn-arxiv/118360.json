The use of skip connections and deep supervision also suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.LG) techniques. The proposed loss function and its inspiration from focal loss indicate a potential connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The use of neural networks for segmentation also suggests a possible connection to neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the use of medical images suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
