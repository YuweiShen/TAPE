The paper also focuses on the distributed nature of the IoT and proposes a fully distributed IDS, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses GANs to detect anomalous behavior, which is a common application of deep learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
