The paper proposes a variant of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm to tackle the architecture optimization problem. BO is a popular method in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning and architecture search. The paper also proposes a training-free method to estimate the network performance, which reduces the evaluation time of candidate architectures. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This is the most likely category, as the paper is about optimizing the architecture of neural networks using a machine learning method (BO).\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This category is also likely, as the paper is about optimizing the performance of RNNs for time series prediction, which is a common task in AI.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This category is relevant, as the paper is about optimizing the architecture of neural networks using a variant of the BO algorithm.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This category is less likely, but still relevant, as RNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as video analysis and image captioning.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This category is less likely, but still relevant, as RNNs are commonly used in control systems and robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
