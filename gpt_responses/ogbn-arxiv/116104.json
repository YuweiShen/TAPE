The focus of the paper is on reducing the complexity of sphere decoding, which is a common technique in coding theory (cs.CC). The proposed algorithm involves a novel path metric, which is a measure of the quality of a candidate decoding path, and this is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of approximations in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, which is a common consideration in communication networks (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
