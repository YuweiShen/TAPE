The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and regularization techniques, which are common in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of feedback signals during training, which is a topic often discussed in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization, which is a topic commonly discussed in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of pose information to improve object recognition, which is a topic commonly discussed in the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
