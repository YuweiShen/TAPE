The paper discusses the capacity region of this problem and introduces a new structure called the generalized lexicographic product structure. This structure is a natural condition under which the index coding problem can be decomposed into multiple interacting subproblems. The paper uses random coding to provide a new multiletter characterization of the capacity region and to construct a new multiletter code of matching rates. Based on this analysis, the paper discusses several special cases that recover and strengthen known structural properties of the index coding capacity region. Given the focus on information theory and coding, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
