The proposed efficient schemes for mapping DCNNs on a uniform architecture involve hardware optimization techniques (cs.AR) and aim to improve both throughput and energy efficiency (cs.NE). The implementation is done on an FPGA platform (cs.SY), and the paper also discusses comparisons with CPU and GPU solutions, which are topics related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
