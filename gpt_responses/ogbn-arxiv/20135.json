Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also uses evolutionary game theory to model the access strategy of each secondary user, which suggests the possibility of cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as another likely category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the mutual interference among primary users, secondary users, and malicious users, which could be categorized as cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of interference on the network's performance, which could be related to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
