The use of quantization and aggregation techniques for privacy preservation suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant sub-categories. The mention of \"data structure\" and \"Bloom filter\" suggests that the paper may also be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR).
