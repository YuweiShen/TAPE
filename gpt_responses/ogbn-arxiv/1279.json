It also involves algorithms for sorting and minimizing automata, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and combinatorial optimization (cs.DM). The use of co-lexicographic ordering and Myhill-Nerode equivalence suggests connections to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
