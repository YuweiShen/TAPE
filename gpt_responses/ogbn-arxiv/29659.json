The paper also discusses the use of cryptography for secure communication, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for extracting randomness from physiological signals, which could be relevant to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of this randomness for cryptographic operations in medical devices, which could be relevant to the field of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
