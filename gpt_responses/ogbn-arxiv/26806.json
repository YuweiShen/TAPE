The planner uses predictive models to plan trajectories, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The planner also takes into account obstacles in the environment, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
