The paper also discusses the integration of story reasoning capabilities into conditional language generation models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves the evaluation of several competitive baselines based on pretrained language models, which suggests the relevance of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also includes the assessment of automatic metrics for text generation, which indicates the relevance of cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
