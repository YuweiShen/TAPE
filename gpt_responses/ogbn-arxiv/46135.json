This topic falls under the broad category of computer architecture (cs.AR) and specifically relates to the design of memory systems (cs.ET) for neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of SRAM (static random-access memory) for this purpose, which is a topic in electronic design automation (cs.EM) and digital circuits (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
