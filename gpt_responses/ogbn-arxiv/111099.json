The paper proposes a new estimator that reduces variance by avoiding duplicate samples, which is relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of the estimator in policy gradient methods, which is relevant to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimator, which is relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
