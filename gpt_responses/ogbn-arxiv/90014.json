The paper also mentions the applicability of graph structured data in computer vision (cs.CV) and social networks (cs.SI), indicating that these sub-categories are also relevant. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for local interpretable model explanations, which is a topic that falls under natural language processing (cs.CL).
