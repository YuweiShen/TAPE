Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of scheduling policies on AoI performance, which involves optimization and control theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) likely categories as well. The paper also proposes policies based on update size and arrival time, which could fall under cs.PF (Performance) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
