Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and software implementation, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of probability mass function factorization and chain-rules suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control), while the removal of redundant constraints is related to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
