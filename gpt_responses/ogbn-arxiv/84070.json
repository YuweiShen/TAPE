The paper proposes a new backbone network architecture for object detection that is more energy and computation efficient than existing architectures. This makes it likely that the paper would also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories. The paper also discusses the technical details of the proposed architecture, which involves optimizing the use of GPU resources, so it could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) subcategories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
