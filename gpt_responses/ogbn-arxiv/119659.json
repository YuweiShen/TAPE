The proposed solution involves using image classification algorithms (cs.CV) and imitation learning (cs.LG) to train the UAV to navigate through city streets. The paper also mentions the use of data-driven solutions (cs.AI) and the need for autonomy in UAVs (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
