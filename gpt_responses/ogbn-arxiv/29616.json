It is also likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.GT (Game Theory) because it deals with cooperative games and proposes a novel representation scheme for such games. Additionally, it may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) because it uses online Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling. It may also belong to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) because it deals with relations among agents and their collaboration structures.
