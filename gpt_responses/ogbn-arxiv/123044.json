Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves feature extraction and classification, which are common topics in cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
