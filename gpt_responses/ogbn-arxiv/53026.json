The paper also mentions the development of automated systems, which could be related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the focus on user interfaces suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
