The paper also proposes a novel dynamic feature fusion strategy that involves learning fusion weights, which suggests that it may fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, which is a common technique in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
