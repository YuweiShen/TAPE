The paper presents a Las Vegas data structure for this problem in high dimensions under the $\\ell_p$ norm, which is a topic that falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also makes use of techniques from information theory (cs.IT), computational geometry (cs.CG), and machine learning (cs.LG) to achieve its results. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of its data structure in terms of space-time tradeoffs, which is a topic that falls under the category of data management (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
