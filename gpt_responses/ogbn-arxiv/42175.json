This is a topic that falls under the scope of programming languages research. \n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper presents a systematic design of relational numerical abstract domains, which involves the use of potential graphs and shortest-path closure algorithms. These are concepts that are commonly studied in the field of logic in computer science. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of abstract domains in static analysis, which is a topic that is relevant to software engineering research. \n4. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper involves the use of formal methods to design abstract domains, which is a topic that falls under the scope of formal languages and automata theory. \n5. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper involves the use of symbolic computation techniques to design abstract domains, which is a topic that falls under the scope of symbolic computation research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
