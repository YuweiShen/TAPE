The method involves deep reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the theoretical foundation and convergence to Nash Equilibrium, which relates to control systems (cs.SY) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the proposed method involves the decoupling of the road network, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
