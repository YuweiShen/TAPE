The paper proposes a quantitative model for predicting this interference, which takes into account the amount of simultaneous access to shared resources such as SLLC, DRAM, and virtual network. This work involves aspects of distributed computing, networking, operating systems, software engineering, and architecture, which are covered by the above-mentioned sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
