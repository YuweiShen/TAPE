Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval techniques, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of state-of-the-art classifiers suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
