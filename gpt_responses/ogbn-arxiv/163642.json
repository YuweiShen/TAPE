The algorithm proposed in the paper is an end-to-end learning method, which involves deep neural networks (cs.LG) and is evaluated on tasks such as image retrieval and image annotation (cs.MM, cs.IR). The paper also discusses the design of a joint cross entropy loss, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
