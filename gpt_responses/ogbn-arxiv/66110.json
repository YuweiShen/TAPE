The paper proposes a new method for tracking objects in videos using discriminative correlation filters. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques such as feature selection and filter learning, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper evaluates its proposed method on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics). Overall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.RO, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
