The use of sum-of-squares proofs for reasoning about polynomial systems suggests a connection to optimization (cs.LG) and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the connection between sum-of-squares refutations and spectral algorithms suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
