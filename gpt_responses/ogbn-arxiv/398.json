The proposed approach involves merging multiple grid maps, which is a task that is typically performed by robots. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves computer vision techniques for map merging, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes an approach that involves graph-based sampling and motion averaging, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the use of multiple robots, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
