Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a multipath transmission framework and formulates the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), which involves optimization and decision-making algorithms, indicating that it may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper specifically mentions mmWave communications, which is a topic related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AR (Augmented Reality)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
