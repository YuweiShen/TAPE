The use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) community. The low power assumption and the use of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes for information reconciliation indicate that the paper may also be of interest to the systems and control (cs.SY) community, which deals with the design and analysis of complex systems. Finally, the numerical results presented in the paper suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) community, which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data over networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
