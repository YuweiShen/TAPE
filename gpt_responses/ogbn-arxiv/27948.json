The paper also proposes a framework for constructing problem instances and investigates the behavior of backtracking search algorithms, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper uses experimental studies to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, which could be related to data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
