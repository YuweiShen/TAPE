This involves exploring a transformation graph to systematically enumerate the space of given options. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses a framework for automating feature engineering in predictive modeling, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of reinforcement learning to derive an efficient exploration strategy is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The exploration of a transformation graph involves the use of algorithms and data structures. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The framework presented in the paper involves the automation of a process that is typically performed manually, which is a subfield of software engineering. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the framework presented could be applied to feature engineering in computer vision tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
