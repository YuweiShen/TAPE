The paper specifically focuses on encryption-less algorithms, which are commonly used in the field of cryptography and computer security. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves the use of routing algorithms and packet transmission, which are related to network infrastructure and protocols. This suggests that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is also a likely category. The paper also mentions the use of polynomials, which are a mathematical concept related to algebra and number theory. This suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are also possible categories. Finally, the paper involves the use of authentication codes, which are related to coding theory and error correction. This suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
