Bag of visual words (BoVWs) is a well-established visual recognition technique, which is commonly used in computer vision problems like object and scene recognition. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with incorporating spatial information into the BoVWs technique, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.DL (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with classification, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
