It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a common task in IR. Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on multi-document summarization could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
