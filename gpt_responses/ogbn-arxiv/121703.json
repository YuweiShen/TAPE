Based on the content of the abstract, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper introduces new formalisms for modeling structured data using probabilistic graphical models and probabilistic programming languages. The paper also mentions natural language, which suggests that it may be relevant to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper discusses the scalability of the proposed methods, which could be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
