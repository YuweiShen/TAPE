Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also focuses on promoting higher robustness and invariance in the embedding space, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper applies the proposed approach to Transformer-based models, which are commonly used in natural language understanding tasks, indicating that it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions experiments on the GLUE benchmark, which involves natural language understanding tasks, and experiments on the CommonsenseQA benchmark, which involves commonsense reasoning tasks, suggesting that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
