The approach proposed in the paper is based on physical intuition and does not involve formal techniques like Kalman filtering. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Control Systems (cs.SY) or Robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of an external aid for feedback, which could be related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) techniques. Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of the proposed approach for implementation on a moving land vehicle, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
