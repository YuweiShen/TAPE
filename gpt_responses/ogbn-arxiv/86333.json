This task involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the computer science sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational complexity (cs.CC).
