The paper discusses the use of terahertz (THz) range for wireless communication, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms to predict mobility-induced outages, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the tradeoffs involved in improving user coverage through a single THz-AP, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and augmented reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
