It also involves instance segmentation, which is a popular topic in deep learning (cs.CL). The proposed method uses Mask R-CNN, which is a deep learning architecture (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of location-aware supervision, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on standard datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
