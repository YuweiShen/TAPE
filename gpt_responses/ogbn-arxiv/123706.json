The paper also introduces new network modules for learning global spatial and channel relationships, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of these modules also involves neural networks (cs.NE) and graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
