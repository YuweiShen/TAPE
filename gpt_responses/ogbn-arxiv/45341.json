This falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves the use of computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.DS) in the proofs. Additionally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the codes in distributed storage systems (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
