The use of a classic learning strategy and boosted forests classifier also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks and feature maps, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) if the focus is on detecting faces for security purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
