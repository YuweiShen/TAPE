Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The algorithm is designed to support inputs from either SMBG or CGM devices, which are commonly used by T1D patients to measure glucose concentrations. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Control Engineering (cs.CE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper aims to provide personalised adaptive insulin optimization, which is related to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
