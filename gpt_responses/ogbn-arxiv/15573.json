The paper also discusses the use of point processes to model base station tiers, which is a topic related to stochastic processes (cs.SI) and mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the paper proposes simple approximations for the SIR meta distribution, which is a topic related to probability theory (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
