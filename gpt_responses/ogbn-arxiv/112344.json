This falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as the system is designed to retrieve relevant products for customers. The use of natural language processing techniques such as Word2Vec also suggests a possible fit under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS) in designing the recommendation system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
