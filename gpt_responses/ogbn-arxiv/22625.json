This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper provides upper bounds on the capacity of timing channels and establishes achievable rates for specific queue models. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies a queueing model that drops arriving packets while a packet is in service, which is a common scenario in networking and internet architecture. The paper provides insights into the capacity of such bufferless queues and their impact on the performance of timing channels. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper analyzes the behavior of a queueing system with independent and identically distributed service times, which is a classic problem in systems and control. The paper provides upper bounds on the capacity of timing channels and establishes achievable rates for specific queue models, which are relevant to the design and optimization of communication systems. \n4. cs.PF (Performance): The paper investigates the capacity of timing channels under a bufferless queueing model, which is relevant to the performance analysis of communication systems. The paper provides upper bounds on the capacity of timing channels and establishes achievable rates for specific queue models, which can be used to evaluate the performance of communication protocols and algorithms. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
