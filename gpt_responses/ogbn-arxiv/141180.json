The paper also discusses the simplicity and parallel-friendliness of the proposed algorithm, which suggests that it may be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) or scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the paper mentions the use of an AD-agnostic compiler plugin, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
