The paper proposes a method for constructing two-layer neural networks that can handle high-dimensional data and infinite-dimensional output spaces. This is a problem that is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
