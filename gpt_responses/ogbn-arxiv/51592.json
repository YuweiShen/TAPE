The paper discusses the use of model-based rewards transferred from tasks that directly compare the similarity of sentence pairs. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
