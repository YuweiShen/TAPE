The paper also discusses the use of stochastic-coordinate-descent methods, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical optimization (cs.NA). The experiments involve solving problems such as vertex cover, independent set, and multiway-cut, which are classic problems in the subfield of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
