This is a classic problem in information theory, where the goal is to optimize the transmission of information over a noisy channel. \n2. cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper formulates a contract design problem where the primary license holder must design contracts that cater to different types of buyers. This involves strategic interactions between the primary license holder and the buyers, which is a classic problem in game theory. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of allocating spectrum resources in a secondary market, which is a classic problem in networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with the problem of designing contracts that protect the interests of the primary license holder while ensuring that the buyers get a fair deal. This involves issues of trust, privacy, and security, which are classic problems in cryptography and security. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithm for generating a set of contracts in a computationally efficient manner. This involves issues of data structures and algorithms, which are classic problems in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
