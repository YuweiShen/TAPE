The algorithms involve random walks, which are often studied in the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also discusses load balancing, which is a topic in the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The algorithms presented involve computations, which fall under the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category.
