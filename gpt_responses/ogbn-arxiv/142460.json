This involves analyzing the movement of vehicles, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper deals with autonomous vehicles, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The method used is based on recurrent neural networks, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing to consolidate the multi-modal nature of the output probability distribution, which falls under computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
