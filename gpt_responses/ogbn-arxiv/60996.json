The paper uses a large-scale image dataset and behavioral annotations to train models using Inverse-Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to learn target-specific reward functions and policies. The paper also discusses the use of reward maps to reveal target-specific patterns that suggest attention guidance by both target features and scene context. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
