The paper proposes a new architecture called Distilling with Residual Network (DRN) for this task, which involves using residual distilling blocks (RDBs) and residual distilling groups (RDGs) to extract efficient features from low-resolution images. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
