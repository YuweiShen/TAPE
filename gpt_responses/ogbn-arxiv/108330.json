The use of an HMM and GRU for frame labeling suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also introduces a new constrained discriminative forward loss (CDFL) for training under weak supervision, which could be of interest to researchers in natural language processing (cs.CL) who work with similar constraints on labeling tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
