It also introduces the concept of porosity, which is related to finite-state compressibility and predictability, suggesting possible connections to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents a sequence of schemes that achieve porosity, which could be considered a form of algorithm design (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses communication across modulo-additive channels, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
