The most commonly used deep architectures such as autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are also discussed, which are primarily used in computer vision and natural language processing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
