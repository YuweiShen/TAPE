Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses aspects of visual quality and implementation details, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The evaluation metrics and parameter optimization could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
