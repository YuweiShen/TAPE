The evaluation of the technique involves quantitative measurements of preattentiveness, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of virtual reality (VR) is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of VR (cs.VR). Finally, the paper discusses the integration of the technique into a volume rendering workflow, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
