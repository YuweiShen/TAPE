The focus is on adaptive measurements, which involves choosing the measurement vectors based on previous measurements, making it relevant to the subfield of adaptive signal processing (cs.DS). The paper also uses techniques from numerical analysis (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.SI) to derive the lower bounds."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
