The paper also discusses the limitations of traditional HPC approaches for data-intensive workloads, which is related to Database Systems (cs.DB). The proposed extension of the Pilot-Abstraction to Hadoop and in-memory resources is a contribution to Computer Engineering (cs.CE). The paper also discusses the need for abstractions to reason about performance trade-offs, which is related to Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes solutions for enhancing the usability and variety of analytical libraries, which is related to Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
