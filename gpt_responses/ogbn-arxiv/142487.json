Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a set of metrics for automated evaluation, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses tradeoffs between different aspects of interest, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions using Word Mover's Distance, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
