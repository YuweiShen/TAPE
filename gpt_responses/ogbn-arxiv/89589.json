The paper also discusses the use of human experts to assist in the alignment process, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper proposes a novel approach to active network alignment, which involves constructing and solving a bipartite matching problem, which is a common problem in data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
