The codes are also suitable for authentication and secret sharing, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR). The weight enumerators and complete weight enumerators are important tools in coding theory and combinatorics (cs.DM). The codes are constructed using a defining set, which is a concept in coding theory and algebraic geometry (cs.CC). Finally, the codes have applications in secure information transmission, which is a topic in security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
