This involves the use of channel-aware caching and coded multicasting to serve multiple cache-enabled receivers requesting different content and experiencing different channel conditions. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with joint source-channel coding and achievable schemes for preserving multiplicative throughput gains, which are topics related to information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper addresses the challenges of delivering video-based services over wireless access networks, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on the delivery of multimedia services, specifically video-based services, which is a topic related to multimedia. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with the challenge of serving multiple cache-enabled receivers simultaneously, which is a topic related to distributed computing. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper may also be related to social and information networks, as it deals with the challenge of delivering video-based services to an exponentially growing number of multimedia capable mobile devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
