The proposed method involves data-driven techniques, which could also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or computer vision (cs.CV). The use of semi-autonomous functions in abdominal surgeries suggests a potential application in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the need for high accuracy in end effector position estimation could involve artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
