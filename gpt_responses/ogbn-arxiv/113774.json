The paper discusses various methods for handling local deformations and articulations, which are important topics in computer vision and graphics. The paper also proposes a new method for determining which portions of the shape should be used for geometric corrections, which is a key problem in shape matching. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), multimedia (cs.MM), robotics (cs.RO), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
