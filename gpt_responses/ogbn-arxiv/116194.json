The paper also discusses how the definition handles problematic examples from the literature, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CR) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on causality and counterfactuals is relevant to the field of causal explanation (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
