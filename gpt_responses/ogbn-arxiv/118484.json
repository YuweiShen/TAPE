The paper discusses the evaluation of different competence measures for DRS, which are used to quantify the performance of the regressors in local regions of the feature space. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). However, given the focus on machine learning and regression problems, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.NE, cs.CV, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
