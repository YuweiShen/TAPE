The approach is model-free and does not require additional reward engineering or domain expertise, making it relevant to the machine learning community (cs.LG). The method involves introducing an auxiliary distance-based reward to encourage diverse exploration, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in solving tasks in a Minecraft environment, which is a popular platform for computer vision research (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
