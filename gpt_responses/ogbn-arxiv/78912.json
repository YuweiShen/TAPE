The focus on improving the efficiency of deep learning computing suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR) may also be relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the mention of hardware co-design and energy efficiency suggests that systems and control (cs.SY) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
