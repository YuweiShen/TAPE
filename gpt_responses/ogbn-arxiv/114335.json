This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. The use of a mobile thermal camera integrated into a smartphone also suggests a potential for multimedia (cs.MM) applications. The paper also discusses the potential for real-time use, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning for feature extraction and classification makes it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
