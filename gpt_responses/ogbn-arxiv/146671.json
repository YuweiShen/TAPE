This formulation is motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks, and infection propagation. The paper presents results for interesting classes of graphs, such as the Erdos-Renyi random graph and expander graphs with constant spectral gap. These results involve analyzing the mixing time of the graph and the number of non-adaptive tests required to identify defective items. Therefore, the paper is likely to be classified under cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
