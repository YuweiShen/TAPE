The paper also discusses the use of closed form solutions and system level simulations, which are techniques commonly used in Information Theory (cs.IT) and Multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of backhaul delay, which is a concern in System and Control (cs.SY) research. Finally, the paper discusses the performance benefits of the proposed solution, which is relevant to Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
