The proposed method, Covariance Normalization, involves data-driven techniques for reducing the number of parameters in the adaptive layer, which is a technique that is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the theoretical and experimental advantages of the proposed method, which suggests that it could be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
