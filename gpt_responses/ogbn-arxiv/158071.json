The use of a recursive neural network also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the use of neural networks for feature learning could also place it in the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing).
