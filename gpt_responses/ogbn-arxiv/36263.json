The use of pilot-assisted transmission and channel estimation also falls under the category of signal processing and control (cs.SY). The optimization of energy efficiency and the use of diversity branches are related to networked systems and optimization (cs.NI). Finally, the use of bounds and comparisons between different transmission strategies involves mathematical modeling and analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
