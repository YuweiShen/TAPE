The paper leverages the interpretation of the alternating-minimization algorithm for dictionary learning as an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to develop auto-encoders. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an architecture for CDL that uses auto-encoders and back-propagation to simultaneously train the dictionary and regularization parameter. This is a machine learning problem that falls under the scope of cs.LG.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper applies the proposed architecture to spike sorting, which is a problem of identifying the time of occurrence of neural action potentials in recordings of electrical activity from the brain. This is a computer vision problem that falls under the scope of cs.CV.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes an encoder that is a variant of residual and recurrent neural networks. This falls under the scope of cs.NE.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an architecture that draws connections between CDL and neural networks. This is an artificial intelligence problem that falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper leverages GPUs to achieve significant computational gains relative to state-of-the-art"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
