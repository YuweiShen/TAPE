The use of maximum likelihood estimation suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The focus on large alphabets and symmetric properties suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of specialized analysis tools suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
