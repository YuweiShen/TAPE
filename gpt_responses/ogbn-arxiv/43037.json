The paper also discusses the ability of the model to adapt to new tasks, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of binary masks to modify the weights of the network is a technique that is commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification tasks, which are typically studied in the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
