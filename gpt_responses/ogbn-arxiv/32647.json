The use of deep learning and end-to-end training also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also involves the use of uncertainty estimation and gating, which are techniques commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of optical flow suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the use of recurrent neural networks suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
