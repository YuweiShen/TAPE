This is a common problem in many fields, including information theory (cs.IT), statistics (cs.ST), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper presents a new performance measure and estimation method for this problem, which could be of interest to researchers in any of these sub-categories. However, the focus on Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds and maximum-likelihood estimation suggests a stronger connection to cs.IT and cs.ST."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
