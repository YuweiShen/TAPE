The paper also introduces a C++ library for manifold geometry with automatic differentiation and coordinate frame semantics checking, which could be of interest to researchers in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents experimental results comparing the library to existing open source packages, which could be relevant to researchers in the cs.MS (Mathematical Software) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
