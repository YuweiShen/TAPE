The use of laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) also suggests a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) and image retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the use of deep neural networks for classification makes the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category a possible fit as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
