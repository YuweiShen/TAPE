This involves leveraging a novel sampling theorem, which could be seen as an information-theoretic approach to signal processing. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with wavelet transforms on the sphere, which is a geometric object. The algorithms developed also involve rotations, which are a fundamental concept in computational geometry. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the potential use of directional spin scale-discretised wavelets for the analysis of the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This is a topic of interest in computer vision and pattern recognition, as it involves the analysis of images and signals. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): While not directly related to social networks, the paper's focus on wavelet transforms and signal processing could be relevant to the analysis of network data. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the development of new algorithms for computing wavelet transforms efficiently for large data-sets on the sphere. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
