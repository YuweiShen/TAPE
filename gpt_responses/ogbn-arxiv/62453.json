This falls under the domain of AI and machine learning.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a new method for estimating node values and uncertainties using Bayesian inference, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper specifically mentions the breakthrough results of MCTS in computer Go, which is a game theory problem. The proposed Bayesian approach to MCTS could have implications for game theory research.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is a common algorithmic technique for decision-making problems. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the convergence of the proposed methods, which is a topic that falls under the domain of control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
