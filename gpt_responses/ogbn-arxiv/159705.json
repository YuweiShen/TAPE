The experiments are conducted on a quadruped robot, which falls under the domain of robotics.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses visual feedback to provide terrain awareness to the robot and implements a self-supervised foothold classifier based on a convolutional neural network. This indicates the use of computer vision techniques.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a convolutional neural network for the self-supervised foothold classifier, which falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a method to bridge the gap between blind reactive locomotion and purely vision-based planning strategies, which involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a real-time, dynamic foothold adaptation strategy that adjusts the landing position of the feet in a fully reactive manner, using only on-board computers and sensors. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
