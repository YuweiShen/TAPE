The paper also discusses the correlation distribution among a family of m-sequences, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves trace mappings and minimal polynomials, which are concepts from algebra and number theory (cs.DS, cs.NT). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) due to its focus on sequences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
