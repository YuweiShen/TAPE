The paper also considers the nonlinearity of practical energy harvesting circuits, which is a topic of interest in the field of networked systems (cs.NI) and control engineering (cs.SY). The paper proposes optimal and suboptimal schemes for dynamic power splitting, which involves the design of algorithms and protocols for communication networks (cs.MM) and wireless communication systems (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
