This involves processing data from an immersive virtual reality environment, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of a deep neural network as the log-risk function also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the study involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it explores pedestrian behaviour in response to autonomous vehicles. Finally, the study involves statistical inference (cs.SI) as it develops a cox proportional hazard model with an embedded feature selection algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
