Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves boolean functions and optimization methods, which are common topics in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The simulation results and performance evaluation suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
