The focus on Puppet, a widely used system configuration language, suggests that the paper may also fall under programming languages (cs.PL). The use of formal semantics and SMT solvers for verification suggests a connection to formal methods (cs.FL) and computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the application of the tool to real-world configurations suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
