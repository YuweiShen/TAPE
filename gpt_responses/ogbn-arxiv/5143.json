This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed method involves the use of enhanced hierarchical CNN, which involves the use of branch networks and feature preserving blocks. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of UAVs for surface inspection suggests that the paper may also fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the focus on detecting cracks suggests that the paper may also fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
