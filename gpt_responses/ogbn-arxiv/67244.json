The use of reconfigurable antennas also involves aspects of networked systems (cs.NI) and control theory (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of finite symbol extensions, which is a technique used in machine learning (cs.MM) and the achievable degrees of freedom is a performance metric that is often used in optimization and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
