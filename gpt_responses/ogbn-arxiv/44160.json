This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new theoretic tool called polar spectra, which can be used to count the number of paths on the code tree with the same number of zeros or ones respectively. This tool can be applied to various fields such as signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed codes in wireless communication systems, which falls under the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
