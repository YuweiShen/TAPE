The paper also presents a framework for tracking error propagation and resilience properties, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses computation patterns that make applications naturally resilient, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
