The proposed scheme utilizes location information of users, which falls under the category of system design and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the performance of the scheme in terms of uplink sum rate, which is a metric commonly used in the field of signal processing and communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new performance metric to analyze the strength of the LOS interference, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
