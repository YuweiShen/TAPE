The paper also discusses the challenges of scaling stochastic gradient descent to large clusters, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC). The experiments conducted in the paper are based on image classification datasets, such as CIFAR and ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CV). The proposed technique, DANA, is based on Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient, which is a popular optimization algorithm in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a Taylor expansion and Hessian approximation, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence research (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
