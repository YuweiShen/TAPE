The paper also discusses the design and implementation of the secure container, which can be considered as a software engineering (cs.SE) topic. The use of the secure container aims to improve workers' mobility and productivity, which can be related to the system and control (cs.SY) category. The paper also involves reverse engineering and attacker-inspired methods, which can be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the secure container on the Android operating system, which can be related to the operating systems (cs.OS) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
