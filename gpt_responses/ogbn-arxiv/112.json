The use of randomized response and differential privacy suggests a focus on security and privacy (cs.CR), while the collection and analysis of statistics from client-side strings suggests a focus on databases (cs.DB) and machine learning (cs.LG). The practical deployment and properties of the technology suggest a focus on systems and networking (cs.SI), while the application of the technology to both synthetic and real-world data suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
