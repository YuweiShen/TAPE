This involves training a branching heuristic to make better decisions during the search process. The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the use of reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of AI. It may also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves the use of neural networks for function approximation. Additionally, the paper involves the use of graphs, which may lead to categorization under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper involves the development of software, which may lead to categorization under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
