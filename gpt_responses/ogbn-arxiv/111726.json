The paper proposes an efficient scheme for beam alignment using a pseudo-random beamforming codebook and spreading codes, and leverages the sparse nature of mmWave channels to formulate the problem as the estimation of a sparse non-negative vector. This involves techniques from information theory such as channel probing and estimation, and sparse signal processing. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is concerned with the design of efficient communication protocols for mmWave wireless networks, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. The proposed scheme for beam alignment involves periodic channel probing by the base station and estimation of the strongest AoA-AoD pair by each user equipment, which requires coordination and synchronization between the network nodes. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mmWave communication for next-generation wireless networks, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and low latency. The proposed scheme for beam alignment is designed to achieve a sufficiently large Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) after beamforming, which is essential for reliable transmission of multimedia content. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a scheme for beam alignment using"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
