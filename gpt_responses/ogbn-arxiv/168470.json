The paper also discusses the need for reasoning about program behaviors and verifying compilers, which suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL). The use of timestamps and dynamic store buffers to capture the effect of instruction reordering suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the accuracy of the I2E models in capturing the behaviors of modern microarchitectures, which suggests a connection to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
