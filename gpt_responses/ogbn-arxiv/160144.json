The use of feedback in the scheme also suggests a potential connection to control theory (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper may involve multimedia security (cs.MM) due to the use of encryption, and potentially social and information networks (cs.SI) if the wiretap channel is modeled as a network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
