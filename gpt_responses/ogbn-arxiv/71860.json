The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach to incorporating high-level constraints using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on datasets related to face labelling (cs.MM) and pedestrian parsing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
