Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with the security aspect of the communication system, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely category. The use of multi-antenna helpers and the optimization of the source signal covariance matrix suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the simulation results suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
