This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves mathematical techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and tangent space, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
