Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the path loss and propagation challenges of high-frequency channels, which relates to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for frequent realignment of beams, which relates to control systems (cs.SY) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
