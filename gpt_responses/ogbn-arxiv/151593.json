The experiments conducted in the paper are related to image classification, object/scene recognition, and 3D object recognition, which are all subfields of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the adaptation of generic deep neural networks (DNNs), which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel regularizer for network training, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
