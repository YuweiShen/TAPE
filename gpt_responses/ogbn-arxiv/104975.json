The use of an interpretable model of autonomy and expert explanations also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The natural language aspect of the interface falls under computational linguistics (cs.CL), and the overall goal of increasing transparency and trust aligns with the systems and control sub-category (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
