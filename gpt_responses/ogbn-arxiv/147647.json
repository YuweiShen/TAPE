The use of Lie algebra theory in constructing quantum descriptions of everyday life situations also suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.SY (systems and control) sub-categories. The discussion of encoding thoughts in neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) sub-category.
