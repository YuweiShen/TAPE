Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper proposes two methods for OLTR with list-level feedback, which involves optimizing ranking policies and predicting observed feedback through regression. These methods involve machine learning techniques such as policy gradients and deep neural networks, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
