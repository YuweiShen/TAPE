This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the testbed's emphasis on modularity and extensibility, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of open-source projects and standards, which suggests that it may belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
