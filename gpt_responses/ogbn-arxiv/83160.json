The use of oversampling techniques is a popular approach to address this issue. The paper specifically focuses on comparing the performance of different oversampling techniques, including SMOTE and its extensions, with their proposed approach called LoRAS. The paper also presents a mathematical framework to explain the success of their algorithm. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
