This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses regularization and initialization schemes, which are common topics in data science (cs.DS). The use of tensor networks for image analysis (cs.CV) is also mentioned. Finally, the paper proposes a normalized version of the feature maps, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
