The paper proposes a new feature aggregation architecture called Composite Appearance Network (CAN) to address this problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also introduces a new evaluation metric called \"Inference Error\" (IE) for tracking/re-identification error, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques, indicating that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
