The paper also discusses a co-design training procedure, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed scheme involves integer-only arithmetic, which is related to numerical analysis (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments are conducted on popular CPUs, which is relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
