These techniques are commonly studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), communication (cs.COMM), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper specifically focuses on the wireless backhaul aspect of small cells in massive MIMO systems, which is related to networking and communication. Therefore, cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.COMM, cs.SY, and cs.MM are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
