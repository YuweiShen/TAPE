Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach, which involves training a neural network to make intelligent decisions on mode selection and resource management. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. The paper also deals with system optimization and control, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper involves optimization of radio and computing resources, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper deals with edge caching, which is a subfield of distributed computing, and therefore cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
