The system is modeled as a decentralized Markov decision process (DEC-MDP), which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the complexity of the optimization problem and proposes a low complexity solution, which involves mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
