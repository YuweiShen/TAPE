This is a technique commonly used in image steganography, which falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a new randomized syndrome coding scheme, which guarantees the embedding success with probability one. This involves the use of algorithms and data structures, which falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
