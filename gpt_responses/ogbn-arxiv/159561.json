Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence techniques for image analysis, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another possible category. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques for extracting root structures from MRI images, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another possible category.
