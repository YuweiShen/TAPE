This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of these models on publicly available and proprietary data sets, which could fall under the computer engineering (cs.CE) or computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper focuses on student proficiency estimation, which is a topic relevant to educational technology and could fall under the education (cs.ED) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
