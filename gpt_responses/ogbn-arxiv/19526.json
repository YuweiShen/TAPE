This problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry and falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper provides algorithms for reporting stabbers for several shapes of stabbers, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and combinatorial optimization (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the running times of the algorithms, which involves the analysis of algorithms (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
