The paper also mentions the use of two-layer networks, which is a common architecture in deep learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses spectral analysis to study the properties of the embeddings, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
