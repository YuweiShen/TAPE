This topic is closely related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) as it involves designing and implementing software systems. The paper also discusses the use of Design of Experiments (DOE) and Taguchi Methods, which are statistical techniques commonly used in the field of data communication (cs.DC) and system optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of predictive models, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
