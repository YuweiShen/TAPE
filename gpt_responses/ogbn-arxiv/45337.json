Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also focuses on optimizing energy efficiency, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the use of semantic decomposition and hierarchical frameworks could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
