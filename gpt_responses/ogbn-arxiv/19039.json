The paper uses spectral algorithms for learning parameters of latent variable models via tensor decomposition, which is highly efficient for large data. The paper also introduces a new feature-map based approach that exploits specific properties of Binomial HMMs. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with DNA methylation data, which is related to genetics and biology. Hence, the paper may also belong to q-bio.GN (Genomics) and q-bio.TO (Other Quantitative Biology)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
