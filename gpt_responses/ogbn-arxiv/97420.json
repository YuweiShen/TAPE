Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses differential privacy, which is a topic related to cryptography and security, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves optimization problems and algorithms, which are topics related to computer science theory, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a likely sub-category.
