The paper also introduces an equalization method to resolve the problem of correlation between multiantenna combining tap values and channel impulse responses, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents analytical expressions for both equalizer coefficients and SINR, which could be considered as a theoretical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
