The algorithms presented in the paper involve efficient data structures and combinatorial techniques, which are also relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The problem of minimizing total area of point-interval coverage is related to set cover and facility location problems, which fall under the sub-category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of minimizing sum of radii of client-server coverage is related to facility location and network design problems, which are studied in the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the problem of maximizing total area of disjoint disks is related to packing and covering problems, which are relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
