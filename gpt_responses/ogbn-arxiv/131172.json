The use of decision trees for non-linear hashing is a machine learning approach (cs.LG) and the proposed sub-modular formulations and GraphCut based block search method are optimization techniques (cs.DS) commonly used in computer vision and machine learning. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on image datasets (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
