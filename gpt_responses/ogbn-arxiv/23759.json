The paper also evaluates its proposed method on sequential MNIST, Billion Words, and Wikitext, which are datasets commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces a new pruning objective that improves on existing baselines, which is a topic that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
