The use of game theory in the proof suggests that it could also belong to the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) category. The paper also involves logic and automata theory, which could place it in the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) category. The use of linear time algorithms suggests that it could belong to the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) category.
