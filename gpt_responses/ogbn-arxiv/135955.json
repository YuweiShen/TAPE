This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the effect of antenna layout on the rate performance, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents a comparative study of different precoding schemes, which is relevant to communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
