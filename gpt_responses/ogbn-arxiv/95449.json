The proposed model involves a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. The paper also proposes a hedonic coalition formation algorithm that allows the agents and tasks to take distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective throughput, and the cost in terms of polling system delay. The paper presents simulation results to show how the proposed algorithm allows the agents and tasks to self-organize into independent coalitions, while improving the performance, in terms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26 percent (for a network of five agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates nearby tasks equally among agents. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves game theory and algorithm design, which makes cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
