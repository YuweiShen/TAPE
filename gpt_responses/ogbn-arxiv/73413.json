The paper proposes a new model architecture that uses attentive residual connections to capture longer-range dependencies between words, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The model also outperforms strong baselines, which suggests that it involves some optimization techniques from neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper analyzes the attention learned by the decoder, which involves some visualization techniques from computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
