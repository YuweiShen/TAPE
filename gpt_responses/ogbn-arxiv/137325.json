The paper also uses techniques from symbolic computation (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) to develop their algorithm. Additionally, the paper involves a lot of mathematical analysis and optimization, which could also place it under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
