The algorithmic advances and runtime improvements suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of algorithms (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of differential-equation approximations and rigorous proofs suggest that the paper may also belong to the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
