This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with multi-cell networks and proposes a distributed algorithm for efficient power allocation. This falls under the purview of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a power control strategy for multi-cell networks, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with rate maximization, which is a key concern in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes a power allocation strategy that can be seen as a game between the users in a cell.
