The paper discusses the optimization of transmit precoders and reflect phase shifts to maximize the weighted sum-power received by energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for information decoding receivers (IDRs). This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the deployment of an IRS to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to serve multiple IDRs and EHRs. This involves the design of a network architecture that can support the proposed SWIPT system.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions for the non-convex optimization problem of maximizing the weighted sum-power received by EHRs. This involves the design of control systems to optimize the performance of the SWIPT system.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect signals with adjustable phase shifts to achieve a high passive beamforming gain. This technology can be used to enhance the performance of multimedia applications that require high data rates and efficient power transfer.\n5. cs"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
