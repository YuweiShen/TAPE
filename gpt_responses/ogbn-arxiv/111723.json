This involves considering human cognitive abilities and balancing accuracy and latency, which are key concerns in human-computer interaction. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a parameter estimation model to estimate worker expertise, question easiness, and answer confidence, which involves using machine learning techniques. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents two greedy approximation solutions to address the NP-hard MCQ problem, which involves maximizing the number of potentially completed questions within each batch. This involves designing efficient algorithms and data structures. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Crowdsourcing platforms involve social networks of workers who collaborate to complete tasks. The paper addresses the problem of task assignment in such networks, which involves understanding the structure and dynamics of social networks. \n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the implications of crowdsourcing for society, including the need to balance accuracy and latency, ensure quality assurance, and make efficient use of worker labor."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
