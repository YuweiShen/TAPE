The use of subspace or sparsity constraints is a common approach to reduce the search space in blind deconvolution. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely categories. The paper also involves theoretical analysis and sample complexity, which suggests the categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
