The linear programming approach used in the paper is a common technique in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The concept of Hamming distance is also relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of error-correcting codes is closely related to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the use of optimization techniques to derive lower bounds is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
