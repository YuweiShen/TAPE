The use of deep CNNs and loss functions also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The testing of face matchers on different datasets indicates a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and the investigation of potential biases in the training data suggests a focus on computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
