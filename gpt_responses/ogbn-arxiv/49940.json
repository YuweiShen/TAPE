The use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to model user behavior, which could place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category.
