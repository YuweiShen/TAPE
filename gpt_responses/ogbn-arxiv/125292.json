This is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm involves arithmetic constraints, which are often studied in computer science theory (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the algorithm, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
