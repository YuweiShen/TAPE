This involves applying nonlinear auto-regression models and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to estimate and quantify the CLPU demand increase. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with analyzing smart meter data, which can be considered a type of social network data. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a data-driven framework that involves applying nonlinear auto-regression models and GMM, which are machine learning techniques. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with assessing the impact of CLPU on distribution system design and service restoration, which can be considered a systems and control problem. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but the use of smart meter data raises privacy and security concerns that may be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a framework that involves processing and analyzing large amounts of smart meter data, which can be considered a data structures and algorithms problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
