The paper specifically focuses on the impact of spatial separation between antenna arrays on power control, which is a key aspect of massive MIMO networks and falls under the purview of cs.IT and cs.NI. The proposed max-min power control algorithm also involves control systems and optimization techniques, which are relevant to cs.SY. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of power control on spectral efficiency, which is a key metric in multimedia and communication systems, and hence relevant to cs.MM and cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
