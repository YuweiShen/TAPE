This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Multimedia (cs.MM), Augmented Reality (cs.AR), or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. However, since the paper primarily focuses on the statistical modeling of propagation channels for THz band, it is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
