The focus is on video files, which suggests a potential fit with multimedia (cs.MM) as well. The paper also discusses popularity distributions and scaling laws, which are topics commonly studied in information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the practical evaluations using numerical experiments could potentially fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
