This involves the use of machine learning techniques for accurate hypothesis ranking. \n\ncs.SI (Signal Processing) is also a possible sub-category as the paper deals with multiple-microphone recordings and the management of tied ranks. \n\nFinally, cs.SDQ (Sound and Quality) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with automatic quality estimation for ASR system combination."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
