The Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to analyze the performance of remote CSI inference given the local CSI. This is a typical problem in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the problem of CSI acquisition in wireless communication systems, which is a key issue in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for CSI inference and improves the method by employing dropout and deeper networks. This is a typical problem in machine learning.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of CSI acquisition in wireless communication systems, which is a typical problem in systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the problem of CSI acquisition in wireless communication systems, which is related to multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
