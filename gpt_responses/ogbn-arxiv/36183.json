The paper also discusses the estimation of sojourn time, which is a common problem in queueing theory (cs.PF). The use of erasure coding based cloud storages and modern network protocols like multipath routing suggests a focus on distributed systems (cs.DC) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). Finally, the paper introduces a new linear transformation technique, which could potentially fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
