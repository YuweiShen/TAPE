The proposed feedforward architectures and decentralized precoders involve communication networks and system control, which are relevant to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions implementation results on a multi-GPU system, which could be classified under computer architecture (cs.AR) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
