The use of modalities and propositional connectives also suggests Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) as likely categories. The consideration of fragments and restrictions on the logic's operators and atoms further supports these categories. The analysis of complexity also makes Computational Complexity (cs.CC) a likely category. Finally, the use of logic and formal methods in general could also place this paper in the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
