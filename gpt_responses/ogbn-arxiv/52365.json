The paper also derives closed-form expressions for the probabilities of detection and false alarm with optimal Likelihood ratio test (LRT) based decision rule, probability of error, and the capacity in the presence of inter-symbol interference, counting errors, and noise from the other sources. These are all topics related to information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of flow-induced diffusive molecular communication, which involves the transmission of information through a fluid medium. This is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper characterizes the movement of the nanomachines and information molecules using Brownian motion with positive drift, which is a topic related to systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission and detection of information using molecular communication, which is a type of multimedia communication. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper considers the problem of flow-induced diffusive molecular communication under various mobility conditions such as both transmitter and receiver nanomachines are mobile, TX is mobile and RX is fixed, and TX is fixed and RX is mobile.
