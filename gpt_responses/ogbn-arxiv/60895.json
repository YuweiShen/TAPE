The problem of sequence labeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The proposed framework involves learning representations and aggregating them using attention mechanisms, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The framework is evaluated in two practical settings, one of which involves cross-domain model adaptation, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
