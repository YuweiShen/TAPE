Additionally, the paper mentions the Widrow-Hoff rule, which is a common learning rule in machine learning and falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also discusses extending the Active Sites model, which is a type of neural network, and this falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions the B-Matrix approach, which is a type of network architecture, and this falls under the cs.SI (Systems and Control) sub-category.
