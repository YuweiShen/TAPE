It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as keyphrase extraction is useful for information retrieval applications. Additionally, the use of graph convolutional networks and neural network-based approaches suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the proposed diversified point network for generating diverse keyphrases could also suggest a potential fit for cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
