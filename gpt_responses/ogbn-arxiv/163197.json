The use of deep learning models for joint super-resolution and recognition also falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed max-mix training strategy and the evaluation of the framework on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of network bandwidth on recognition performance, which relates to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
