Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and proposal regions also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also introduces a new descriptor for landmark features, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
