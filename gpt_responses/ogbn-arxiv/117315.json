The paper discusses the application of computer vision in surveillance cameras, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also addresses the potential impacts of computer vision on criminal justice systems, which could be relevant to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. The development of specialized computer vision applications for law enforcement and the utilization of computer vision within existing public safety camera monitoring rooms are also discussed, which could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category, as it discusses the challenges of monitoring large camera networks and the potential benefits of computer vision as a system upgrade."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
