Additionally, the paper leverages previously trained networks for complex object recognition, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of StochasticNets also suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the potential application of the proposed approach in image and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
