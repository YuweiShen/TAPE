This involves formulating a chance-constrained optimization problem and leveraging recent theoretical results to reformulate the problem as a convex, second-order cone program. The paper thus involves optimization, control, and theoretical results, which are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science. Specifically, cs.SY (systems and control), cs.AI (artificial intelligence), and cs.LG (machine learning) are likely sub-categories given the focus on optimization and control. Additionally, cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) and cs.DC (distributed, parallel, and cluster computing) are also possible sub-categories given the potential for large-scale instances and efficient solvability."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
