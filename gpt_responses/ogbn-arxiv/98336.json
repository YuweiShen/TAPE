The use of coherence-based analysis further supports the likelihood of cs.SP and cs.LG. The consideration of signal parameters such as dynamic range and sparsity suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the empirical validation of the results could also place the paper in the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
