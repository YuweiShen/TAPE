This suggests a focus on programming languages and type systems.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the formalization of a reducibility argument using the Coq proof assistant, which suggests a focus on logic and formal methods.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the use of sized types to reason about termination of lazy data structures such as streams, which suggests a focus on formal languages and automata theory.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a program verifier implemented as an alternative verification-condition generator for the Stainless tool, which relies on existing SMT-based solver backend for automation. This suggests a focus on software engineering and verification.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions verifying graph search algorithms and functional data structures, which suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
