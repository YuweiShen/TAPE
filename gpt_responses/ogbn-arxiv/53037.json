The paper combines Bayesian Neural Nets (BNNs) with Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the flow of the activation map in time. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
