The paper specifically focuses on the effect of translationese on machine translation test sets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfields of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves evaluating the performance of MT systems, which could fall under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) subfield. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) subfield, as some MT systems use visual information to aid in translation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
