The paper also focuses on robotics tasks, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of raw-pixel input suggests that the paper may also be related to computer vision (cs.CV). The alternating between model-based and model-free approaches suggests that the paper may also be related to control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of neural networks and the focus on learning progress suggests that the paper may also be related to deep learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
