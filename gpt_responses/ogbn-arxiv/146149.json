This approach is evaluated on the MNIST dataset and compared to Contrastive Divergence (CD-K). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves computer vision (MNIST dataset) and information theory (stopping sets), which make cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.IT (Information Theory) possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
