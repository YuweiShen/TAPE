The use of Poisson point process and random propagation effects also suggests a possible connection to stochastic processes and statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also presents mathematical representations and integral expressions, indicating a possible connection to mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
