The method is designed for autonomous robots, which suggests a potential application in robotics (cs.RO). The use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and object-centric training loss indicates a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also mentions the importance of safe and robust decision-making, which could be related to the field of robotics and control (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
