It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as hand pose estimation is important for human-robot interaction. The use of deep learning methods suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the exploration of different training strategies could suggest that it belongs to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
