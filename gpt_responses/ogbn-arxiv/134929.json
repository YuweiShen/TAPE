This involves approximating the simulator in local neighborhoods of the parameter space using local surrogates, which can be used to approximate the gradient of the simulator. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), systems and control (cs.SY), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
