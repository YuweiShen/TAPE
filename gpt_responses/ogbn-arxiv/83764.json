However, it also mentions its applications in data sciences (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses extensions of the local optimality idea beyond standard eigenvalue problems, which could potentially fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper briefly mentions its applications in material sciences (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
