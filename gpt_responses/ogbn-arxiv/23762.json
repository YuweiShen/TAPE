The paper also focuses on the development of autonomous intelligent cyber-defense agents (AICAs), which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems engineering (cs.SE) to design and implement these agents. The AICAs will operate within complex command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) networks, which involves the use of systems and control theory (cs.SY) to ensure their effectiveness. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges associated with the development of ACyD, which involves the use of network infrastructure (cs.NI) to ensure the security and reliability of the AICAs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
