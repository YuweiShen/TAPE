The use of deep learning networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the relationship between object recognition and contour detection, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of regression and classification objectives in the bifurcated sub-network could also suggest it belongs to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of \"large-scale object classification task\" could indicate that it belongs to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
