The paper also discusses the problem of scarcity of ground truth annotations, which is a common issue in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed method involves projecting image features and semantic features into a common Hamming subspace, which is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) domains. Finally, the paper introduces an unsupervised domain adaptation model, which is a technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) to address the problem of domain-shift."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
