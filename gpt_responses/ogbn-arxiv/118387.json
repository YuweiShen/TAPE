This falls under the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of set-partitioned QAM constellations, which falls under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The algorithms proposed for designing throughput-maximizing codes involve optimization techniques, which falls under the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of the proposed codes, which falls under the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
