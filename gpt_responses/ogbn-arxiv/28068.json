The use of stochastic variance reduction methods and non-uniform sampling suggests that it may also belong to the cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category. The paper also deals with splitting objective functions and partial derivatives, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The use of monotone operators and variational inequalities suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the mention of the \"catalyst\" framework suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
