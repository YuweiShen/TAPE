The use of deep learning models also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the mention of the ChestX-ray14 dataset suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the potential clinical applications of the proposed method suggest that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
