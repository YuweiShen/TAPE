The use of deep learning models and support vector classifiers suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions multiple instance learning, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of a negative bag and the objective to learn a separating hyperplane suggest that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
