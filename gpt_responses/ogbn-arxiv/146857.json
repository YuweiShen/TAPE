This topic falls under several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.AR (Architecture), cs.PF (Performance), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.SE (Software Engineering). However, given the focus on energy proportionality and bi-objective optimization, cs.AR and cs.PF are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses a dynamic energy model, which could potentially fall under cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
