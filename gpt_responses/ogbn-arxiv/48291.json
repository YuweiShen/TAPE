This involves using an approximate probability model and implementing it as a wrapper around an off-the-shelf SMT solver or SAT solver. The paper also discusses an application to a vulnerability in differential privacy mechanisms. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), followed by cryptography (cs.CR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
