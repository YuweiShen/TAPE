This involves developing compression schemes using small and programmable compression kernels that can access and modify local parts of input graphs, which are executed in parallel by the underlying engine. The paper also discusses the use of statistical divergences and other metrics to analyze the accuracy of lossy graph compression. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
