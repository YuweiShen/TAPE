The use of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels and frequency division duplex (FDD) systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The study of achievable diversity multiplexing tradeoff and the evaluation of training and feedback protocols are related to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of i.i.d.
