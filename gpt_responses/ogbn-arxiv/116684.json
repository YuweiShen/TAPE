The paper also discusses re-ranking methods and query expansion, which are common techniques in information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of integral images and max-pooling is a technique commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses feature encoding and vector representation, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of bounding boxes, which is a common technique in natural language processing and computer vision (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
