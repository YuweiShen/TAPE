This involves introducing a novel particle filter network and a new planning algorithm over the belief representations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves learning belief representations and uncertainty-dependent policies. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it presents a new network for solving POMDPs. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) as it involves continuous control and planning tasks. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it involves state estimation and planning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as one of the tasks involves 3D navigation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
