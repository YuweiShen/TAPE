The use of compressive sensing (CS) techniques for channel estimation also suggests that cs.SP (signal processing) is a likely sub-category. The paper specifically focuses on the use of dictionary learning (DL) algorithms to optimize the sparsifying dictionary for channel matrices, which is a topic that falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of hybrid frequency-selective mmWave MIMO systems suggests that cs.MM (multimedia) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with hardware impairments and non-uniform arrays, which suggests that cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) and cs.SI (social and information networks) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
