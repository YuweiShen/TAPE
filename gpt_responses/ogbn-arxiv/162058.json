This suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Speech and Dialogue Processing (cs.SD). The paper also uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for training the keyword spotting system, which falls under the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves using dynamic time warping (DTW) as supervision for training the CNN, which could also place it under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with humanitarian monitoring, which could suggest the sub-category of Computation and Society (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
