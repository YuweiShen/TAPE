The paper focuses on introducing a framework to bound the adversary-free region in the neighborhood of the input data by a polyhedral envelope, which yields finer-grained certified robustness. This work is related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
