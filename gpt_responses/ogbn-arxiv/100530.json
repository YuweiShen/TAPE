The paper also discusses the effectiveness of differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) in mitigating these attacks, which falls under the category of privacy and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a new defense mechanism based on gradient shaping, which is a technique used in various areas of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanism on image classification tasks, which is a common application of machine learning in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
