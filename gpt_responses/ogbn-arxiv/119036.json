The method proposed in the paper involves processing images (cs.CV) and using mutual information maximization (cs.AI) to generate representations that are better suited for downstream tasks such as clustering (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks (cs.NE) in their experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
