This topic is most closely related to the sub-category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG), which is the most likely category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of SNNs for vision tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), which are also likely sub-categories. The use of activation functions and regularization techniques also suggests a connection to the sub-category of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and the use of mathematical proofs suggests a connection to the sub-category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
