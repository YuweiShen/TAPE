The paper also uses algebraic structures (forest algebras) to characterize the logical system, which could place it in the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. The paper's approach to solving the problem involves a distributive law, which could place it in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category.
