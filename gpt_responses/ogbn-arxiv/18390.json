The proposed model is designed for scenarios where cameras can be approximated as static, which is a common assumption in robotics and autonomous driving (cs.RO). The paper also incorporates scene geometry information into deep networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the proposed model is validated on datasets related to human detection and autonomous driving, which are both subfields of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
