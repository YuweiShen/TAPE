Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of encoding algorithms to improve performance, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of spatial information and patch-based methods suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as another possible sub-category.
