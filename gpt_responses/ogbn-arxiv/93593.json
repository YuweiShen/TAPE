This involves efficient redistribution of application state to a new set of processors. The paper focuses on deriving an algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from P to Q processors, organized as 2-D processor grids. This involves minimizing node contention and ensuring a contention-free communication schedule for data redistribution. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are: \n\n1. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This category deals with research on distributed computing, parallel computing, and cluster computing. The paper's focus on developing a framework for dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications executing on distributed memory platforms makes it a likely fit for this category.\n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This category deals with research on data structures and algorithms. The paper's focus on deriving an algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from P to Q processors makes it a likely fit for this category.\n\n3. cs.PF (Performance): This category deals with research on performance analysis and optimization. The paper's focus on minimizing node contention and ensuring a contention-free communication schedule for data redistribution makes it a likely fit for this category.\n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages): This category deals with research on programming languages and their implementation.
