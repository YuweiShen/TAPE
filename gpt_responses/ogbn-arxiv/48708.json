Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Data Mining). The paper also discusses the use of Apache Spark, a popular big data platform, which suggests the category cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the paper proposes a distributed implementation of the feature selection framework, which involves parallel computing and optimization, indicating the category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
