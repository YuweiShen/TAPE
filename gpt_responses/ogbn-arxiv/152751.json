This involves online learning to optimize the scheduling policy without prior knowledge of the stochastic processes that govern the channel, captured data, or harvested energy dynamics. The paper formulates this scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and analyzes the structural properties of its optimal value function. The paper proposes a novel accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to solve the scheduling problem online at a much faster learning rate, while limiting the induced computational complexity. The paper's focus on reinforcement learning, optimization, and wireless sensors suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MA (Multiagent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
