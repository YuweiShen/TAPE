The model also incorporates recurrent units for temporal cues, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The application of the model is for autonomous driving, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The model is learned from real human driving videos, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the model uses visual back-propagation for interpretability, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
