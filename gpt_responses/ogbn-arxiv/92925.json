Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel end-to-end model, which involves selecting useful and meaningful convolutional descriptors, indicating that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also relevant sub-categories.
