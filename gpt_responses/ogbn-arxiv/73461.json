The use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) also suggests that the paper could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with histopathology images, which are a type of medical imaging, and the use of segmentation masks suggests that the paper could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category.
