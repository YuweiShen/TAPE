This falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also uses techniques from formal language theory (cs.FL) and computational complexity (cs.CC) to prove some of the results. Information theory (cs.IT) is also used in the paper to analyze the entropy of certain types of words. Finally, the paper involves some results related to order theory (cs.LO) in constructing infinite words that avoid certain types of squares."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
