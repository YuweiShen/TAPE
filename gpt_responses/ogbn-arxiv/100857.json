This topic falls under the intersection of several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), computer architecture (cs.AR), and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a new receiver operation and investigates different receiver architectures, which are relevant to all of these sub-fields. Therefore, it is likely that the paper could be classified under any of these sub-categories, with cs.IT and cs.NI being the most likely due to the focus on wireless communication and information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
