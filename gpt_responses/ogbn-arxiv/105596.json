The paper discusses the feasibility of using V2X for vehicular positioning, which is a critical operation for autonomous driving. \n\n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the challenges of vehicular positioning, which is a crucial operation for autonomous driving. Robotics is a likely sub-category as it deals with autonomous systems and their control. \n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper discusses the limitations of conventional technologies like RADAR and LIDAR for vehicular positioning. Computer vision is a likely sub-category as it deals with image processing and object recognition, which are important for autonomous driving. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the challenges of vehicular positioning, which is a critical operation for autonomous driving. Systems and control is a likely sub-category as it deals with the design and analysis of control systems. \n\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the state-of-the-art positioning techniques discussed in the ongoing 3GPP standardization and points out their limitations. Information theory is a likely sub-category as it deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
