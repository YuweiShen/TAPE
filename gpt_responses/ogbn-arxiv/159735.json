The use of simplicial maps and their decomposition into elementary inclusions and vertex collapses suggests a connection to algebraic topology and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also mentions an application in topological data analysis, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and possibly also social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
