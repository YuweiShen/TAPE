Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of binary input channels, which could also place it in the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories. The use of Bhattacharyya parameters may also suggest a connection to statistical inference and machine learning, which could place it in the cs.SI (Statistical Learning) sub-category.
