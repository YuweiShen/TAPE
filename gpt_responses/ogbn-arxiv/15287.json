This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves training a policy that is shared across all tasks, which relates to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on simulated tasks, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) if the tasks involve visual inputs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
