The use of Bayesian deep reinforcement learning and the modeling of a distribution over policies suggest that the paper may fall under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses exploration and adaptation to new tasks, which are topics that are relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The experimental results on GridWorld and MiniGrid environments suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
