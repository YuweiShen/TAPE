This involves using a generic neural network architecture suitable for a wide range of problems. The problem of feature selection is a common one in machine learning, and the paper addresses it in a cost-sensitive setting. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on three datasets, including health datasets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.CE (Computational Epidemiology) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
