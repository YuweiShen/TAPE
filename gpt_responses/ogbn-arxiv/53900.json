This is a core computer vision task.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on end-to-end control for autonomous driving, which is a robotics application. The use of deep policy learning also falls under this category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep neural networks for object detection and policy learning, which are machine learning techniques.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for autonomous driving, which involves perception, decision-making, and control.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of autonomous vehicles, which is a systems and control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
