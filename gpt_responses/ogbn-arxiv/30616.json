The use of decision trees is a common approach in these fields, which suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the optimization of cost, which is a common concern in machine learning and optimization, suggesting that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the best possible approximation under the assumption that P \u2260 NP, which suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is a possible sub-category.
