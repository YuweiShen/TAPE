The paper proposes a GritNet architecture and an unsupervised domain adaptation method to transfer a GritNet trained on a past course to a new course without any student outcome label. This paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which is a common topic in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques, which is a common topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of computer education techniques, which is a common topic in the cs.EDU (Computer Science and Education) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of natural language processing techniques, which is a common topic in the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category.
