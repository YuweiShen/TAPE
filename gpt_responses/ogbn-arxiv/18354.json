It may also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it measures the deployment and use of TLS 1.3 across domains and mobile networks. Additionally, it may fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it discusses the new features and protocol flow of TLS 1.3. It could also be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as it analyzes the usage of TLS 1.3 in mobile browsers and networks. Finally, it may belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as it investigates the contribution of hosting services and CDNs to the fast uptake of the protocol."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
