This is a typical topic in numerical analysis. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): Abstract interpretation is a technique that uses logical reasoning to analyze programs. The paper may be relevant to researchers in this subfield. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new method for computing invariants in numerical program analysis, which is a topic of interest to software engineers who want to ensure the correctness of their programs. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the structure of the new domain for abstract interpretation and how it relates to the order and topology of the program. This may be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
