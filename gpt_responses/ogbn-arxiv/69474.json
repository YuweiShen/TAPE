However, the focus on scheduling and resource allocation suggests that cs.OS and cs.ET are the most likely categories, followed by cs.SY and cs.RT. The mention of \"minimal overhead\" in the abstract also suggests a potential interest in programming language techniques for efficient implementation, hence cs.PL is a possible but less likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
