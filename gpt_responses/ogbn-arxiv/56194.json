The use of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics involves control theory (cs.SY) and mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The paper also mentions the implementation of these techniques on various robots, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) if the robots are using these technologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
