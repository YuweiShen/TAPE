The paper also discusses the use of multi-patch and layout-aware techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the development of a dedicated neural network structure, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on a large-scale benchmark dataset, which is a topic related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
