Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the benefits of using pre-trained CNN models and boosting forest models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the computational and storage costs of deep learning methods, which could indicate a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
