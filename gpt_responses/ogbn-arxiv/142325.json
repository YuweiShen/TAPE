However, the paper focuses on sequent calculi and relational semantics, which are more closely related to proof theory (cs.LO) and mathematical logic (cs.LO, cs.MS). Additionally, the paper discusses the specific formalisms of STIT logics with temporal operators, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper's focus on cut-free calculi and structural properties suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
