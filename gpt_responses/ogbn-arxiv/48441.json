The paper also compares the proposed technique with state-of-the-art algorithms from literature, indicating that it belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of established tools for experimentation, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper deals with making decisions with partial data arrival, which is a common problem in data science (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the proposed technique's potential to meet real-life challenges, indicating that it could belong to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the overhead running cost of the proposed technique, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
