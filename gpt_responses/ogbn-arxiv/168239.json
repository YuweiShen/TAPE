The use of hierarchical tree-like data structures and data access patterns from fast multipole methods and hierarchical low-rank approximation of linear operators from H-matrix methods suggests that it may also belong to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), scientific computing (cs.SC), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The discussion of communication complexity and implementation aspects suggests that it may also belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
