This falls under the scope of computational engineering and science.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper describes a new collision-resolution algorithm and a fast, parallel, and spectrally-accurate boundary integral method tailored for spherical particles. These methods involve mathematical software development and implementation.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper describes the use of numerical methods to solve the equations governing the behavior of suspensions of rigid particles in Stokes flow. This falls under the scope of numerical analysis.\n- cs.CM (Computational Geometry): The paper describes the formulation of the collision resolution problem as a linear complementarity problem with geometric `non-overlapping' constraints imposed at each timestep. This involves computational geometry.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper describes a fast, parallel, and spectrally-accurate boundary integral method tailored for spherical particles, and shows weak and strong parallel scalings up to $8\\times 10^4$ particles with approximately $4\\times 10^7$ degrees of freedom on $1792$ cores.
