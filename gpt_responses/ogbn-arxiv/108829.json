The paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm for generating adversarial malware examples, which involves training a generative network to minimize the malicious probabilities predicted by a substitute detector. This approach involves using techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of retraining-based defensive methods, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE) and system and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
