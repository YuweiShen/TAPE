The method involves combining data under selection with prior beliefs, which is a common approach in statistical learning (cs.ST) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses efficient special-case and approximation methods, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
