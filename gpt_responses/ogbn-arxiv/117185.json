This involves modeling an occupant's preference relation over indoor air temperature using a scalar function, which is learned through Bayesian inference and active learning. The paper also presents an open-source implementation of the proposed framework in Python. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.HC (human-computer interaction), and cs.LG (machine learning). The paper also involves modeling with constraints and optimization, which could fall under cs.CE (computational engineering) and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
