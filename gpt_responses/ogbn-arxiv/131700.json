The approach involves designing a new structure of AG-CNN, including an attention prediction subnet, a pathological area localization subnet, and a glaucoma classification subnet. The paper falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image recognition and localization. It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for improving the performance of glaucoma detection. Additionally, it involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with medical images, and information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves collecting attention maps of ophthalmologists through a simulated eye-tracking experiment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
