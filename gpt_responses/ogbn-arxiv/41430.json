This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also mentions the potential use of FTN NOFDM in future communication systems, which could involve network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system integration (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of FTN NOFDM through simulation and experiment, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the transmission of audio or video signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
