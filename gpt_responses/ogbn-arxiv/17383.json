This involves addressing issues related to topical and temporal aspects of the content, as well as exploiting the stream of fresh Social Media content for guiding the crawler. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR), followed by Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Sound and Music Computing (cs.SD).
