This involves finding the optimal utility-privacy tradeoff, which is formulated as a min-diff-max optimization problem. The paper provides an ERM-like analysis of the generalization error and also a practical algorithm to perform the optimization. The proposed method is demonstrated with examples from facial expression classification, speech emotion classification, and activity classification from motion. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), cryptography and security (cs.CR), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
