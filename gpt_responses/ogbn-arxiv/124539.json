It also introduces a novel technique for detecting and ranking software based on the severity of the violation. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it proposes a new technique for categorizing software based on its functionality. \n\ncs.PL (Programming Languages) is another possible sub-category as the paper discusses the principle of least privilege, which is a concept often discussed in programming language design. \n\ncs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is a less likely sub-category, but it could be relevant as the paper discusses how market operators can incentivize software developers to adhere to the principle of least privilege. \n\nFinally, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is a less likely sub-category, but it could be relevant as the paper uses empirical data to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
