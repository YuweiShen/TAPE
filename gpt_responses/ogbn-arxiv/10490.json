This falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses improving robustness, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper introduces a new logical operation, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) who deal with logical reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
