The techniques used in the paper involve harmonic analysis and optimization, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), data structures (cs.DS), and signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
