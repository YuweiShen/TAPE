The problem is motivated by wireless networks, which falls under the networked systems (cs.NI) category. The paper also presents approximation algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to the data structures (cs.DS) or the algorithms and data structures (cs.DM) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the results to the antenna conversion problem, which suggests that it could belong to the social and information networks (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
