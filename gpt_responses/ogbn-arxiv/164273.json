The proposed algorithms also involve dynamic programming techniques, which are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.DM) problems. The paper also discusses the arithmetic complexity of the algorithms, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
