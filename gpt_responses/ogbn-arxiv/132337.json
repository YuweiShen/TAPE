The use of Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The fact that the paper deals with wireless systems and antenna arrays suggests that it could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The optimization of a localization efficiency function and the proposed antenna selection strategy suggest that the paper could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of Massive MIMO technology and the study of its efficiency suggest that the paper could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the numerical analysis and optimization suggest that the paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
