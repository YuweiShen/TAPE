It also uses mutual information as a measure of the effectiveness of the feature selector. Additionally, the paper could also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with the interpretability of machine learning models. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) as it uses real-world datasets for evaluation. Finally, the paper could also be classified under cryptography and security (cs.CR) as mutual information is a fundamental concept in information theory and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
