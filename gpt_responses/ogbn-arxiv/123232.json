This technique is related to information theory (cs.IT) and network coding (cs.NI). The paper also considers a more general topology with relay nodes, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and communication networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes novel schemes for improving the performance of coded caching, which is related to computer communication (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
