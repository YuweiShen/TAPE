The use of neural networks in reinforcement learning also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The ability to support the interaction of multiple agents suggests that the paper could also be categorized under multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of a 2D grid-world environment suggests that the paper could be categorized under robotics (cs.RO) or computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
