The focus on instancewise feature importance scoring suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of graph-structured factorization and the demonstration on language and image data suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
