The paper discusses the use of deep AutoEncoder (AE) networks, GANs, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for this purpose. These topics are closely related to computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), graphics (cs.GR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
