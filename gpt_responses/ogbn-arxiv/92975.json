The paper also discusses ways to predict CNN sensitivity and increase the robustness of CNNs, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments for fine-grained recognition tasks, which may fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
