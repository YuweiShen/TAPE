The paper proposes a novel projected gradient method for solving the problem, which is a popular optimization technique in the field of machine learning. The paper also extends the l1-regularized objective to the problem of sparsifying entire blocks within the inverse covariance matrix, which is a common technique in network analysis and image processing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
