This involves handling sparsity of OpenIE extractions and performing instance-level inference for relation inference. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with handling data sparsity and leveraging background evidence, which suggests sub-categories cs.DB (Databases) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for relation inference, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
