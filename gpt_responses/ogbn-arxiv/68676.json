Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the Additively Weighted Delaunay graph, which is a well-known data structure in computational geometry, and the Additively Weighted Voronoi diagram, which is closely related to Delaunay graphs. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the concept of spanning ratio, which is a measure of the quality of a spanner, and the use of algorithms to compute spanners, which are topics in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
