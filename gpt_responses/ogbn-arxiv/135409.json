Additionally, the use of stochastic variance reduction for policy gradient estimation is a common technique in machine learning optimization. The paper also touches on topics related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY), which are closely related to reinforcement learning. The use of Mujoco tasks suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) as well. However, given the focus on policy optimization and reinforcement learning, cs.LG is the most likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
