This makes it relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), computational linguistics (cs.CL), software engineering (cs.SE), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on the technical details of the cut-elimination proof, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
