The proposed method involves designing a class of monotone submodular functions, which is a topic related to discrete mathematics and optimization (cs.DS). The method also involves using side-information in the form of categorical attribute values, which is a topic related to machine learning and data mining (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes an efficient approximate method for solving the problem, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence and optimization (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
