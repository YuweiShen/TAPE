This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of meta-learning techniques to automatically design architectures, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The construction of a search space and the use of random search is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the resulting architecture, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
