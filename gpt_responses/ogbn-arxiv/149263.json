This is a common problem in machine learning and falls under the category of multi-view learning. The proposed method uses graph regularization and matrix factorization, which are commonly used techniques in the sub-fields of machine learning such as graph-based learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.SI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
