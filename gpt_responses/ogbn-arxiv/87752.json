The use of machine learning techniques to automate the analysis of video data suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also addresses the problem of tracking the object of interest, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO).
