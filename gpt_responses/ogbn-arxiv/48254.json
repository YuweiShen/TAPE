The paper also discusses the challenges of training a multitask model, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on real-time deployment suggests a potential application in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of deep learning models implies a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
