The paper also discusses the use of GANs for learning deep representations without extensively annotated training data, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the competitive process involving a pair of networks, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE) and signal processing (cs.SD).
