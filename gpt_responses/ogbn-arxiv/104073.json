The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting 3D poses also suggests a possible fit with the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The focus on robustness to partial occlusion and cluttered backgrounds suggests a possible fit with the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of a classifier to identify the range of a pose at run-time also suggests a possible fit with the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of the T-LESS dataset and the use of color images only suggests a possible fit with the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
