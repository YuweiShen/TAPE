The study of the convergence of rate pairs to a boundary point is related to network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the second-order asymptotics, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI). The numerical example provided in the paper involves coding rates, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the capacity region of a network information theory problem, which is a topic in computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
