This involves the use of the Coq proof assistant to formalize the analysis and provide a soundness proof. The paper also discusses the integration of the analysis into the CompCert verified C-compiler and the automatic extraction of the analysis into OCaml. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
