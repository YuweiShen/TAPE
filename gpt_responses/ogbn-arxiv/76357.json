The paper proposes a new loss function that can adaptively select samples for model training, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as robustness against label corruption is a security concern. Therefore, these five categories are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
