This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The problem of finding a minimum weight connected subgraph on planar graphs involves geometric considerations such as planarity and connectivity. Hence, the paper could be relevant to the computational geometry community.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with graph theory and optimization problems, which are topics within discrete mathematics.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper uses Lagrangian relaxation, which is a technique commonly used in game theory, to solve the optimization problem. Hence, the paper could be relevant to the computer science and game theory community.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper presents an approximation algorithm for an optimization problem, which involves numerical computations.
