This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the operation of a cognitive radio system that operates concurrently with a licensed primary radio system. This involves networking and communication protocols, making cs.NI a likely category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a practical transmission strategy for cognitive radio systems, which involves beamforming and power allocation. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the interference management between the cognitive radio and primary radio systems, which is a security concern. This makes cs.CR a possible category. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper applies blind algorithms for environment learning, which involves machine learning techniques. This makes cs.AI a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
