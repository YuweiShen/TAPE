The paper also highlights severe vulnerabilities that can be injected with the mutations, which relates to the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) category. The paper introduces a novel killing condition, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with the scalability of mutation testing, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
