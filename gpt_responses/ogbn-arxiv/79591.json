It proposes a domain adaptation framework to address the domain mismatch between synthetic training and real-world testing data. The proposed method uses a Convolutional Neural Network decomposition approach and a Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder to exploit a large collection of unlabeled real-world text images combined with synthetic data preprocessed in a specific way. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning and domain adaptation, which makes it relevant to other sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper deals with font recognition, which is a multimedia-related problem, making it relevant to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
