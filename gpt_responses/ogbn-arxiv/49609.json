However, since the paper focuses on the use of graph kernels to embed local neighborhoods of graphs in a continuous vector space, it is most likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The other sub-categories are also possible because they are related to the use of CNNs and graph classification, but they are less likely to be the primary focus of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
