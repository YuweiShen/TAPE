The use of kernel density estimates and subsampling also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper introduces a new method for thresholding, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
