The paper also discusses using representational similarity analysis to evaluate the similarity of internal activations of candidate networks with those of a teacher network, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses using computational efficiency to guide the search for new network architectures, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses using measurements from the primate visual system to find a network with a lower error rate, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural information processing (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
