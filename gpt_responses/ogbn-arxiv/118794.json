Additionally, it involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for recognition, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also involves the use of skip connections, which are commonly used in deep learning for image and video processing, and thus could be categorized under Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the use of proposals and linking algorithms, which could be categorized under Robotics (cs.RO) as it involves the detection and tracking of objects in a dynamic environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
