The paper also introduces a novel architecture for material recognition, which involves training a network to discover perceptual attributes, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of a large-scale database, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves training the network using an auxiliary loss function, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
