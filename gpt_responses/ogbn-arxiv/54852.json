The use of spatio-temporal analysis and feature extraction techniques suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of minimum spanning tree and linear assignment problem for data association and occlusion handling suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of features for tracking suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of kalman filter for occlusion handling suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
