This involves designing a decision logic and addressing the issue of sudden transitions between controller decisions. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Robotics (cs.RO), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Software Engineering (cs.SE). However, given the focus on learning and control in physical systems, cs.AI and cs.RO are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
