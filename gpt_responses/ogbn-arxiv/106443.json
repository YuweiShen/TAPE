The proposed method involves the fusion of different hand-crafted and deep features, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The use of constrained dominant sets (CDS) is also a technique commonly used in machine learning and optimization (cs.AI). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
