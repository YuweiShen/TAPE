The paper also discusses the engineering of new functionality in ACL2, which is a programming language and system for reasoning about computation, suggesting that the paper could also be categorized under software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of testing to improve theorem proving, which could fall under the categories of emerging technologies (cs.ET) and education (cs.EDU)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
