The paper proposes a joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector, and analyzes the effect of various system parameters on the system performance. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Communications (cs.COMM), and Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
