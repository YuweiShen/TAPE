It could also belong to the Learning (cs.LG) category as it proposes a new objective function for weight updates in neural networks. The Systems and Control (cs.SY) category is also a possibility as the paper deals with the behavior of a system (neural network) and proposes a rule for its weight updates. The Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category is relevant as the paper deals with a fundamental concept in AI, i.e., neural networks. Finally, the Computer Communications (cs.CC) category is a possibility as the paper deals with the communication between neurons in a network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
