The use of discriminative correlation filters (DCF) also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments and visualization techniques used in the paper may also relate to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
