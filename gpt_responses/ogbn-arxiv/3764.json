The paper also discusses the use of machine learning classifiers and augmentation of training data, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The datasets presented in the paper are intended for testing the evasion resistance of classifiers, which is a topic related to network intrusion detection (cs.NI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of obfuscation techniques for evading classifiers, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
