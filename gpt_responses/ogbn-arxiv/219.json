The evaluation of the system with blind participants also suggests a focus on usability and user experience. \n\n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the Finger Based Technique (FBT) prototypes can be seen as a type of robot or machine that interacts with touch screen devices. \n\n3. cs.SD (Sound) - The paper discusses the use of audio feedback in the double digit FBT model, which is related to sound and its role in interaction design. \n\n4. cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) - While the paper does not focus on cybersecurity, the development of new interaction systems for touch screen devices could have implications for security and privacy. \n\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper does not directly relate to natural language processing or computational linguistics, but the use of audio feedback in the FBT prototypes could be seen as a form of speech synthesis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
