This falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the determination of tile size for CNN applications, which is a common problem in Deep Learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DL). The use of Attention CNN for voting the most contributing tile size also involves Information Retrieval (cs.IR) techniques.
