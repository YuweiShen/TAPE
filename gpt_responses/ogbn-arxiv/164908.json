This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a deep neural network-based approach, which involves training on image pairs and incorporating principles from relative learning. This could potentially fall under the machine learning (cs.MM) and the learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses applications such as image retrieval and enhancement, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of considering the user's perception of aesthetics, which could fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
