This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) for uncovering relevant image features also falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the use of MRI data and advanced MRI markers in MS suggests a potential overlap with the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning for medical imaging also falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
