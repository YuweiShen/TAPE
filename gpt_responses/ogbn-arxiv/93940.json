Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses local search algorithms and their initialization schemes, which are topics in machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The use of isotropically random column-orthogonal matrices as a model for practical phase retrieval systems suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The asymptotic setting considered in the paper involves the divergence of the number of measurements and the dimension of the signal, which is a topic in numerical analysis, making cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the performance analysis of a specific algorithm, which is a topic in systems and control theory, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
