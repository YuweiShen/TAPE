As such, it is likely to fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel network architecture and two-step localization scheme, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed method also has potential applications in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM), as it can improve object detection in various settings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
