The paper proposes a method based on optimal control and reachability analysis to handle contact force constraints. This makes it likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also deals with nonlinear and coupled dynamics and constraints, which suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of optimal control and POMDPs suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of sampling-based methods and reachability analysis suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
