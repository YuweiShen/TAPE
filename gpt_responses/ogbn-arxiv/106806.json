This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. Additionally, the paper mentions practical tests, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category. The paper also deals with string matching and pattern recognition, which are topics commonly studied in the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) category. The paper may also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) category, as it deals with the time complexity of constructing suffix arrays and LCP-arrays. Finally, the paper may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category, as LCP-arrays are used in some machine learning algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
