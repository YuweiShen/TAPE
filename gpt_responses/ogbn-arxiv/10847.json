The limited-workspace model is a model of computation that is relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). The paper also introduces a compact representation of planar graphs, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the paper uses Kruskal's MST algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
