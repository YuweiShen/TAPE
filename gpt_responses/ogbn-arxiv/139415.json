Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses machine learning techniques to learn the Lyapunov-like functions, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves verifying the correctness of the learned Lyapunov-like functions, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.SD (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper uses nonlinear MPC controllers as demonstrators, which could relate to cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
