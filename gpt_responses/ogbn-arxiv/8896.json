The use of web-scraped data and the application of False Positive Reduction framework suggest that the paper could also fit in the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The use of Convolutional Neural Networks and Word Embeddings for encoding raw texts into grayscale images suggests that the paper could also fit in the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of image-based techniques for text classification suggests that the paper could also fit in the sub-category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the overall focus on automated classification using deep learning techniques suggests that the paper could also fit in the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
