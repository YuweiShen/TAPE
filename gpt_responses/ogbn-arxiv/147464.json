The paper proposes a regularization penalty that incorporates expert knowledge, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these sub-categories are also relevant to the topic of learning interpretable and credible models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
