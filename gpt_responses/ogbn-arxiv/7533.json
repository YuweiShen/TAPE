The proposed object representation involves the use of semantic keypoints and dense geometry, which can be perceived from raw sensor input, indicating the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of learning-based keypoint detection and shape completion, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG). The manipulation planning task involves reasoning about physical feasibility and desired object configuration, indicating the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves hardware experiments, indicating the involvement of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
