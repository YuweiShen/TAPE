Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of RNNs, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a method to improve the robustness of CNNs to similar distractors, which can be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments conducted in the paper involve tracking objects in videos, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the potential application of the proposed method in robotics, which can be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
