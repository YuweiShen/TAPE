The use of complex cepstrum and its comparison with the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT) technique suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Speech Recognition (cs.SI). The study of windowing effects on deconvolution quality and the potential use of the proposed method for voice quality analysis indicate that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Sound (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
