The paper also introduces a novel loss function and iterative scheme for clustering, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of fully-connected linear layers and feature learning also suggests neural networks (cs.NE) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
