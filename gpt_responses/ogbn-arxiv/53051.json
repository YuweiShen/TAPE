The approach involves learning a distance metric between observations based on pairwise similarity comparisons provided by an expert, and using this metric to place prior distributions on coefficients in the linear model. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.STAT), and natural language processing (cs.CL), as it addresses a common challenge in these areas: how to effectively leverage domain expertise to improve model performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
