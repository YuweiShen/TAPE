The use of interactive communication suggests a possible connection to communication complexity (cs.CC) and networking (cs.NI) sub-fields. The mention of upper bounds for secret key lengths suggests a possible connection to coding theory (cs.IT) and error-correcting codes (cs.CE). Finally, the mention of asymptotic results suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG) sub-fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
