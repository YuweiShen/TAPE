The use of pseudo-disks and their intersections is also a common theme in computational geometry, which further supports cs.CG as a likely category. The paper also discusses algorithms and their complexity, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.THE). The use of hypergraphs and their applications in dominating set problems can be categorized under cs.DM (discrete mathematics) and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
