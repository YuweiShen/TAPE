The paper also discusses the use of strategies for controlling rule applications, which is related to the field of automated reasoning and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of nondeterministic transformations and matching with variables, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of combinators for constructing more complex strategies, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of backtracking, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
