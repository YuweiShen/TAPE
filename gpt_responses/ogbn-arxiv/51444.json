Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves the representation and manipulation of graphs, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as another likely category. The use of submodular and symmetric set functions suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as a possible category. The paper also involves graph theory and combinatorics, which suggests cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as additional possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
