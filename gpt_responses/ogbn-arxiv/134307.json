Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science, which is cs.CL. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of state-of-the-art MRC systems, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The dataset is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational complexity (cs.CC) as it requires complex reasoning and understanding of natural language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
