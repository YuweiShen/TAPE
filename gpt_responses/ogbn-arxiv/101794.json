The use of Plackett-Luce model for feedback is also a common technique in this area. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves algorithm selection, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely category as well. The use of feature vectors and the evaluation of the algorithm on synthetic and real data suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper's focus on online learning and decision-making may also make it relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
