The approach involves optimizing a criterion based on keypoint correspondence, which is a machine learning problem (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of weakly-labeled data is also a common theme in machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the learned descriptors could potentially be used for image retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
