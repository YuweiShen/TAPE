It adapts the idea of replanning via determinization, which is a popular approach in online planning in MDPs. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also introduces a novel, lazy, regression-based method for querying the agent's belief state during run-time, which suggests that it may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper deals with planning in non-deterministic environments, which may make it relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also presents an experimental evaluation of the planner, which suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with planning in partially observable environments, which may make it relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
