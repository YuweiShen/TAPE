The receiver is based on photon counting, which involves the detection and measurement of photons, making it relevant to the field of physics (cs.PHYS). The paper also uses mathematical tools such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Chernoff $\\alpha$-divergence to derive bounds on the achievable rate, indicating a connection to mathematics (cs.MATH). Finally, the paper analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the bounds, which is a topic related to control and systems theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
