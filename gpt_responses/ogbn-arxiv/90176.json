The use of abstract GSOS rules and completely iterative algebras (cias) suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and theoretical computer science (cs.TL). The specific examples of terminal coalgebras mentioned in the abstract (CCS processes, streams, infinite trees, formal languages, and non-well-founded sets) are all related to formal languages (cs.FL) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
