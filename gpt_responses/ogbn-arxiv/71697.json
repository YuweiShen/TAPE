This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper presents a tool for compressing DNA sequences, which could be useful in computational biology and bioinformatics. This falls under the scope of computational science and engineering.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the compression ratio achieved by the proposed algorithm, which is a measure of information content. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the use of binary bits for fragments of DNA sequence, which could be relevant in the context of database storage and retrieval. This falls under the scope of databases.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper mentions the running time of the proposed algorithm, which could be relevant in the context of computational complexity.
