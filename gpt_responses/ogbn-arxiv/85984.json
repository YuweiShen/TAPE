The paper also discusses the use of batch normalization (BN) in DNNs, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of residual networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the conditioning of the optimization problem, which is a topic in numerical optimization (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
