This problem is related to signal processing, inverse problems, and numerical analysis. The paper considers signals that are modeled by \\(\\ell ^2({\\mathbb Z})\\) or a shift invariant space \\(V\\subset L^2({\\mathbb R})\\), and are evolving under the action of a spatial convolution operator \\(A\\), so that \\(f_{n}=A^nf\\). This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, such as Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). However, since the paper focuses on the problem of spatiotemporal sampling and its solvability conditions, it is most likely to belong to cs.IT, followed by cs.SI, cs.NA, cs.DS, and cs.SP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
