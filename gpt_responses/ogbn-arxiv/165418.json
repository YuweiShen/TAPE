The problem also involves designing algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) for efficient patrolling. The use of maximum speeds of agents and the requirement to minimize idle time suggest the involvement of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the problem may involve the use of sensors and communication among agents, which falls under the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
