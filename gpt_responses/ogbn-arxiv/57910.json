The use of coreset techniques is a well-established approach in this area, and the paper proposes a new coreset definition that allows for charging costs that appear for every solution to an additive constant. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), social and information networks (cs.SI), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
