The proposed solution involves the use of a fully differentiable neural network (cs.AI) that learns to localize accurately and efficiently. The model is trained using reinforcement learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve simulation environments with 2D and 3D mazes, which require computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for perception and policy learning. Finally, the proposed model can be applied to a variety of autonomous systems, including robots and drones, which fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
