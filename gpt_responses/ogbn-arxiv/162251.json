This involves modifying the graph structure in a less noticeable way compared to adding/deleting edges. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method to attack GNNs using reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an adversarial attack method on GNNs, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the vulnerability of GNNs to adversarial attacks and proposes a method to attack them, which is related to cryptography and security. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with graph structures and their modification, which is related to social and information networks. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a method to attack GNNs, which are a type of neural network, using reinforcement learning, which is related to neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
