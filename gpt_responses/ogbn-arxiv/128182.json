Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves human-ML interaction, which suggests it could belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of quality metrics for interpretability without humans in the loop suggests it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of psychophysics techniques suggests it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
