The paper also proposes a Bayesian nonparametric model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of crowdsourced experiments suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.CL). Finally, the evaluation of the method using real-world query log data suggests a focus on databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
