Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel plug-and-play relation reasoning module that utilizes human priori knowledge, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper applies the proposed method to both visual question answering and cross-modal information retrieval tasks, indicating that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
