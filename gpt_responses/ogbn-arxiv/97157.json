Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. It also touches upon the upcoming Storage-Class Memories, which falls under the cs.AR (Architecture) sub-category. The paper also discusses the potential segmentation of the memory and storage market, which could fall under the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Additionally, the paper talks about the traditional storage hierarchy, which could fall under the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category.
