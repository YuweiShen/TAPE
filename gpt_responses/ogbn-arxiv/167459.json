This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI agent for scalping trading, which involves making decisions based on market data. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper proposes a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, which involves multiple agents working together to achieve a common goal. This falls under the domain of multi-agent systems.\n- cs.TR (Trading and Market Microstructure): The paper focuses on scalping trading, which involves making quick trades to profit from small price movements. This falls under the domain of trading and market microstructure.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses order book and settlement data to train the agent, which involves analyzing social and information networks in the financial market.
