This category is therefore relevant.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of counting Euler Tours, which is known to be #P-complete for general graphs. This falls under the scope of computational complexity.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): Euler Tours are relevant in the context of game theory, where they are used to model the traversal of a graph by a player.
