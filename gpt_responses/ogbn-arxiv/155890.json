This topic falls under the category of cybersecurity (cs.CR) as it involves protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Additionally, the use of technology in this context involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. The paper also discusses the need for fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety (FACTS) in the use of technology for sensitivity review, which could fall under the category of computational society (cs.CY). Finally, the paper may also touch on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) used in the development of technology-assisted sensitivity review systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
