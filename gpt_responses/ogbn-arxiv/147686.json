The system also involves autonomous and distributed stochastic self-assembly, which can be categorized under multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of the Hybrid Cube Model (HCM) and the solid-state actuation setup can be considered as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and embedded systems (cs.ET), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
