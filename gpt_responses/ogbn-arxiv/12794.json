It also presents empirical results for real and synthetic data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nIt may also belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as it deals with the optimization of a numerical objective function using coordinate descent. \n\nAdditionally, it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it proposes a new algorithmic technique for coordinate descent. \n\nIt may also fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as Lasso and its extensions are commonly used in network analysis and the proposed method could potentially improve the efficiency of such analyses. \n\nFinally, it could be classified under cs.IT (Information Theory) as Lasso and its extensions are related to compressed sensing and signal processing, which are topics within information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
