This makes cs.CC a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the correlation polytope, which is a geometric object, and provides a bound on its extension complexity. This makes cs.CG a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with the correlation polytope, which is used in game theory to study correlated equilibria. This makes cs.GT a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with graphs and their treewidth, which are topics in discrete mathematics.
