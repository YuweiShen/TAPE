The paper also discusses multihypothesis testing, which falls under the sub-category of Information Theory and Probability (cs.ITP). The use of numerical examples suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.MM). The discussion of the channel reliability function and its asymptotic expression may be relevant to the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of a generalized error bound may also be relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning and Statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
