It also mentions the use of approximately 3.5 million CT head images to train the CNNs, which is a common approach in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses deep learning techniques to train the CNNs. \n\nArtificial intelligence (cs.AI) is another likely sub-category as the system is designed to mimic the decision-making process of radiologists. \n\nHuman-computer interaction (cs.HC) is also a possible sub-category as the system is intended to reduce the workload of human radiologists. \n\nFinally, information retrieval (cs.IR) is a possible sub-category as the system involves filtering and reporting on high-confidence studies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
