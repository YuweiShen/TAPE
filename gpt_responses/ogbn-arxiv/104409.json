The use of attention mechanisms and deep self-attentive layers suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The focus on the computation of queries, keys, and values for the self-attention layer suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Computer Engineering (cs.CE) and Education (cs.EDU)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
