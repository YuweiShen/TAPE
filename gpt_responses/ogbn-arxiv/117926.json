This fits well within the scope of database systems (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The use of probabilistic data also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the mention of a design-by-synthesis pipeline suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE) practices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
