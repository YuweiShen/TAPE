The paper also presents a programming by example technology that allows end-users to automate repetitive tasks, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or programming languages (cs.PL). The paper describes a synthesis algorithm that can learn all transformations in the language that are consistent with the user-provided set of input-output examples, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
