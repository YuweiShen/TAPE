However, the paper also involves empirical evaluation and analysis of software systems (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques used in vulnerability detection. Additionally, the paper discusses the relevance of benchmark suites to real-world Android apps, which could be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
