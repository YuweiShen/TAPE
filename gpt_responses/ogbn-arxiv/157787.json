This problem is related to statistical signal processing and machine learning, which are covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely category because the paper deals with the problem of parameter estimation from limited observations, which is a fundamental problem in information theory. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category because the paper discusses the performance of $\\ell_1$-regularized least squares and a greedy estimator, which are popular methods in machine learning for sparse parameter estimation. \n- cs.ST (Statistics) is another likely category because the paper deals with statistical inference and estimation of autoregressive parameters. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is less likely but still possible because the paper applies the proposed methods to real-world datasets, which may involve social or information networks. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) is also less likely but possible because the paper discusses the sampling complexity and stability of the proposed methods, which may involve numerical analysis techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
