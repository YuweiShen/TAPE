However, the SwitchBoard corpus used in the experiments contains audio recordings of dialogues, which may justify this category. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society) is also a less likely category as the paper does not primarily focus on social or ethical aspects of dialogue agents, but rather on their coherence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
