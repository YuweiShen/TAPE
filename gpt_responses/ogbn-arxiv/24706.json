The focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of these approaches on the well-being of individuals, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of computer-aided technologies also involves aspects of cybernetics (cs.CY) and robotics (cs.RO) in terms of virtual reality and serious games. The construction sector is also related to civil engineering (cs.CE) and computational complexity (cs.CC) in terms of the technical aspects of the tools and technologies used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
