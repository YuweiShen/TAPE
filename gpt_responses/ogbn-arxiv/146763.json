The paper proposes a new algorithm for map construction by robots with non-rigid movement, which is a variant of the classic problem. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves the use of data structures and algorithms for encoding and decoding positional information, which suggests the categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves the study of the geometry of polygons, which suggests the category cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of collaborative tasks, which suggests the category cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
