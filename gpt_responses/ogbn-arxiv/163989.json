This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the trade-off between speed and accuracy, which is a common concern in machine learning and deep learning research, indicating that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of deep learning approaches also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application areas mentioned, such as surveillance and driving assistance, suggest that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of video datasets suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
