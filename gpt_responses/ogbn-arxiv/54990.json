This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of deep learning algorithms for image classification is a popular area of research in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.DL) sub-categories. Finally, the rejection of non-epithelial regions and the use of majority voting for image classification involves some level of neural network engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
