This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of deep learning models and training techniques also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The implementation of the system using drones and real-time video analysis suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and the use of technology for surveillance and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
