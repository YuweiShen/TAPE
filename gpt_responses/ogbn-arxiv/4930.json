Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a practical implementation of the system with low complexity, which could fall under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
