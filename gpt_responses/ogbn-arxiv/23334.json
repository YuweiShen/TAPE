The use of TDMS-based MIMO channel sounders is a common practice in wireless network research, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the impact of phase noise and frequency offset on the MIMO channel rank, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). The use of antenna arrays and radio-frequency chains is a topic related to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and radio frequency engineering (cs.RF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
