This involves formulating the offloading decision as a long-term planning problem and considering future data dependency. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with machine learning techniques, including deep reinforcement learning, which are used in the proposed framework. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the general area of machine learning, which is relevant to the paper's focus on using machine learning to optimize vehicular edge computing. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This sub-category deals with distributed computing, which is relevant to the paper's focus on offloading computation to edge computing nodes. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with control systems, which is relevant to the paper's focus on optimizing vehicular services. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the general area of artificial intelligence, which is relevant to the paper's focus on using machine learning to optimize vehicular edge computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
