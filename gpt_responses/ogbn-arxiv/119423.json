The method involves rewriting the sketched model into another ASP program, which is then solved using traditional methods, indicating a focus on logic and reasoning (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also includes a use-case for a database application based on ASP, suggesting a potential fit for the databases (cs.DB) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on combinatorial problems, which could fall under the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
