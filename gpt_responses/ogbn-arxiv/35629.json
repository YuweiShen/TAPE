The proposed methodology involves solving a convex program with an $\\ell_\\infty$-norm penalty combined with a quadratic discrepancy. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
