The topic of big data is often associated with database systems (cs.DB) and distributed computing (cs.DC), which are both relevant to this paper. The use of HPC also suggests a focus on computational engineering (cs.CE) and scientific computing (cs.SE). Additionally, the processing and analysis of large datasets is a common theme in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
