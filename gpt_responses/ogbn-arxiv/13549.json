The use of capabilities, access lists, and access rights also suggests a cryptographic approach to access control. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper emphasizes the distributed and decentralized nature of the proposed mechanism, which is well-suited for emerging environments such as IoT, smart city, and autonomous cars. The use of pubsub and blockchain also suggests a distributed computing approach. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the formal notions for reasoning about access, which may involve data structures and algorithms for managing access lists and access rights. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a practical and correct mechanism for access control, which may involve software engineering principles and practices for designing and implementing the mechanism. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the use of well-tested principles and practices in distributed authorization and scalable computing, which may involve database technologies for managing access control policies and audit logs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
