The paper also addresses issues related to sparse data and parameter estimation, which are common challenges in data science (cs.DS). The paper proposes new models that can address these issues without making the optimization problem more difficult, which is a topic of interest in information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
