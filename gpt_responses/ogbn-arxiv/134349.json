The paper also proposes a method to learn feature representations, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper involves transfer learning, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of CNN models and benchmark datasets suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the iterative update scheme used in the proposed method could place it in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
