This work involves program analysis and program transformation techniques, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The verification of software systems is also a topic of interest in software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method through verification experiments, which could fall under the sub-categories of formal methods (cs.FL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
