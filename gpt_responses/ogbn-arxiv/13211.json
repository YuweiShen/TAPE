Information theory is the study of the fundamental limits of communication and coding, making this category the most likely fit for this paper. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a new transmission scheme based on polar codes for use in a HARQ scheme. Communications and networking is a broad category that encompasses many aspects of communication systems, including coding and error correction. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new system for transmitting data over a noisy channel using polar codes. Systems and control is a category that includes the study of feedback control systems, which are often used in communication systems. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new transmission scheme for use in a communication system. Networking and internet architecture is a category that includes the study of the design and implementation of computer networks, which often involve communication systems. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a new coding scheme for use in a HARQ scheme. Cryptography and security is a category that includes the study of secure communication systems, which often involve coding and error correction techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
