The use of passive dynamical systems to model the propagation, patching, and filtering processes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the systems and control community (cs.SY), while the focus on adaptive strategies for mitigating multiple malware epidemics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the distributed computing community (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
