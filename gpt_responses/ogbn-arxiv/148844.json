The use of neural networks for learning a correction term suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the problem of pedestrian avoidance involves computer vision techniques, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
