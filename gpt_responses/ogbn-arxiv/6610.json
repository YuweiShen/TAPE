The proposed framework uses a flow-volume based approach (FVBA) and varying tolerance factors, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI) to detect anomalies in network traffic. The system is scalable and efficient, which involves optimization and algorithmic design (cs.SI) to identify threshold values accurately. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed system involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.DS) to validate the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
