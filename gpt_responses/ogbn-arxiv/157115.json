The paper also discusses the use of logic gates and automated design strategies, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents numerical validation of the proposed approach, which involves simulation and computation, making it relevant to the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
