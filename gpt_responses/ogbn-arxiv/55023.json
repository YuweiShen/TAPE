This is a common problem in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer science (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a method inspired by human vision, which involves variable sampling schemes and iterative re-centering of the image. This approach involves machine learning techniques and optimization, which are relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method, which involves comparing different models and analyzing their results. This falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the inspiration from human vision, which suggests a connection to the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
