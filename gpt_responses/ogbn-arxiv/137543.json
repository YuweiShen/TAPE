The use of textual descriptions also involves natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed model involves deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (cs.LG), and the use of text features to predict output weights (cs.AI). Finally, the model also involves information retrieval techniques, as it automatically generates a list of pseudo-attributes from Wikipedia articles (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
