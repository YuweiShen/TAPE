This problem is primarily studied in computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the use of graph theory (cs.DS) and combinatorial optimization (cs.GT) in solving this problem. Additionally, the paper provides a survey of the various attempts to answer this question, which falls under the category of survey papers (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
