The paper also discusses the use of bit-wise mutual information (BMI) and bit-metric decoding (BMD) receivers, which are concepts related to information theory.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The transmitter and receiver in the proposed system are implemented as neural networks (NNs), and the paper presents a fully differentiable neural iterative demapping and decoding (IDD) structure. The paper also discusses the use of joint optimization, which is a common technique in neural network training.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a trainable communication system and discusses the use of neural networks for both the transmitter and receiver. The paper also presents a method for joint optimization, which is a common technique in machine learning.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system for point-to-point communication and discusses the use of joint optimization for constellation shaping and labeling. The paper also presents a fully differentiable neural iterative demapping and decoding (IDD) structure, which is a control-related concept.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the implementation of the proposed system on software-defined radios (SDRs) and training of the end-to-end system on the actual wireless channel, which are"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
