Additionally, the paper discusses the use of keypoints for tracking objects and object parts, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses reinforcement learning to control keypoint locations, which is a topic in both machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
