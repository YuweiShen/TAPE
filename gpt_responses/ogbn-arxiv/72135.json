Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning and sub-models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of motion information, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The dataset used for evaluation is related to object detection in videos, which could also place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method in autonomous driving, which could place it in cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
