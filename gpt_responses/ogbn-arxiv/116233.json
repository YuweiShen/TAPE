Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses the use of suffix arrays and longest common prefix arrays, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper proposes an optimal algorithm, which involves analyzing the structure of the string, making it relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the algorithm, which is relevant to systems and information science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
