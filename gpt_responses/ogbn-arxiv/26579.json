The use of QR decomposition and the comparison with QR decomposition M-algorithm suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The mention of computational complexity and the use of algorithms suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of MIMO channels suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
