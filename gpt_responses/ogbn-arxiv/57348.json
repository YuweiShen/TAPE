The use of lidar data also suggests a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the design of the network architecture and the encoding of bounding boxes, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the KITTI dataset, which is a common benchmark for object detection, suggesting a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
