This involves jointly considering the spatial and temporal domains, tolerating prediction errors, and achieving low complexity. These concepts are related to multimedia (cs.MM), computer vision (cs.CV), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), graphics (cs.GR), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on video streaming and quality of experience (QoE) metrics, we believe that cs.MM is the most likely category, followed by cs.CV and cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
