The proposed approach is based on local binary feature extraction and BossaNova image representation, which are commonly used techniques in computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video representation and description, which is a common problem in multimedia. The proposed BossaNova Video Descriptor (BNVD) and BoW Video Descriptor (BoW-VD) are techniques used for video description. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with detecting and filtering inappropriate content on the internet, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed approach can be used for content-based image and video retrieval. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new approach for pornography detection based on local binary feature extraction and BossaNova image representation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with detecting and filtering inappropriate content on the internet, which is a common problem in cybersecurity. The proposed approach can be used for content filtering and parental control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
