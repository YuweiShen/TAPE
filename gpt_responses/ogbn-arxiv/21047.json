The use of minimum terminal separating cuts and expander decomposition methods suggests that the paper could belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The algorithmic nature of the paper and the focus on running time imply that it could also belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
