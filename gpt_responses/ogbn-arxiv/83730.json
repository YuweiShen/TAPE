This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Signal Processing (cs.SI), Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV). However, given the focus on graph signals and the use of joint filtering operators, we believe that cs.SI is the most likely sub-category. The other sub-categories are also relevant due to the applications and datasets used in the paper, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification (cs.CV), still-video inpainting (cs.CV), and source localization in seismic events (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
