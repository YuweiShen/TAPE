It also involves the distribution of goods among agents, which can be modeled using data structures (cs.DS). The design of a truthful auction involves the use of algorithms and optimization techniques (cs.AI). The concept of social welfare and approximation ratios is also related to economics and mechanism design (cs.EC). Finally, the use of budgets and valuation functions involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
