The paper also discusses the construction of capacity outer-bounds, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of single user detection, which is a technique used in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the capacity of channels with mixed interference, which is a topic in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the capacity of discrete memoryless channels, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
