Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of occlusion, which is a common challenge in robotics and autonomous systems, making cs.RO (Robotics) a likely sub-category as well. The use of deep neural networks also suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a possible sub-category. The paper also proposes a modification to the standard cross-entropy loss, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the validation of the results on a newly generated dataset suggests that cs.GR (Graphics) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
