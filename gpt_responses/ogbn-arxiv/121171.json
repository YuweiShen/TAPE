This is a fundamental problem in information theory, and the paper's approach involves coding and modulation techniques that are commonly studied in this subfield. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the construction of a lattice code that can absorb ill-conditioned channel realizations. This involves designing a lattice with desirable properties, which can be a computationally complex task. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly discuss social or information networks, but the techniques used in the paper may have applications in network coding and distributed communication systems. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper's focus is on coding and modulation techniques for wireless communication channels, which is a topic of interest in the networking and internet architecture subfield. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper's approach involves using a discrete Gaussian distribution over lattice points to shape the constellation. This involves designing efficient algorithms for sampling from the discrete Gaussian distribution, which is a topic of interest in the data structures and algorithms subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
