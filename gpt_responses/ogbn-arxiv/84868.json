The use of Markov chains and decision problems suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. The paper also proposes a queue-dependent policy, which involves optimization and machine learning (cs.LG), and uses a Lyapunov drift argument, which is a common tool in control theory and optimization. Finally, the paper uses stochastic coupling and state aggregation, which are techniques commonly used in multi-armed bandit problems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
