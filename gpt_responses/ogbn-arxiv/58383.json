Additionally, the paper mentions applications in movie production and virtual/augmented reality, which could also indicate the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The use of deep learning methods suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of multi-view supervision, which could suggest that it belongs to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for monocular dense human performance capture, which could suggest that it belongs to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
