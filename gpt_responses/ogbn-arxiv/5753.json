Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the Quality of Experience (QoE), which could be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
