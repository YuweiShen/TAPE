The use of maximum-ratio combining on the uplink suggests a focus on networking and communications (cs.NI). The study of the impact of line-of-sight and unequal spatial correlation on the system performance indicates a possible interest in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis of the system performance and the derivation of closed-form approximations suggest a possible focus on computer science and networking (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
