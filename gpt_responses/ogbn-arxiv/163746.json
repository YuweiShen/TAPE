This suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning methods, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of statistical methods, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses challenges in copredication, which is a topic in Category Theory (cs.CC).
