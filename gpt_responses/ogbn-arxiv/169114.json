The paper also mentions differential privacy, which is a topic in information theory and cryptography (cs.IT). The paper's focus on equilibrium selection and coordination suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of algorithmic game theory (cs.GT). The paper's use of large-scale aggregative games suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper's use of differentially private algorithms suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
