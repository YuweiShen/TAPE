The use of LP relaxations and hierarchies suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses approximation algorithms, which is a common topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
