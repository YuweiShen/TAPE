This topic is closely related to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE), as it involves improving the reliability and security of software systems. Additionally, the use of refinement types and SMT solvers suggests a focus on formal methods (cs.DC) and verification (cs.CR). Finally, the application of these techniques to microservices suggests a potential focus on distributed systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
