The paper uses techniques from convex optimization and graph theory, which are common in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses algorithms for optimizing the lower bounds, which is a topic in optimization and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI) as related fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
