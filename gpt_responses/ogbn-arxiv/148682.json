The paper proposes a sublinear-time algorithm for recovering approximately $k$-sparse signals given the magnitudes of the entries of $\\Phi x$, where $\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m \\times n}$. This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
