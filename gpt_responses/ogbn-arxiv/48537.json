The paper also focuses on fine-tuning techniques and transfer learning, which are topics commonly discussed in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of normalization and scaling schemes is also a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE) research. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
