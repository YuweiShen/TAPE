This involves numerical methods for solving systems of equations, which falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper also mentions the use of symbolic algorithms for solving polynomial systems, which falls under the scope of symbolic computation. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of graph isomorphism to organize and classify the polynomial systems that were solved. This involves the use of algorithms for graph isomorphism and data structures for representing graphs. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions the application of polynomial systems in fields of science and engineering, which may include systems and control. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper does not explicitly mention computational geometry, but the use of graph isomorphism and canonical forms may be related to computational geometry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
