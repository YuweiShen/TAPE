The paper also proposes an end-to-end deep neural network approach, which involves learning from data, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories. The paper deals with tracking moving objects, which could also place it in the cs.RO (Robotics) category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on multiple MOT benchmarks, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
