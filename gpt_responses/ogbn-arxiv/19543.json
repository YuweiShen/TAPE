Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of machine learning models to predict instance difficulty, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of weighting instances during training, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, as it deals with extracting information from text (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves the use of crowdsourcing, which falls under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
