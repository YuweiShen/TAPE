The use of network coding also suggests a possible fit in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The proposed scheme involves segmenting packets and attaching CRC codes, which could be seen as a system design and control problem, fitting in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
