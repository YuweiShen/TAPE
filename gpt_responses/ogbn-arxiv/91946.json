The experiments are conducted on image classification datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR 10, and Imagenet, indicating that computer vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category. The paper proposes a differentiable quantization procedure, which involves optimization techniques, suggesting that artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is another possible sub-category. The use of stochastic rounding and optimization of the quantization grid with gradient descent also indicates that numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NE) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) could be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
