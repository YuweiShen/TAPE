The mention of multimedia and computer vision in the abstract suggests that cs.MM and cs.CV are likely categories. The mention of databases and machine learning suggests that cs.DB and cs.LG are also possible categories. Finally, the mention of evaluation metrics and query workloads suggests that cs.IR could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
