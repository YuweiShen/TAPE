It may also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category as it discusses the formation of a distributed \"personal cluster\" of devices owned by the same user. Additionally, it touches upon Operating Systems (cs.OS) as it mentions the migration of names to different devices. The paper also involves Data Structures (cs.DS) as it discusses the merging of namespaces of multiple devices owned by the same user. Finally, it may belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as it enables users to assign their own \"user-relative\" names to their devices and to other users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
