This involves the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to summarize the functional connectivity matrix into 2 features, which are then statistically compared between ASD patients and normal controls. Given the focus on deep learning and neural networks, as well as the use of fMRI data, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
