The paper proposes a variant of evolutionary stochastic gradient descent (ESGD) algorithm for this purpose, which involves combining gradient-aware and gradient-free optimization techniques. This makes it likely that the paper could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG), as well as optimization and control (cs.SD), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
