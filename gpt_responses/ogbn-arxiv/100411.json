It may also belong to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it discusses attacks on models and defense mechanisms. Additionally, the paper mentions computer vision (cs.CV) as a potential application area for the proposed algorithm. The use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Successive Halving (SH) also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
