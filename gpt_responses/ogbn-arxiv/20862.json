The use of nonlinear mappings and chaotic functions also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper involves simulations and data analysis, which could fall under data science (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
