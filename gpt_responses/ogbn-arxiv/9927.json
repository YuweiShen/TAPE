The use of source coding techniques also suggests a potential connection to data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the experimental evaluation of the proposed method involves machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
