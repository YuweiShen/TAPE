The paper also discusses the layered nature of these systems, which involves measuring and attesting to different layers of the system, making categories such as distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY) relevant. Finally, the paper presents a formal framework for reasoning about these systems, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
