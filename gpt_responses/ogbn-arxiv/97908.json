Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes an unsupervised learning objective for clustering video sequences into temporally coherent segments, which falls under the category of unsupervised learning and could be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with the optimization of the RSD training loss function, which could be classified under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Overall, the most likely categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, and cs.AI, followed by cs.RO and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
