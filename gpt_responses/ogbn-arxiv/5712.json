This problem is primarily related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of linear minimum mean square error channel estimator and maximum ratio combining receiver, which are common techniques in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper focuses on the performance of the system as the number of antennas increases, which is a key aspect of massive MIMO (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
