The paper also proposes an achievable upper bound and a theoretical lower bound for the minimum NDT, which involves solving a linear programming problem. These aspects are closely related to information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with cache-aided wireless interference networks, which are a type of wireless network. The paper proposes a cooperative transmitter/receiver coded caching strategy and a delivery strategy that leverages local caching gain, coded multicasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain. These aspects are related to networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with cache-aided wireless interference networks, which are a type of network. The paper proposes a cooperative transmitter/receiver coded caching strategy and a delivery strategy that leverages local caching gain, coded multicasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain. These aspects are related to social and information networks.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a cooperative transmitter/receiver coded caching strategy and a delivery strategy that leverages local caching gain, coded multicasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain. These strategies involve designing efficient algorithms"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
