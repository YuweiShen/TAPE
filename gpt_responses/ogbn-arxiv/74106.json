The paper discusses the use of check-in data from Foursquare to estimate gender preferences for venues in the physical world. This involves analyzing data from various regions of the world to find significant differences in preferences for specific venues between gender groups. The paper also discusses the potential of this methodology to support studies on gender preferences for venues at different spatial granularities around the world. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
