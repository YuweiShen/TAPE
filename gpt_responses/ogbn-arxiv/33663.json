The use of short-time Fourier transform and the mention of ptychography and ultra-short pulse characterization suggest that the paper may fall under cs.SP (Signal Processing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). The focus on the number of measurements required for recovery suggests a connection to information theory, which is covered in cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of mathematical techniques and proofs suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics, which are covered in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
