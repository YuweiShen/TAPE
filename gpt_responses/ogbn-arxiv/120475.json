The use of histograms and frequency estimation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of data structures (cs.DS). The mention of error bounds and computational efficiency suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of protocols for data aggregation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
