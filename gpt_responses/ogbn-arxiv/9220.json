The paper also discusses the use of potential functions, which are commonly used in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper's focus on joint decoding of LDPC codes suggests a connection to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's use of density-evolution equations suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
