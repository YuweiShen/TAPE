The paper also proposes a formal framework for deriving optimal patching policies, which involves modeling the spread of malware in the network (cs.SI). The paper uses Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for a stratified epidemic model, which is a mathematical optimization technique (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the clustering of malware in the network structure, which is a topic related to complex systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of optimal patching policies, which involves analyzing data and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
