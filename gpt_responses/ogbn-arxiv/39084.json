The technique is agnostic to the data abstraction, which suggests a focus on databases (cs.DB) and possibly also on machine learning (cs.SI) for creating adaptive data abstractions. The paper also mentions semantics and creating comprehensive abstractions, which could relate to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
