The use of the histogram verification protocol suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), as these fields often deal with statistical analysis and verification. Finally, the paper may also touch upon data structures (cs.DS) as the authors propose a new hiding protocol."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
