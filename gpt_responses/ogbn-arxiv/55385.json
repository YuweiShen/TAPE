Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes the use of coherence vectors and global topic vectors, which are related to machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the paper discusses the inherent ambiguity of associating paragraphs with images, which is a problem in information retrieval (IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
