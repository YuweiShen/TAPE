This topic falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also involves optimization of transmit powers and surface element values, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of LIS also involves signal processing and manipulation, which falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential cost savings of using cheap LIS elements, which falls under the Computer Engineering (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
