The authors use Epipolar Plane Images (EPI) obtained from light field cameras, which is a technique used in computer graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). They also use a densely connected architecture to learn accurate 3D facial curves, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
