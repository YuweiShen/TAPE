The focus on capacities and solvability over different alphabets suggests a strong connection to Information Theory and Networking, while the lack of linear solutions and bounded linear capacities could be of interest to researchers in Data Structures and Algorithms and Computational Complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
