Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions cross-document relations, which suggests that it may fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as well. The use of messages and conditions for summarization indicates that the paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with summarizing events, which could be considered a topic in cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
