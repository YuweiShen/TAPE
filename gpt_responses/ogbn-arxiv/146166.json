This involves using contextual information about individuals and relations, which is a common theme in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves using information retrieval techniques to extract relevant information from the knowledge graphs, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper deals with knowledge graphs (cs.DB) and natural language processing (cs.CL) in the form of extracting information from text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
