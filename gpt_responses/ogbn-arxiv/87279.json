The use of Fisher potential and distillation also suggests a focus on optimization and training of neural networks, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of a ranking system for architecture search suggests a focus on optimization and search algorithms, which could also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
