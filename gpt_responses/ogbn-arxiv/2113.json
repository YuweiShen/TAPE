The paper discusses constraint-dependent measures that quantify the relative quality of alternative solutions of reasoning problems or the relative desirability of various policies in control, decision, and planning problems. These measures may be interpreted as truth values in a multi-valued logic, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-category. The paper also discusses mechanisms for the representation of complex constraints as combinations of simpler restrictions, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category. The paper also discusses relations that represent differential preferences between alternative solutions, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses structures for the representation of ignorance about the utility of alternative solutions, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) sub-category. Finally, the paper examines relations between these concepts and similarity-based semantic models of fuzzy logic, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
