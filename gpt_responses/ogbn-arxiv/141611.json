The use of feedback also suggests the possibility of studying signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) aspects of the problem. Additionally, the paper proposes new achievability schemes, which could be relevant to the field of communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
