The proposed algorithm, MEBoost, is a boosting algorithm that mixes two different weak learners to improve performance on imbalanced datasets. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data mining (cs.DM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
