The paper focuses on the computational efficiency of the proposed method, which is particularly relevant for large data sets. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which are also related to machine learning and data analysis. Additionally, the paper mentions nonparametric testing and statistical power, which are relevant to cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
