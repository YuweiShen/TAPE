The proposed approach uses Gaussian Processes classification to learn decision regions and accept measurements consistent with the operating sensor model. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning approach using Gaussian Processes classification to learn decision regions for RSSI measurements. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with indoor positioning systems that rely on wireless signals, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for classification of RSSI measurements. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a real-time classification scheme for RSSI measurements, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of finding a unique sensor model using both parametric and non-parametric methods, which falls under the scope of information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
