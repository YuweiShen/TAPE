The approach involves using a generative adversarial network to consolidate old concepts and recall pseudo samples during learning new concepts, which involves image datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN) and computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the issue of catastrophic forgetting, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a concept contrastive loss, which is a technique used in natural language processing and text classification (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
