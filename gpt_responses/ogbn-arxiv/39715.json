The proposed model involves the use of flexible activation functions, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes two functional regularization methods to improve the performance of the model, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
