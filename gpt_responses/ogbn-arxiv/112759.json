It also addresses the issues of storage and computational resources, which are related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper proposes a new consensus protocol, which involves non-interactive proofs, and thus falls under the category of network protocols and algorithms (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the modifications needed for the transactional model, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
