The paper also discusses the semantics and algorithmic issues associated with computing schema mapping operators, which are topics that fall under logic in computer science (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of tuple-generating dependencies, which are a concept in database theory and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the language needed to express schema mapping operators, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
