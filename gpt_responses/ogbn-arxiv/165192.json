This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) indicates that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The mention of a new group-level emotion recognition database suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of multiple cues and the need for information exchange among features suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
