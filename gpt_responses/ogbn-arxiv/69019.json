The use of convex programs and geometric constructions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and optimization (cs.GT). Finally, the paper's focus on submodular and subadditive functions suggests that it may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
