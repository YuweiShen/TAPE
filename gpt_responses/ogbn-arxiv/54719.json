The paper proposes two algorithms for solving contextual bandit problems with stochastic rewards and known non-linear reward functions. The paper also discusses the performance bounds of the proposed algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory) due to the analysis of regret bounds, \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) due to the focus on decision-making problems, \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) due to the use of machine learning algorithms, and \"cs.SY\" (Systems and Control) due to the application of the proposed algorithms in communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
