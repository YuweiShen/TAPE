The paper proposes a novel inter-operator network slicing framework that allows multiple mobile network operators to coordinate and jointly slice their accessible spectrum resources in both licensed and unlicensed bands. This involves resource allocation, spectrum aggregation, and right sharing, which are all related to networking and information theory (cs.NI, cs.IT). The paper also formulates a network slicing game based on the overlapping coalition formation game, which is related to game theory (cs.GT). The paper evaluates the proposed framework using a discrete-event simulator, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
