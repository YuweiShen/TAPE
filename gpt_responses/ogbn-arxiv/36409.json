This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of heuristics and optimization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the impact of graph properties on system performance, which relates to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
