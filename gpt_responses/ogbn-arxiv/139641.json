The focus on quantile summaries suggests that the paper is likely to be in the data structures (cs.DS) or databases (cs.DB) categories. The use of approximation and error bounds suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The lower bound analysis involves comparisons and obliviousness to the universe, which are concepts that are often studied in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of randomized algorithms in the paper suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
