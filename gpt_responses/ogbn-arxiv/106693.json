This falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also involves the use of sparsity in the representation of state vectors, which is a common theme in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper involves the use of communication networks for remote monitoring, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also involves the use of algorithms for basis selection, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
