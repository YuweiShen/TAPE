The paper also proposes a specific encryption scheme for parallel compressive sensing (PCS), which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the proposed scheme involves the use of random permutation and measurement matrices, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
