Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the limitations of single-point defenses, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper proposes a new detection mechanism based on statistics, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also discusses the scalability issue, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper proposes a trace-driven approach, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
