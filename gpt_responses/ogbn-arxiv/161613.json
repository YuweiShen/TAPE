This involves using machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust the delivery pace of each campaign based on changing bid landscapes and price elasticity. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to optimize online ad campaigns, which falls under the scope of AI. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with optimizing the delivery of online ads to reach a wider range of audiences, which is related to information retrieval. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to learn from both offline and online data to achieve optimal performance goals. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a smart pacing approach for optimizing online ad campaigns, which involves dynamically adjusting the delivery pace based on changing bid landscapes and price elasticity. This requires efficient algorithms and data structures to handle large amounts of data. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with optimizing the delivery of online ads, which may involve multimedia content such as images or videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
