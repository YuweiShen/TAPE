The paper also proposes the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform for UAS communication, which is a common technique used in wireless communication networks. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of OFDM waveform for UAS communication, which involves information theory concepts such as spectral efficiency and reliability. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the flight control signaling requirements for UASs, which involves systems and control concepts. The paper also discusses the applicability of spectrum sharing techniques for UAS communication, which involves control and optimization of spectrum allocation. \n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the application domains of UASs, which includes exploration and transportation, both of which are related to robotics. The paper also discusses the flight characteristics of UASs, which involves robotics concepts such as motion planning and control. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper briefly mentions the need for secure communication for UASs, which involves cryptography and security concepts. However, this is not the main focus of the paper and is only briefly mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
