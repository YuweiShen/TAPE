The codes are also suitable for secret sharing, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper presents the weight enumerator, which is a combinatorial object, making it relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The codes are constructed using a defining set, which is a concept in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes a practical application for the codes, which is relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
