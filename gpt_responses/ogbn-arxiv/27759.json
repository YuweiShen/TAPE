The use of N3 rules for mapping local ontologies to domain ontologies suggests the application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The integration and analysis of data from different sources also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) considerations. Finally, the paper may also touch upon information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques for querying and retrieving relevant clinical data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
