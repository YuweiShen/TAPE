The paper also discusses the suboptimal nature of this approach, which could be improved through information theory (cs.IT) or machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Additionally, the paper mentions processing data patches, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
