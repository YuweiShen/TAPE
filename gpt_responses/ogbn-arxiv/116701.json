The problem is also related to graph theory (cs.DM) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The authors use techniques from graph theory and topology (cs.GT) to prove the hardness of the problem. Finally, the problem is a variant of the crossing number problem, which is a well-studied topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
