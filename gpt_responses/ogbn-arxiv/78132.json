The paper also mentions the physical image formation process and inverse rendering, which are related to computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of neural networks for self-supervised learning is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses both synthetic and real datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
