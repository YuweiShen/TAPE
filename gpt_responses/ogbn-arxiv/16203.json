The use of spectral methods and the focus on learning a flexible class of Normalized Infinitely Divisible (NID) distributions suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The application of the proposed method to NLP tasks and the use of real datasets from New York Times and Pubmed suggest that the paper may also be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The focus on computational complexity and the use of polynomial sample complexity suggest that the paper may also be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
