The paper also discusses the use of sampling to process large volumes of data, which is a common problem in information theory (cs.IT). The algorithm proposed in the paper is generic and can be applied to any cardinality estimation algorithm, which suggests that it may have applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
