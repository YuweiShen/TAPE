Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to dealing with occlusions, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
