The paper focuses on the complexities and nuances of how people engage with ML systems, which suggests a strong emphasis on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and human-centered computing (cs.CY). The use of natural language processing (NLP) technologies in the second case study also suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's overall focus on designing ML systems that are accessible, useful, and trustworthy to all suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HCI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
