The paper also discusses various kernel/attention/regularization schemes, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve training and testing models, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the speed of the models, which could be related to the use of neural networks (cs.NE) for efficient computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
