The paper also relies on potential function arguments from complexity theory and additive combinatorics, which are typically studied in the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The smoothing argument inspired by the method of boosting from learning theory suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also relies on recent results in Gaussian geometry, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DS) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
