The paper specifically focuses on convex-inducing classifiers, which are commonly used in computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the security implications of evasion attacks, which falls under the scope of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The query algorithms presented in the paper involve computational complexity, which is a topic in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions lp costs, which is a topic in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
