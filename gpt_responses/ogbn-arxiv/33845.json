The use of nonconvex surrogates and the proposed optimization algorithm also suggest that the paper may belong to the information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on signal processing and outlier detection may also make it relevant to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
