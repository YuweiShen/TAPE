The paper discusses various approaches to authorship verification, including machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in NLP. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Authorship verification is also relevant to the field of cryptography and security, as it can be used to verify the authenticity of digital documents and messages. The paper discusses the applicability of various authorship verification methods in real forensic settings, which is a key concern in the field of cryptography and security. \n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses various algorithms and techniques used in authorship verification, including feature extraction, machine learning, and statistical analysis. These are all topics that fall under the umbrella of data structures and algorithms. \n\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Authorship verification is also relevant to the field of information retrieval, as it can be used to identify the author of a particular document or message. The paper discusses various approaches to authorship verification, including text similarity measures and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in information retrieval. \n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses various machine learning techniques used in authorship verification, including support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees.
