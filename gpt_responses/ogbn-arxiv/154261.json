Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with autonomous vehicles, which suggests the category cs.RO (Robotics). The use of deep learning models suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also proposes a scalable machine annotation scheme, which suggests the category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with the security of autonomous vehicles, which suggests the category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
