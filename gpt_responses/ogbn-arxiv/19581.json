The problem involves a scalar source and a vector helper, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of a Gaussian achievable scheme and the focus on covariance matrices also suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
