The paper focuses on the use of meta-features to measure the competence of a classifier, which is a common topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The proposed framework is evaluated on small sample size classification problems, which are often encountered in computer vision (cs.CV) and data mining (cs.DM). Additionally, the use of meta-learning is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
