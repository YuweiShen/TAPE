The use of deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN also suggests that the paper could be classified under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the proposed method in photo editing and design also suggests that the paper could be classified under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The use of videos as input and output also suggests that the paper could be classified under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the optimization of the proposed method for real-time performance suggests that the paper could be classified under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
