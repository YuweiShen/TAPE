The paper also focuses on the security aspect of cognitive networks, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The two cognitive networking applications discussed in the paper, intrusion detection and network traffic classification, are related to the sub-category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the potential impact of adversarial attacks on the operations of cognitive networks, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper provides guidelines for designing secure ML models for cognitive networks, which is related to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
