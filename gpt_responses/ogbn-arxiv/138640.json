Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The approach also involves queries to NP oracles, which suggests a connection to Computational Complexity (cs.CC) and Data Structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the approach in several decision making applications, indicating a possible connection to Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
