This involves clustering low-level features extracted from ECG signals to differentiate between normal and abnormal cycles. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning approach based on unsupervised feature learning technique to reduce false alarms in ICUs.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach to reduce false alarms in ICUs by using unsupervised feature learning technique.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper may involve the use of neural networks or evolutionary algorithms in the unsupervised feature learning technique.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper may involve the use of computer vision techniques in the feature extraction and clustering phases.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper may have implications for human-computer interaction in the context of reducing false alarms in ICUs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
