The proposed method involves learning bilinear functions from data, which suggests that it may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on large-scale datasets, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a learning-based framework, which further suggests that it may fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
