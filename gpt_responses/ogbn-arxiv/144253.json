The use of mixed l^1/l^2-minimization is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.NA). The paper also involves the study of coherence parameters and restricted isometry property, which are relevant in the field of compressed sensing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
