This involves the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to extract spatial information from the images, as well as the use of machine learning (cs.LG) to construct a prediction model. The paper also deals with issues related to wireless communication (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT) in the context of mmWave networks. Finally, the paper involves the use of millimeter-wave technology (cs.MM) for wireless communication, which is a key area of research in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
