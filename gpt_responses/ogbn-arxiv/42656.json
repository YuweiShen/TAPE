This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and network security (cs.CR). The paper also involves the use of cooperative jammers and external eavesdroppers, which are relevant to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system integration (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses explicit schemes for achieving the secure degrees of freedom regions, which may fall under multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the use of multiple users and channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
