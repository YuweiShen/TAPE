The paper also discusses the use of decision feedback equalization, which is a common technique in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also deals with the construction of both SISO and MIMO ISI channels, which falls under the domain of systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
