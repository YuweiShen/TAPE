This topic falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO) and micro-electromechanical systems (cs.ME). The paper also discusses the manufacturing and material properties of these robots, which falls under the category of micro-machines (cs.MM). The robots are designed to perform tasks in biological tissues, which suggests a connection to neuroscience (cs.NE) or bioengineering (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
