The focus is on the Arthur-Merlin model, which is a well-studied model in communication complexity. The paper introduces a new class called Small-advantage Layered Arthur-Merlin (SLAM) and investigates the layer complexity of communication protocols. These topics are closely related to computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and computational geometry (cs.CGT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
