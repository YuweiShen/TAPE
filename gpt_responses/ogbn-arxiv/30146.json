The use of different modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the physical layer (cs.PHY) sub-category. The paper also considers the use of cooperative relaying and power splitting techniques, which are relevant to the networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
