This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of convolutional neural networks for image classification suggests the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The method proposed in the paper involves optimizing hyperparameters for multiple tasks, which could be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of multicriteria optimization could also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
