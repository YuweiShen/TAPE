The paper also uses state-of-the-art methods for active learning and sampling, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions object poses, which suggests the use of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses planning for solving complex problems, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
