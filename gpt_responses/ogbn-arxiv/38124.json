The paper also mentions applications in computer vision and machine learning, which suggests that cs.CV and cs.AI are likely categories. The algorithms proposed in the paper involve exploiting submodularity and data structures, which suggests that cs.DS is also a likely category. Finally, the paper mentions the time complexity of the algorithms, which suggests that cs.IT (Information Theory) may also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
