The paper also covers the fundamental building blocks of the detection system, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the recent state of the art detection methods, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). However, the main focus of the paper is on object detection, which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely category, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
