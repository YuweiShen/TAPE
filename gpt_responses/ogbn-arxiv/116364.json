This involves reinforcement learning and large-scale road networks with hundreds of traffic signals. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as they are all related to the topics covered in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
