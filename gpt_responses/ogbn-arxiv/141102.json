The proposed method involves the use of machine learning techniques such as multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) and gating, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method in terms of accuracy, which is a common metric in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
