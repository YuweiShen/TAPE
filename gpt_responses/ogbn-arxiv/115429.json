The paper also discusses the use of a sparse synthesis prior, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of maximum-likelihood (ML) approach, which is a statistical technique used in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the hardware-friendly real-time approximation of the inverse operator, which is a problem in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with the design of image sensors, which is a problem in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
