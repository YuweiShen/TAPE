It could also belong to the category of machine learning (cs.LG) because DNNFs are used in probabilistic graphical models, which are commonly used in machine learning. The paper's focus on Boolean circuits and CNF formulas suggests it could also belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of expander graphs in the CNF formulas suggests it could belong to the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
