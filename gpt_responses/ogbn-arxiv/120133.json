The problem is related to frequency-based weighting of keys, where the contribution of each key is weighted by a function of its frequency. The family of concave sublinear functions, which includes low frequency moments, capping, logarithms, and their compositions, is of particular interest. The paper proposes a novel approach to sampling keys, proportionally to their contributions, and estimating statistics from the sample using composable sampling sketches. The paper's focus on data structures, algorithms, and statistical guarantees suggests that it belongs to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DB (Databases), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
