Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of data compression, communication, and storage. The paper also considers the impact of co-channel interference and channel estimation errors, which are typical issues in wireless communication networks, suggesting that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is another possible category. Moreover, the proposed scheme involves the use of airborne radar or global positioning system to obtain the distance between the communicating aircraft, which implies the involvement of control and system theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely category. Additionally, the paper uses Monte-Carlo simulation to validate the theoretical analysis, indicating that cs.MM (Multimedia) could be another relevant category. Finally, the paper considers the specific example of large-scale antenna arrays for aeronautical communications, which suggests that cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) could be a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
