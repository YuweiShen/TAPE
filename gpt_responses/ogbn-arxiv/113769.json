The use of correlated random coding and the analysis of the continuity of the secrecy capacity suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of an auxiliary channel and the consideration of the sender-eavesdropper communication suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
