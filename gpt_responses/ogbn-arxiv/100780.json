This involves designing optimal waveforms from multiple energy transmitters (ETs) to achieve constructive combination at the energy receiver (ER). The paper proposes a new channel training scheme for achieving optimal EB gain in a distributed WET system, where multiple separated ETs adjust their transmit phases to collaboratively send power to a single ER in an iterative manner, based on one-bit feedback from the ER per training interval. This involves the use of techniques from information theory (IT) and networked systems (NI), as well as system theory (SY), multimedia (MM), and machine learning (LG) for efficient implementation and convergence analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
