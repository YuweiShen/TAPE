The authors also mention the use of band-excluded orthogonal matching pursuit, which is a popular algorithm in the field of sparse signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the numerical experiments involve solving an optimization problem, which is a common theme in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
