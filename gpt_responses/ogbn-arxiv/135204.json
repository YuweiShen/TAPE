The use of spatial diversity over UWOC links to mitigate turbulence-induced fading is also discussed. This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the performance of multiple-input multiple-output underwater wireless optical communication (MIMO-UWOC) systems. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper deals with underwater wireless optical communication systems, which is a niche area of research. This could potentially fall under the category of \"Other Computer Science\". \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with robotics, underwater wireless optical communication systems are often used in underwater robotics applications. Hence, this could potentially fall under the category of robotics. \n5. cs.PH (Physics and Society): The paper deals with the effects of absorption and scattering on the performance of underwater wireless optical communication systems. This could potentially fall under the category of physics and society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
