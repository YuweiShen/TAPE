The use of machine learning algorithms such as Graph Matching Networks also suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the behavior-based approach to malware detection, which could place it in the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category.
