It involves designing coded caching schemes and beamforming coefficients to achieve a certain degree of freedom (DoF) for the network. This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of projective geometries over finite fields, which falls under the discrete mathematics (cs.DS) category. The paper also involves the use of caching techniques, which falls under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) category. Finally, the paper involves the use of coding techniques, which falls under the computational complexity (cs.CC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
