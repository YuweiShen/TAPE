This work is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with scene text recognition. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on text recognition benchmarks, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
