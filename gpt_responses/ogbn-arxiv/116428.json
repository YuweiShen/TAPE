Additionally, the paper discusses the issue of accidental name capture in tactic languages, which is related to programming language theory (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The proposed macro system is also inspired by the Scheme family of programming languages, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses how the macro system can be integrated into other systems, which is related to programming languages and software engineering (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
