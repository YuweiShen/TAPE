This involves the study of a new scenario where users are divided into two groups based on their quality-of-service requirements. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. Additionally, the paper involves the use of coordinated multipoint transmission, which is a technique used in wireless networks to improve the quality of service. This makes the paper relevant to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of networked systems. The paper also involves the use of optimization techniques to solve a non-convex NP-hard problem, which makes it relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of complex systems. Furthermore, the paper involves the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, which are used to improve the capacity and reliability of wireless communication systems. This makes the paper relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data. Finally, the paper involves the study of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, which are a new class of wireless networks that allow multiple users to"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
