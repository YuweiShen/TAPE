The use of subgraph preconditioners and the application to Fiedler vectors suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the hope for practical fast algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
