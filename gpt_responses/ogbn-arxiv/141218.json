This involves retrieving reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities, extracting feature opinions, and using fuzzy ontology to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an intelligent system prototype that uses fuzzy ontology and rule-based decision-making to analyze sentiment in transportation and city feature reviews. This involves developing a fuzzy ontology using Prot\\'eg\\'e OWL and Java programming, which falls under the scope of AI.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves sentiment analysis of natural language data (reviews and tweets) related to transportation and city features. This falls under the scope of CL, which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves analyzing data from social network platforms (reviews and tweets) to monitor transportation activities and make a city-feature polarity map. This falls under the scope of SI, which deals with the study of social networks and their impact on information dissemination.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves retrieving reviews and tweets related to transportation and city features, and extracting feature opinions from them. This falls under the scope"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
