Additionally, the paper deals with decentralized datasets and learning algorithms, which could fall under the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The use of DNNs also suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of non-IID data on decentralized learning, which could fall under the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a system-level approach to address the non-IID data challenge, which could fall under the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
