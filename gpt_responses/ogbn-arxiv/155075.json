This involves the study of social cues and their impact on creativity, which falls under the category of social computing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural evolution, which falls under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY). The paper also discusses the trade-off between the proportion of creators to conformers and how creative the creators were, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The study of cultural evolution and the use of agent-based models also falls under the category of software development (cs.SD). Finally, the paper discusses the use of language and communication in cultural evolution, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
