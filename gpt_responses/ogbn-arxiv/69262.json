This involves designing beamforming vectors that can adaptively select active remote radio heads (RRHs) to achieve network power minimization. Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and channel state information are used in the paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a robust group sparse beamforming algorithm for multicast Cloud-RAN, which is a type of wireless network architecture. The algorithm aims to minimize network power consumption by adaptively selecting active RRHs. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a network power minimization problem in a Cloud-RAN system, which is a type of social and information network. The proposed algorithm aims to minimize the power consumption of the network while maintaining the quality of service for the users. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a three-stage robust group sparse beamforming algorithm for multicast Cloud-RAN with imperfect CSI. The algorithm involves designing beamforming vectors that can adaptively select active RRHs to achieve network power minimization. Control theory concepts such as robust control and semidefinite relaxation are used in the paper. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a multicast"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
