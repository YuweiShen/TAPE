The paper also proposes a trust model to aid in the decomposition of the planning problem, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper addresses inter-robot collision avoidance, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper proposes a trust-based real-time switching framework, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
