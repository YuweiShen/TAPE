This suggests a strong robotics focus. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper uses hybrid systems theory to derive a controller that considers safe equilibrium policies during active data collection. This suggests a focus on systems and control. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses incremental sparse Gaussian processes to define distributions that allow a robot to actively seek out informative measurements. This suggests a focus on machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's use of machine learning and robotics suggests a focus on artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While not a primary focus of the paper, the examples given involve shape estimation and gait generation, which could involve computer vision techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
