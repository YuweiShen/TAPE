The use of reinforcement learning for neural architecture search is a popular technique in the field of machine learning, particularly in the subfield of deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of custom building blocks for cancer-specific characteristics, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning for cancer diagnosis and detection, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the scalability of their approach on a supercomputer, which falls under the category of computer architecture and digital systems (cs.CR). Finally, the use of deep learning and reinforcement learning for neural architecture search is a common topic in the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
