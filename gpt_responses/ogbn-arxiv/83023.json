The proposed method involves a neural network architecture (cs.LG) that uses attention mechanisms to select relevant regions in the scene (cs.CL). Finally, the paper also discusses the interpretability of the learned model, which is a topic of interest in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
