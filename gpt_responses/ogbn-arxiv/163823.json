This involves learning a Bayesian model without explicitly positing a prior distribution over latent global parameters, but instead adopting priors over the relational structure of the given dataset. The paper also discusses how to learn such models from data, make predictions for new points via their posterior predictive distribution, and experimentally evaluate them on toy regression and image classification tasks. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these are the most relevant areas for the paper's contributions. Additionally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper involves neural networks and graph-based modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
