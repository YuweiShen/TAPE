Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the wiretap channel formulation, which is a common topic in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper mentions practical limitations and channel assumptions, which are relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper discusses optimization problems, which are relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
