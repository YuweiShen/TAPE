The paper also analyzes the complexity of policy existence questions, which involves logical reasoning and may be relevant to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The development of algorithms to solve these questions suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of constraints in access control may also be relevant to the sub-category of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
