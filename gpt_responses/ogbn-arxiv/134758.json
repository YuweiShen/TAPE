The paper proposes a method for compressing large, complex trained ensembles into a single network, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of noisy and missing labels, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
