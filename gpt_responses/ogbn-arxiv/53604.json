The paper presents a sublinear time algorithm for this problem, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The algorithm involves random sampling and spectral techniques, which are commonly used in the subfield of spectral graph theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the implications of the algorithm for property testing, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of theoretical computer science (cs.IT) and has connections to machine learning and data analysis. The paper uses numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical viability of the algorithm on real-world graphs, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of applied machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG, cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
