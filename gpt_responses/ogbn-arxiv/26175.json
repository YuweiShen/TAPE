The simulations on real-world video signals suggest that the paper may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The discussion of design considerations for measurement transmission systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on quantization and coding of measurements suggests that it may also belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
