The paper also uses a control-theoretic lens to analyze the problem, which suggests that it could be relevant to the systems and control community (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in recovering the modified host signal, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses a dirty-paper-coding strategy, which is a technique commonly used in information theory and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
