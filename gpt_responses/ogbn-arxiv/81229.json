The paper also proposes a precoding algorithm, which is a common topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses remote radio head (RRH) selection and signal splitting, which are important aspects of networking and internet architecture. The paper also considers the fronthaul power consumption, which is a key issue in C-RANs.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a group sparse precoding and signal splitting algorithm based on the majorization-minimization framework, which involves optimization and control theory.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multiple antenna RRHs, which are commonly used in multimedia applications to improve signal quality and reduce interference.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes an algorithm for minimizing the power consumption of SWIPT C-RANs, which involves computational engineering and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
