The focus on communication costs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of computer networks (cs.NI). The lower bounds on communication costs are related to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC), which are also likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
