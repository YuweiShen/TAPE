This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CR sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the roles of individuals, companies, government, and universities in the proposed blockchain framework, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CY sub-category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions data ownership, transparency, auditability, and access control as core principles of the proposed blockchain framework, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DB sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a blockchain framework for smart mobility Big Data, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DC sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of Big Data in smart mobility suggests that machine learning techniques may be involved. Therefore, cs.LG is a less likely but still possible sub-category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
