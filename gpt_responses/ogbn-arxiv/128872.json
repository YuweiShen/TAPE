The use of stochastic geometry to model the locations of spatially NOMA users suggests a focus on system-level analysis and optimization, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the consideration of diversity analysis and the comparison of different NOMA schemes suggests a focus on multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
