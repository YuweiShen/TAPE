This falls under the scope of computer science and game theory.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the physical channel access issue in D2D communication links and proposes a pricing strategy to maximize the total D2D throughput. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper proposes a game model to allocate resources among the D2D links, which can be seen as a social network.
