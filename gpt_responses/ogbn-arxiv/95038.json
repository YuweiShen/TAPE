The proposed method involves disentangling the common and separate parts of the domains, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a mask to focus attention on desired augmentation is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely to be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
