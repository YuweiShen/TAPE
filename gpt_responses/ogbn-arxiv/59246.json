The proposed solution involves optimizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR), which are both commonly used metrics in communication systems. The paper also discusses the selection of base stations, which is a topic in system optimization (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of angle-spreading-ranges (ASR) overlap, which is a specific issue in massive MIMO systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
