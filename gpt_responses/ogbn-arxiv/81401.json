The use of Deep Learning methods for classification suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The focus on mobile phone applications and the need for countermeasures suggest that the paper may also belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY) categories.
