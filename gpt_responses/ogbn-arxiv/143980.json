The paper develops a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and an achievable secrecy rate region, which are key concepts in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper focuses on security and privacy systems in wireless data networks, which is a key area of research in cryptography and security. The paper develops a secrecy capacity region for a multi-antenna Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages, which is a fundamental problem in cryptography and security. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with wireless data networks, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. The paper focuses on the problem of secret communication over a Gaussian broadcast channel, which is a key problem in wireless networking. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with communication over wireless networks, which is a key area of research in social and information networks. The paper focuses on the problem of secret communication over a Gaussian broadcast channel, which is a key problem in social and information networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with communication over wireless networks, which is a key area of research in multimedia.
