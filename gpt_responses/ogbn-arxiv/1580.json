The proposed solution involves the use of attention and neural networks, which are also common topics in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions two specific tasks, neural machine translation and text summarization, which are often studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
