Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a method to fuse instance and semantic segmentations, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also deals with surveillance data, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of state-of-the-art detectors, which may involve security and cryptography, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
