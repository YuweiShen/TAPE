The proposed solution involves combining physical secure coding with machine learning, which falls under the intersection of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of hidden Markov models for eavesdropper behavior pattern learning also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
