It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the proposed method can be applied to autonomous driving and robotics applications. Additionally, the use of deep learning techniques for proposal generation and box prediction suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the method in terms of Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
