The use of batch optimization and the comparison to stochastic approaches suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The focus on efficiency and resource constraints may also suggest a connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the use of optimization techniques may also suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
