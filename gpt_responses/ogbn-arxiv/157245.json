The paper proposes a novel method for generating and applying hierarchical, dynamic topic-based language models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also proposes new techniques for cluster generation, hierarchical smoothing, and adaptive topic-probability estimation, which involve machine learning and statistical modeling. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper evaluates its proposed method on the Broadcast News corpus, which involves information retrieval and text classification. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
