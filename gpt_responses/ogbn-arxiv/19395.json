The use of a test statistic and asymptotic methods suggests a statistical focus, which could fall under the sub-categories of statistics (cs.ST) or systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of \"search for an alternate model\" suggests a focus on optimization or search algorithms, which could fall under the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
