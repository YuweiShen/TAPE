The proposed definition of \"information\" is based on Kolmogorov's Complexity Theory and Chaitin's Algorithmic Information, which are concepts commonly used in the field of computational neuroscience (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the challenges of modeling human visual information processing, which is a topic that falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the revision of traditional dogmas in brain information processing research could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
