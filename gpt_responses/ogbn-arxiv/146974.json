It also involves information theory (cs.IT) as it assumes known noisy channel densities and aims to optimize the denoising performance. Multimedia (cs.MM) is also a possible sub-category as the denoiser can be applied to various types of data, including images and videos. Finally, neural networks (cs.NE) is another possible sub-category as the proposed algorithm is based on a neural network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
