Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also mentions the use of an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, which is commonly used in compressed sensing, indicating a possible connection to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses lattice reduction, which is a technique used in cryptography, suggesting a possible connection to cs.SI (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper deals with signal processing and optimization, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
