This is a problem commonly encountered in information retrieval (IR), which falls under the cs.IR sub-category. The paper also involves data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB) as it proposes a method for partitioning datasets and building hash indexes. The use of LSH also falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
