Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and computational complexity, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions network coding, which falls under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
