The use of nonconvex optimization techniques and the study of the null space of the measurement matrix suggest a numerical analysis (cs.NA) perspective. The topological viewpoint and the study of sets of measure zero and first category suggest a topology (cs.SI) perspective. Finally, the comparison of different cost functions suggests a data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
