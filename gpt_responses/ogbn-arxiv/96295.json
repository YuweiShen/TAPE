The use of numerical methods for handling nonlinearity suggests relevance to cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on correctness-critical applications such as formal verification and theorem proving suggests relevance to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The mention of Lipschitz-continuous ODEs suggests relevance to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
