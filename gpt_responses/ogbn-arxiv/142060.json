Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication and information processing. The paper also discusses the transmission process in millimeter-wave-band communications, which falls under the category of cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper proposes channel estimation strategies that exploit the sparsity of the channel in the angle and delay domains, which is a topic of interest in cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper focuses on the spatial- and frequency-wideband effects in massive MIMO systems, which is a topic of interest in cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
