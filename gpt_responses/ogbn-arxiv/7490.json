This makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) the most likely category. The paper also deals with optimization problems that can be encoded as Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MIPs), which suggests categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of cutting planes solution approach and iterative constraint addition suggests categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
