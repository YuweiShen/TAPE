It involves the use of dynamic logic modalities and cooperation modalities to reason about the effects of control transfer on the abilities of agents and coalitions. This topic is relevant to several areas of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), game theory (cs.GT), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
