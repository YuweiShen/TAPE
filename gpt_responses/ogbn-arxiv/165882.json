Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Neural networks are used in the implementation, so neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) is also a possible category. Finally, information retrieval (cs.IR) could be relevant as the paper deals with combining information from multiple sources."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
