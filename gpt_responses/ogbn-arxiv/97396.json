This approach involves the use of a five-dimensional kernel obtained as the fundamental solution of the Fokker-Planck equation modelling the cortical connectivity in the lifted space of positions, orientations, curvatures and intensity. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers topics related to computer vision, image processing, and pattern recognition, which are all relevant to the proposed approach for segmenting and tracking curvilinear structures in retinal images.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers topics related to neural networks and machine learning, which are also relevant to the proposed approach inspired by the geometry of the primary visual cortex.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, which is relevant to the proposed approach that involves the use of a contextual affinity matrix and self-tuning spectral clustering.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to artificial intelligence, which is relevant to the proposed approach that involves the use of a novel method for segmenting and tracking curvilinear structures in retinal images.\n- cs.IT"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
