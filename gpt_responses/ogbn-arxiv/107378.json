The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models to predict relevance, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the practical applications of their proposed model, which could fall under the categories of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and computational linguistics (cs.CL).
