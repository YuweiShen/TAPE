The use of multiple antennas for secure broadcast channels suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the focus on security and privacy systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of wireless networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The consideration of achievable rate regions and numerical examples suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of multi-antenna systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
