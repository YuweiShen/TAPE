The paper also discusses multi-task learning (MTL) and meta-learning, which are both subfields of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of unsupervised clustering to construct auxiliary tasks is related to unsupervised learning (cs.AI) and clustering (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for multi-task learning, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
