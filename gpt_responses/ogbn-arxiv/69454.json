Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) further supports this categorization. The paper also involves the use of statistical features, which could potentially place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The focus on training the CNN on shadow examples suggests a connection to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. The application of the proposed method to robotic systems could place it in the Robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the use of benchmark datasets and the potential for real-world applications could also place this paper in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
