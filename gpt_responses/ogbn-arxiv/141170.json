It also involves the use of multiple instance learning (MIL) which is a common technique in computer vision. The paper also involves the refinement of instance classifiers which is a machine learning task, making categories such as Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) likely as well. Finally, the paper involves experiments on benchmark datasets, which could also place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
