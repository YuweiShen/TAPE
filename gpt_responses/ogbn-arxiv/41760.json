The paper focuses on the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, which is a popular algorithm in deep reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the application of DQN to zero-sum Markov games, which falls under the sub-category cs.GT (Game Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
