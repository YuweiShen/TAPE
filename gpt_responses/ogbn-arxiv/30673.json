It uses ideas from rate-distortion theory to derive bounds for the average L1 or L\u221e distance between the learned classifier and the true maximum a posteriori classifier in terms of information-theoretic quantities and the number of training samples available. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
