Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves supervised learning and classification, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of pre-trained embeddings and spectral clustering suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which could be classified under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of word embeddings and vector subtraction suggests a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
