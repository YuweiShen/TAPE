The paper also discusses transfer learning and domain-specific datasets, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Earth Mover's Distance as a measure of domain similarity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of higher image resolution, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
