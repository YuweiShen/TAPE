The paper also involves proof-nets, which are a graphical representation of proofs, and are commonly used in proof theory, falling under cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper's focus on noncommutative connectives and their extensions could also place it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these topics are relevant to certain areas of AI and data analysis. Finally, the paper's development of a sequent calculus could also place it under cs.CC (Computational Complexity), as this is a fundamental concept in complexity theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
