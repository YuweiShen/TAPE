Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.IR. The paper also mentions the use of context-aware approaches, which is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), falling under the subfield of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Therefore, cs.LG is also a likely sub-category.
