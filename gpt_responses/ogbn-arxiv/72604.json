The proposed method involves rendering of the face model from new viewpoints, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of a neural network for 3D reconstruction suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MM) and the use of supervised fine-tuning implies a focus on deep learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves the generation of synthetic data, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
