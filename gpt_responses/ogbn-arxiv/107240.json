The use of deep neural networks (DNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of regularizations in the learning process, which could indicate that it belongs to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The proposed framework could also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with categorizing large amounts of videos. Finally, the paper mentions the release of a new benchmark dataset, which could suggest that it belongs to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
