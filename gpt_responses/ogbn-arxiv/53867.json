Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of prosodic cues, which are related to the acoustic properties of speech, and this is a common area of research in the field of computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the sub-category of cs.SD (Sound) because it deals with the acoustic properties of speech and the extraction of prosodic cues. \n\nAnother possible sub-category is cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing) because the paper deals with the processing of speech signals and the extraction of acoustic-prosodic cues. \n\nThe sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a possibility because the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques for disfluency detection. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of cs.CL (Information Retrieval) could be relevant because the paper discusses the use of text-based distributional prediction to extract acoustic-prosodic cues, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
