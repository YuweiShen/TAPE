The concept of variance competitiveness is a measure of the quality of estimators, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.SI). The paper also presents a general construction of the L$^*$ estimator, which is a well-known algorithm in computational learning theory (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
