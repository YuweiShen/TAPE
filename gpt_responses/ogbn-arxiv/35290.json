The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The health applications of recognizing activities of daily living suggest that the paper may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of wearable cameras suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
