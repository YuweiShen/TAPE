The paper also mentions the use of argumentation frameworks, which is a topic in logic and reasoning (cs.LO). The extension of the system for planning also suggests a connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the computation of non-monotonic consequences, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
