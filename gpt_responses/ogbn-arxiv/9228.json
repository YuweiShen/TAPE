This falls under the purview of computer vision.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The use of genetic algorithms to solve jigsaw puzzles is an application of AI. The paper proposes a novel procedure for merging parent solutions to an improved child solution, which is an AI-based approach.\n3. cs.GR (Graphics) - Jigsaw puzzles involve images and graphics, and the paper deals with solving large jigsaw puzzles. This could fall under the graphics sub-category.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based approach for solving jigsaw puzzles, which involves designing and implementing algorithms. This could fall under the data structures and algorithms sub-category.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics) - While the paper does not explicitly deal with robotics, the use of automated algorithms to solve jigsaw puzzles could have applications in robotics, such as in assembling parts or objects. This could fall under the robotics sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
