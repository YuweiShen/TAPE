This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also introduces novel datasets and baselines for out-of-distribution detection, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and cybersecurity (cs.CR) research. Finally, the paper mentions the use of simulated driving environments, which could be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
