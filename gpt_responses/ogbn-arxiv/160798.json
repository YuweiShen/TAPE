The method involves predicting text center-border probability and text center-direction, which can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the robustness of the method to multi-oriented and curved text, which relates to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
