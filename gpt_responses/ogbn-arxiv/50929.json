The paper proposes a generic modeling framework for two sub-tasks of LBIE: language-based image segmentation and image colorization. The paper uses deep learning techniques and natural language processing to achieve the desired results. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
