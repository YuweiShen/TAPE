The use of proof nets and proof-theoretic techniques suggests a focus on logic and formal methods, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the mention of polymorphism suggests a possible connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
