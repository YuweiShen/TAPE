The paper also uses game theory (cs.GT) to model the system and evaluate the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a Markov chain to model the system, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of ZigZag decoding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
