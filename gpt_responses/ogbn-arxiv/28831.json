The paper also involves the development of a stability preserving method for comparing rank invariants of vector functions obtained from discrete data, suggesting that cs.DS and cs.NA are also possible categories. Finally, the numerical tests mentioned in the abstract suggest that cs.SI (Scientific Computing) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
