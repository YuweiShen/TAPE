This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of Gaussian codebooks and power allocation to maximize the achievable sum-rate suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
