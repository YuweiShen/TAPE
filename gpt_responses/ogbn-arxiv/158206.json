Specifically, the paper introduces Universal Successor Features (USFs) and a model for learning them, which is a novel contribution to the field of RL. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also includes experiments with two MuJoCo environments, which suggests a focus on robotics and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely category as well. Finally, the paper uses a gridworld environment, which is a common benchmark in computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
