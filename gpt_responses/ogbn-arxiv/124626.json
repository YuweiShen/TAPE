The algorithm proposed in the paper is based on sampling and optimization, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the coordination of multiple agents, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes experiments with image-based cost maps, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
