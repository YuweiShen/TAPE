It also involves deep learning models and data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. The paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories due to the use of deep learning models and optimization techniques. The paper may also be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as license plate recognition is often used in security applications. Finally, the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category may also be relevant as license plate recognition can be used for indexing and searching surveillance footage."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
