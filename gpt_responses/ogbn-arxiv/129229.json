The paper also discusses attacks on cryptographic systems that use rank codes, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The combinatorial attack proposed in the paper involves techniques from combinatorics and graph theory, which could place it under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The algebraic attack proposed in the paper involves the use of $q$-polynomials, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and algebraic coding theory, and could place it under the category of symbolic computation (cs.SI) or machine learning (cs.LG) which often use algebraic techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
