The algorithm also needs to be robust and have low error rates, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the need for security in detecting human presence, which could fall under computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of camera images suggests the use of image retrieval techniques (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
