This falls under the scope of Systems and Control.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with verification problems, which often involve logical reasoning. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of temporal logic for verification. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques for state estimation. This falls under the scope of Artificial Intelligence.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper deals with the verification of software systems, which is a key aspect of software engineering. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions the use of programming languages such as MATLAB and Python for implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
