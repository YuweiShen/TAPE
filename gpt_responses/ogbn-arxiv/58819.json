The use of quantized data and localization systems suggests that the paper may also fall under the information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the proposed detectors for identifying attacked sensors involve system-level analysis and decision-making, which could be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
