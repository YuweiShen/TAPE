It also discusses the implications of the more capable condition and cyclic shift symmetry, which are concepts in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of auxiliary random variables and optimization problems suggests a connection to signal processing and optimization (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the binary-input cyclic shift symmetric wiretap channels, which could be related to coding theory and communication (cs.CC). Finally, the paper may involve some numerical computations and simulations, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
