The algorithm presented in the paper involves polynomial-time testing, which suggests that it may also be relevant to algorithms and complexity (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.TC). Finally, the paper discusses the NP-hardness of testing fan-planarity, which could also place it in the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
