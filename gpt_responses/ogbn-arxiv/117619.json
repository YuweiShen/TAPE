The proposed method involves using word and sentence embeddings to regularize NMT models, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the issue of overfitting in NMT, which is a problem that can be addressed using regularization techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI). The proposed method involves predicting both categorical and continuous outputs, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper includes visualizations of the decoder's output space, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
