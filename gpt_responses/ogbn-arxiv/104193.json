The proposed analytical model is based on Markov decision processes, which is a common technique used in control systems and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the impact of data migration policies on hybrid memory performance, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
