The use of deep learning techniques for automatic feature extraction and recognition also suggests the paper could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed architecture on standard datasets for facial expression recognition (Extended Cohn-Kanade and MMI Facial Expression Database) indicates that the paper could also be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the potential applications of automatic facial expression recognition in human-computer interaction and safety systems suggest that the paper could also be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
