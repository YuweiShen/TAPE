Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses training methods and optimization techniques, which are common topics in the sub-categories of machine learning such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and real-time/mobile systems (cs.SY), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
