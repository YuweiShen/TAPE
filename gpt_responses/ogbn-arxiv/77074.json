This involves innovations in memory architecture and optimization opportunities such as address compression and continuous requests combination. The paper also discusses the challenges faced by the current memory system in the era of multi-core and big data. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AR (Architecture), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, cs.PF (Performance) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems) are also possible sub-categories as the paper discusses system performance and energy efficiency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
