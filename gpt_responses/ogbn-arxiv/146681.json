Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). The proposed method involves statistical approximations of term information measures, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper could also be relevant to cs.CY (Cryptography and Security) as it involves information content and retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
