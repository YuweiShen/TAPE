This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's focus on data compression and indexing suggests that cs.DB and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI and cs.LG, which may be relevant for the proposed method's potential applications in intelligent air traffic management. The use of spatio-temporal data structures also suggests cs.DS as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
