The paper also proposes a deep learning-based approach, which is a common technique used in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper evaluates its method on synthetic and real-world stereo datasets, which is a common practice in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a \"learning-to-adapt\" framework that enables deep stereo methods to continuously adapt to new target domains in an unsupervised manner. This involves incorporating the adaptation procedure into the learning objective to obtain a base set of parameters that are better suited for unsupervised online adaptation. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as stereo depth estimation is an important problem in robotics, especially for applications such as autonomous driving. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a method that enables deep stereo methods to adapt to new target domains in an unsupervised manner, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence research. \n\nFinally, the paper may belong to the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR) sub-category as it proposes a deep learning-based approach for stereo depth estimation, which is a common problem in computer vision"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
