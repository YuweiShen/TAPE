The paper proposes a new method for regularization of network behavior, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on image classification tasks, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the impact of activation functions on catastrophic forgetting, which is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing tasks, which is a subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
