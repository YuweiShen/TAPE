The use of ARBAC, a model for role-based access control, also suggests a focus on security. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computers and society, as it deals with access control policies for a large multinational bank, which has implications for privacy, accountability, and governance. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks, as it deals with access control policies for a large organization with multiple branches, which may involve complex social and information networks. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning, as it discusses the design of a policy using ARBAC, which involves the use of rules and logic, and may have implications for automated decision-making. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms, as it discusses the design of a policy using ARBAC, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms for access control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
