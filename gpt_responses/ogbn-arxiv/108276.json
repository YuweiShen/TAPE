The use of implicit regularization techniques and optimization methods also suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed method to augmented reality, which is a topic related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper provides implementations to facilitate reproducibility and public benchmarking, which is a common practice in the machine learning community (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
