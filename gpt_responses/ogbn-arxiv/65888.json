The paper discusses the challenges of mapping a multi-way Theta-join query to a number of MapReduce jobs and having them executed in a well-scheduled sequence to minimize the total processing time span. This work is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), distributed computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), data mining (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
