However, given the focus on scanning and filtering noisy random fields, as well as the mention of applications such as restoration and coding of noisy images, it is likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
