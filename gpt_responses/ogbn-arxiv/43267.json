Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the library is suitable for learning with high-dimensional data, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The library also provides regular and sparse online learning algorithms, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
