The proposed algorithm involves statistical methods (Parzen-Rosenblatt window, EM method) and regularization techniques (PDE), which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions numerical experiments, which suggests that it involves some form of computational modeling (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
