The proposed framework deals with driving datasets, which can be considered as visual data, and aims to extract meaningful primitives from it.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework that uses machine learning techniques to automatically label and index heterogeneous traffic data, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but it is possible that the proposed framework can be used for security purposes in autonomous vehicles.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a framework to carefully arrange raw multidimensional time series driving data into a relational database, which falls under the domain of databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
