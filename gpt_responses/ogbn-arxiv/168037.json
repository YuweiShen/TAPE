This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of automated metrics and human judgement to quantify explainability, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of model explanations as a means of disentangling domain-specific information, which suggests that it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
