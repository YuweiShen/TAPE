The approach involves estimating co-occurrence probabilities between ground and satellite images based on a feature dictionary, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also presents a ranking-loss based algorithm that learns location-discriminative feature projection matrices, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
