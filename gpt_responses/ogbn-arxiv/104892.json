This involves the use of stochastic geometry framework and optimization techniques to find the optimum tilt angle of the base station antenna pattern. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.MA (Multiagent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
