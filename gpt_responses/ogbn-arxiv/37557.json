The paper proposes an online PQ model for ANN search, which is likely to be relevant to the computer vision community. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): ANN search is also commonly used in information retrieval tasks such as document search and recommendation systems. The paper's focus on developing an online PQ model for dynamic databases is relevant to this sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning model for ANN search, specifically an online PQ model. This sub-category is therefore likely to be relevant. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): ANN search involves searching for nearest neighbors in a large database, which is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper's focus on developing an efficient online PQ model for dynamic databases is relevant to this sub-category. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): ANN search is commonly used in multimedia applications such as video search and recommendation systems. The paper's focus on developing an online PQ model for dynamic databases is likely to be relevant to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
