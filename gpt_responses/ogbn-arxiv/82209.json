The paper also discusses the concept of secrecy potential, which is a common topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed Interactive Channel Coding (ICC) technique is a form of coding, which falls under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of i.i.d. variables, which is a common concept in machine learning (cs.MM) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
