The use of a deep encoder-decoder architecture and a novel loss function also suggests that it may fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as it addresses the issue of false positives in obstacle detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
