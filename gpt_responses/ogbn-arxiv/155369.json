Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for faceted search, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of deep learning models such as Bidirectional LSTMs and Bidirectional LSTM-CRF suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
