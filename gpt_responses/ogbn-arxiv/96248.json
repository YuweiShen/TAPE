Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, as it aims to find specific words in documents, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The paper also uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which are covered in cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper introduces an end-to-end trainable model based on deep neural networks, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
