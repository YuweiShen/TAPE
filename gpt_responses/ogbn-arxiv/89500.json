Specifically, it focuses on diminishing-returns (DR) submodular optimization, which has many real-world applications in machine learning, economics, and communication systems. The paper presents approximation and regret guarantees for maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular functions over down-closed and general convex sets in both offline and online settings. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
