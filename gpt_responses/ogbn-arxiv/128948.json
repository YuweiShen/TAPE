This involves learning coarse skill dynamics and unrolling them forward during lookahead search. The paper also mentions the use of existing multigoal RL formulations, analogous to options or macroactions. These aspects suggest that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Among these, cs.LG and cs.RO seem to be the most likely categories, as the paper focuses on learning policies for manipulation tasks using RL and involves skill-based exploration in a continuous control setting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
