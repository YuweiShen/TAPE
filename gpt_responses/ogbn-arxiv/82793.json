The proposed method is based on spectral clustering, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a dataset of volumetric images, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
