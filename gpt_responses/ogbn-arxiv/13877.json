Additionally, the paper mentions borrowing wisdom from human gaze following, which suggests a human-computer interaction (HCI) aspect. Therefore, cs.CV and cs.HC are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions multi-scale gaze direction fields and leveraging gaze direction to facilitate training, which involves machine learning (ML) techniques such as feature extraction and supervision. Therefore, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.MM are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
