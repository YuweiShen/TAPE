The use of cross-graph charging schemes is a technique that has been recently applied to obtain results for triangulations and other types of graphs, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also derives bounds on expected vertex-degrees in graphs, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The study of planarity and crossing properties of graphs is also relevant to graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of exponential growth rates of certain types of graphs, which is a topic in complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
