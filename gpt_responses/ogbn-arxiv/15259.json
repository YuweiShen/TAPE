This involves training a classification DNN to judge transfer feasibility and a regression DNN to estimate optimal fuel consumption. This use of DNNs falls under the category of artificial intelligence.\n2. cs.SY: The paper deals with the design of low-thrust-based multitarget interplanetary missions, which involves complex systems and control engineering. The use of DNNs for evaluating low-thrust transfers can be seen as a system identification and control problem, falling under the category of systems and control.\n3. cs.LG: The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for evaluating low-thrust transfers, which involves training DNNs on a dataset of infeasible and optimal transfers. This falls under the category of machine learning.\n4. cs.NE: The paper proposes a method based on DNNs, which are a type of artificial neural network. This falls under the category of neural networks.\n5. cs.SD: The paper deals with the design of low-thrust-based multitarget interplanetary missions, which involves software development for simulation and analysis.
