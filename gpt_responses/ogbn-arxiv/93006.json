This is a key area of research in information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the challenges and potential solutions for implementing the proposed scheme, including multi-beam selection, cooperative beam tracking, multi-beam power allocation, and synchronization. These are all important issues in networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions that mmWave communication enables gigabit multimedia applications, which suggests a potential connection to the multimedia sub-category. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of massive antenna arrays and directional beamforming, which are key components of control systems. \n\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): While this sub-category is less likely, the paper does touch on the societal implications of mmWave communication, such as the potential for improved connectivity and faster data transfer rates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
