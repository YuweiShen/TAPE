The system is designed for massive machine type communication (MTC) scenario, which involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also proposes a Multiple Measurement Model (MMV) model based massive MIMO, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
