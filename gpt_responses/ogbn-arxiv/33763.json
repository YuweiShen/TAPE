The paper specifically focuses on the challenges of tiling and stitching segmentation output for remote sensing imagery, which is a sub-problem within the broader field of CV/ML. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also proposes a novel approach to address the limitations of the conventional stitching approach, which involves increasing the input size of the CNN only during label inference. This approach is related to the field of ML, specifically deep learning (DL), and could potentially fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nAdditionally, the paper deals with large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets, which could be related to the sub-category of cs.GR (Graphics). Finally, the paper proposes a practical solution to a real-world problem, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
