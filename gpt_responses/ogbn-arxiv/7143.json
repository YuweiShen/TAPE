The method uses multi-objective particle swarm optimization, which is a technique commonly used in the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also discusses the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational cost, which is a topic often studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new encoding strategy and infrastructure design, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
