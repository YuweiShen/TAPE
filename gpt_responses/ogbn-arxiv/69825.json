This problem is related to databases (cs.DB) as the public query interfaces of these services can be modeled as a kNN interface over a database of two-dimensional points. The paper also discusses techniques for computing or estimating Voronoi cells, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The experiments conducted in the paper involve testing the algorithms on real-world data, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves developing algorithms for processing and analyzing data, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
