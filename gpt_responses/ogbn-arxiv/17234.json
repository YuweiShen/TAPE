The paper also proposes a quantum protocol for this problem, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the size of certificates required for classical certification mechanisms, which is related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
