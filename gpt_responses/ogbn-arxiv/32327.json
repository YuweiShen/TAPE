The paper also introduces a computationally simple model for controlling for topical fluctuations in corpora, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The use of the model to correct for topical fluctuations in historical time series could also be relevant to the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the emergence of new words and their relationship with trending topics, which could be relevant to the Sound (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
