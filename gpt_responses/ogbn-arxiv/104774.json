The proposed method uses RGB-D images to capture object motion, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also presents a probabilistic language model to associate lingual verbs with kinematic structures, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
