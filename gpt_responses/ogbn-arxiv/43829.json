This falls under the domain of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a deep neural network approach to map images into measurable features, which involves machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper discusses the use of these embeddings for robot control and planning, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
