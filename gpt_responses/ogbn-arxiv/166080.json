Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the interpretability of the deep features learned from pathological patches, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of clinical rules and domain knowledge of pathology, which suggests the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
