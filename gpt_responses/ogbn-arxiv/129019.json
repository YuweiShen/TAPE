The paper focuses on improving the efficiency and accuracy of feature selection, which is a common problem in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
