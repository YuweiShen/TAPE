Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). The paper also involves algorithms and computational complexity, which suggests the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also discusses the lexicographic ordering and information leakage, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
