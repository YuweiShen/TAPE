This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper focuses on medical imaging (cs.MED) and proposes novel architectures for improving segmentation accuracy (cs.AI). The use of pre-trained encoders also suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
