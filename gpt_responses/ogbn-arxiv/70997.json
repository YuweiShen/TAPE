It also involves the disentanglement of object-part pattern components from each filter, which is a common problem in computer vision. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for part localization, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a method to learn the explanatory graph without the need for annotating object parts. This is a common problem in machine learning, where the availability of labeled data is limited. \n\nThe paper also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a method to reveal the knowledge hierarchy hidden inside conv-layers of a pre-trained CNN. This is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence, where the interpretability of deep learning models is a crucial issue. \n\nThe paper also involves computational linguistics (cs.CL) as it proposes a graphical model, namely an explanatory graph, to organize the mined part patterns. This is a common problem in computational linguistics, where graphical models are used to represent the relationships between linguistic units. \n\nFinally, the paper involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it proposes a method for part localization, which is a fundamental task in multimedia analysis. This task involves the identification of objects and their parts in multimedia data, such as images"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
