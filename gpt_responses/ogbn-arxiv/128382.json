This falls under the purview of AI. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses state-of-the-art approaches for handling inconsistent data, which involve learning conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) from a clean sample of the data. This is a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with cleaning web data, which is a common task in information retrieval. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a framework for cleaning data, which involves learning generative and error models of the data.
