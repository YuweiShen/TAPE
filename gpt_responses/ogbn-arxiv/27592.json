The paper focuses on the decomposition of a single face image into biophysical parameters maps, diffuse and specular shading maps, and the estimation of the spectral power distribution of the scene illuminant and the spectral sensitivity of the camera. This task falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also deals with statistical priors, physical constraints, and sparsity priors, which are common in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The use of deep learning techniques and the imposition of model-based priors also suggest that this paper could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
