This involves training a CNN model to predict the difference in inverse-depth from varying viewpoints of two meshes. This work is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR), as it involves 3D reconstruction and mesh corrections. The use of machine learning techniques to learn priors over surfaces and appearance also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the problem of excessive smoothing and geometrical inconsistencies in corrected meshes suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO), as these issues can affect the performance of robots that rely on 3D maps for navigation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
