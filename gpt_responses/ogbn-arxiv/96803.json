It also discusses connectivity and cooperation, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and social networks (cs.SI). The use of entropy functions suggests a connection to coding theory and compression (cs.CE), while the consideration of degrees of freedom may relate to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
