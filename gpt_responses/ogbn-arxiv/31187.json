The paper also derives asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion, which is a common approach in information theory. \n2. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) - The paper considers a distributed version of the diversity scheme where sensors decide whether to transmit based only on their local channel information. This is a common problem in multi-agent systems where agents have limited communication and computational capabilities. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of decentralized estimation, which is a common problem in systems and control. The paper also studies the optimal power allocation for minimizing the expected distortion subject to average total power constraints, which is a common problem in control theory. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of transmitting measurements over a fading channel to a fusion center, which is a common problem in networking and internet architecture. The paper also studies the effect of optimizing the probability of transmission on the expected distortion in the distributed scenario, which is a common problem in networking. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of estimating a Gaussian source using multiple sensors, which is a common problem in multimedia applications such as audio"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
