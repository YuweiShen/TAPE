Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of rules and testing on complex narrative texts, which suggests a focus on machine learning and natural language understanding, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses the construction of object representations and the differences between approaches, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
