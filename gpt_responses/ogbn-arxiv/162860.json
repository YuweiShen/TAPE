The paper also mentions applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM), indicating that these sub-categories may also be relevant. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of universal denoising, which is a technique that can be applied across various domains and may be of interest to researchers in the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
