This makes it likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category deals with the use of logic in computer science, including formal methods, automated reasoning, and proof theory. The use of (co)induction and theorem proving in Hybrid makes it relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages. The use of higher-order abstract syntax in Hybrid makes it relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. The use of Hybrid as a tool for reasoning about object logics makes it relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data. While this paper does not directly deal with machine learning, the use of (co)induction and theorem proving in Hybrid may be relevant to certain areas of machine learning.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics, including natural language processing and computational"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
