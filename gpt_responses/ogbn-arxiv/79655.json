This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture sub-category. \n\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper focuses on improving the performance of video-conferencing applications, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia sub-category. \n\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper introduces a novel on-the-fly erasure coding concept, which suggests that it may belong to the Information Theory sub-category. \n\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a transmission scheme that relies on erasure coding, which is a common technique used in distributed computing. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing sub-category. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper may also belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category, as erasure coding is often used in secure communication protocols to ensure data integrity and confidentiality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
