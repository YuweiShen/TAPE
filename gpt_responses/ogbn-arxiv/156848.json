This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses distributed training with the parameter server architecture using multiple servers. This falls under the domain of distributed computing.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions that CNN models are often used for image classification, which is a subfield of computer vision.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, which falls under the domain of neural computing.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a scheme for automatic resource-aware layer placement within the TensorFlow framework, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
