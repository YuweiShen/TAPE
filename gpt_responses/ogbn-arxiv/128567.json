The use of sparsity-promoting penalties is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.NA), which suggests that these sub-categories are also likely. Finally, the paper includes a numerical example involving a partial differential equation, which is a common topic in computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
