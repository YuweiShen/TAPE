The use of convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) and normalization methods suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with multimedia processing (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
