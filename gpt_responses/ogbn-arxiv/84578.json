Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new approach called Symbiotic Augmentation (SA), which involves learning one mask per activation channel to reduce memory utilization. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed methods on facial and whole body attributes, indicating that it may be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
