The paper also discusses the effects of adaptive scaling on activation functions, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of ABUs in natural language processing tasks, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
