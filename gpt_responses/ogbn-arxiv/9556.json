Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses deep neural networks for implementation, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel soft intra-modal structure loss, which involves natural language processing techniques and can be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
