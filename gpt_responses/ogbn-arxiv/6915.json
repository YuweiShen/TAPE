This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of bidirectional LSTMs to capture spatial features and temporal dependencies suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the scalability of the model for both freeway and complex urban traffic networks, indicating that network engineering (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SI) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
