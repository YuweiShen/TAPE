This problem is related to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT) as it involves computing over implicit matrices. The paper also provides new techniques for identifying independence between two vectors in the streaming model, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
