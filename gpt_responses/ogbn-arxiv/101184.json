This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image classification, and security and privacy (CR) concerns related to adversarial attacks. The paper also discusses the use of differential evolution, a machine learning (ML) optimization technique, to select light patterns for the attack, which falls under the umbrella of ML (LG) and AI (AI). Finally, the paper involves experiments with 2D and 3D objects, which could fall under multimedia (MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
