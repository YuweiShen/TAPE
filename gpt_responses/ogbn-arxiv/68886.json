This involves the use of confidence prediction networks and training on automatically generated ground truth. The paper also presents a new 3D reconstruction pipeline that utilizes deep learning. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), graphics (cs.GR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
