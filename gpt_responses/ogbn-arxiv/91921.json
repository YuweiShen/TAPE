The proposed method involves the use of a weighted Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a popular deep learning architecture for sequential data analysis and falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
