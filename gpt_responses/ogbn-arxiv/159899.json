The paper discusses the use of a Quality Assurance Network (QANet) to estimate the Intersection over Union measure (IoU) with respect to the unknown ground truth. The paper also discusses the use of the RibCage Network architecture, which was originally proposed as a discriminator in an adversarial network framework. Given the focus on image segmentation and deep learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
