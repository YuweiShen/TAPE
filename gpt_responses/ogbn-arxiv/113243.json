The paper proposes a method to privatise the propensity score used in such studies and tests the method on both simulated and real-world datasets. The paper is likely to be categorised under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as it deals with privacy-preserving techniques, cs.LG (Machine Learning) as propensity score methods are commonly used in machine learning, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as causal inference is a subfield of AI, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper deals with data analysis, and cs.IT (Information Theory) as the paper discusses the effect of added noise on the propensity score."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
