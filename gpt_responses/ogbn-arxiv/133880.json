The paper also proposes a distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.MA). The paper discusses the stability of the sensing matrix, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
