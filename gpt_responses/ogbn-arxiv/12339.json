The paper also mentions graph algorithms such as maximal independent set and matching, which are topics that fall under the category of computational complexity and cryptography (cs.CC) and probability (cs.PR). However, since the focus of the paper is on parallelization and scheduling, we believe that cs.PF (performance) is less likely to be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
