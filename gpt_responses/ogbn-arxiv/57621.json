This involves incorporating 3D volumetric information and investigating different loss functions for training denoising models. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) are also possible categories due to the use of deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
