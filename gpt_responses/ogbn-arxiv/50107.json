This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of complex orthogonal designs, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and communications engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper mentions simulation results, which suggests the use of multimedia (cs.MM) techniques for evaluating the performance of the proposed codes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
