The use of swing speed up and footstep adjustment techniques involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The concept of center of pressure-based ankle strategy for balance and momentum rate of change calculation involves control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of simulation and experimental results, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for data analysis and interpretation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
