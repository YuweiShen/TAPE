This involves the unification of real and artificial spaces, such as databases and information webs, with natural spacetime. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Information Theory (cs.IT), Databases (cs.DB), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
