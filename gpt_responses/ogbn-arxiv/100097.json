The paper also mentions the use of computer vision-based approaches for positioning error correction, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). However, the main focus of the paper is on improving the performance of wheeled planetary rover dead-reckoning localization, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for navigation, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of periodic stops for updates, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
