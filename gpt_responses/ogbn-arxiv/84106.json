The paper also mentions the use of constraints and cost models, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research. Additionally, the focus on improving user experience suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC) research. Finally, the use of hybrid approaches and materialization may involve deep learning (cs.DL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
