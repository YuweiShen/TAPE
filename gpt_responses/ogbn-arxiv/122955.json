The use of neural networks for this task also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The task of estimating 3D pose can also be related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach involves metrics related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
