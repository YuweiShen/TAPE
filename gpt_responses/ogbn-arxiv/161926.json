The use of hybrid beamforming and one-bit quantization also involves system-level design and control (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on mmWave communication systems, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) involves machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
