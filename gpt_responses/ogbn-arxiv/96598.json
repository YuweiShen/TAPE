This involves adapting prediction timing based on uncertainty accumulation in Bayesian recurrent models. The paper is focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques applied to electronic health records, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with clinical events and patient outcomes, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CE (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics) sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of adapting granularity to inherent temporal resolutions, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model patient outcomes, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
