The techniques used in the paper involve optimization and linear algebra, which are common in the subfields of machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of the optimization landscape, which is related to the subfield of optimization, making cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the analysis of the recovery guarantees, which is related to the subfield of statistics, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
