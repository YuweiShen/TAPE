The use of morphological analyzers and interlinear glosses also suggests a focus on linguistic analysis and processing. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves the use of NMT and training on a dataset. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with the development of a translation system using AI techniques. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possibility as the paper involves the use of NMT, which is a neural network-based approach. \n\nFinally, cs.CY (Computers and Society) is a less likely sub-category, but it could be argued that the paper has implications for the use of technology in promoting multilingualism and language preservation in low-resource settings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
