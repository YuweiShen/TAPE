This falls under the category of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and program verification (cs.SE). The paper also uses symbolic execution to obtain Presburger arithmetic constraints, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of SAT/SMT solvers for solving the satisfiability problem, which falls under the category of symbolic computation (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
