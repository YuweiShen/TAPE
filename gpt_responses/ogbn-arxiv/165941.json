The paper introduces a new algorithm called ADFQ that updates beliefs on state-action values through an online Bayesian inference method known as Assumed Density Filtering. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper is about a new algorithm for reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Reinforcement learning is a subfield of AI, and this paper is about a new algorithm for reinforcement learning. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): Reinforcement learning is a popular method for training robots, and this paper could be of interest to researchers in robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): Reinforcement learning is a method for controlling systems, and this paper could be of interest to researchers in systems and control. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper extends ADFQ with a neural network, so it could be of interest to researchers in neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
