It may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it deals with searching for relevant images. The use of LSH projections suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the mention of datasets and computation times suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the mention of graph size and computation times suggests that it may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
