The proposed method involves active learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for reducing annotation cost. The paper also discusses data augmentation, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) fields. Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
