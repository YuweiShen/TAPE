The paper discusses the Low Rank Parity Check (LRPC) codes and proposes a new mixed algorithm for decoding erasures and errors. The paper also studies the semantic security of the signature algorithm and provides examples of parameters for the scheme. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
