This falls under the category of logic in computer science, which includes sub-categories such as logic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), mathematical logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), and machine learning (cs.LG). Given the focus on logic and automata theory, cs.LO and cs.FL are the most likely sub-categories. However, since the paper also discusses the use of MONA for symbolic DFA construction, which is a tool commonly used in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cs.AI and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. Finally, since the paper proposes a new encoding for LTLf formulas, cs.PL, which deals with programming languages and compilers, is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
