The paper proposes a distributed optimization method using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is a popular technique in control and optimization of networked systems (cs.SY). The paper also presents simulation results to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, which involves multimedia systems (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
