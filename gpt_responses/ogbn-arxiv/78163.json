This falls under the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The models proposed in the paper are non-linear and neural attentive, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV) or natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential use of attention weights in designing personalized degree plans, which could also fall under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with educational data mining, which could also place it under the sub-category of computational education (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
