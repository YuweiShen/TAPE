The paper also proposes a novel network architecture that incorporates multi-task learning and self-constrained learning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on three popular datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of recognizing facial expressions, which is a topic of interest in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
