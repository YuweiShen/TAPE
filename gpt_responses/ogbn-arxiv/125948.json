The constructions involve cyclic codes, which are a type of algebraic codes and can be analyzed using tools from algebraic geometry and number theory, making cs.DS a likely sub-category as well. The paper also involves optimization of the codes, which can be seen as a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The constructions may have practical applications in distributed storage systems, which falls under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
