This involves the use of convolutional networks and stacked autoencoders to detect the LV chamber and infer its shape, respectively. The inferred shape is then incorporated into deformable models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the segmentation. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other possible sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
