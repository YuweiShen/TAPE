This involves devising a statistical dynamical model of the system and proposing general optimization strategies for selecting high support formulae. The methodology is illustrated and applied on an in-depth case study of characterizing cardiac malfunction from electro-cardiogram data. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach to learn the formulae characterizing the emergent behavior of a dynamical system from system observations, which involves devising a statistical dynamical model of the system and proposing general optimization strategies for selecting high support formulae. This is a machine learning problem, and hence the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a methodology for learning temporal logical properties discriminating ECG models of cardiac arrhythmias. This involves devising a statistical dynamical model of the system and proposing general optimization strategies for selecting high support formulae. This is an artificial intelligence problem, and hence the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly deal with social and information networks. However, the methodology proposed in the paper can be applied to various systems"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
