The paper specifically focuses on the use of back translation for low-resource machine translation between Chinese and Vietnamese. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of neural machine translation (NMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT) models, which are machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nAdditionally, the paper evaluates the effects of different sizes of synthetic data on the translation models, which involves optimization and experimentation. This could place the paper under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which cover optimization and experimentation in machine learning and information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
