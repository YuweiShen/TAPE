The use of attention mechanisms and recurrent neural networks also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the method to medical imaging and diagnosis may also suggest relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
