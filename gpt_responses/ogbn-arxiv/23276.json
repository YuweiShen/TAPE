Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of weakly supervised learning, which is a common technique in computer vision research. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning approaches, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The proposed model also has potential applications in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
