The proposed methods involve iterative updating of the detector and instance labeling, which can be considered as machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of context classification and spatial restriction, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments are conducted on image datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
