The approach involves using autoencoders and hierarchical attention pooling to extract features from 3D pose sequences. This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the psychological motivation behind the affective features underlying gaits, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of motion-captured data suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
