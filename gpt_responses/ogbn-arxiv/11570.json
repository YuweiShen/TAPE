The method presented also relies on 6 degree-of-freedom poses and a 3D-model, which are common in robotics (cs.RO). The use of texture-maps is related to computer graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of the LINEMOD detector, which is a machine learning algorithm, making cs.AI a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
