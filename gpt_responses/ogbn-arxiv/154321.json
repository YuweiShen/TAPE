The paper also introduces a novel regional aggregated selective match kernel (R-ASMK), which involves machine learning techniques and could potentially fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques for text-based retrieval, which could fall under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) category.
