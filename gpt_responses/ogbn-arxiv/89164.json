The paper proposes an algorithm to learn the connections between branches in the network, which is a problem of network architecture search (cs.LG). The paper also optimizes a single loss function defined with respect to the end task, which is a problem of neural network optimization (cs.NE). The paper uses deep learning techniques to improve the performance of multi-class image classification, which is a problem of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and machine translation, which is a problem of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
