The paper also uses techniques from combinatorics (cs.DM) and optimization (cs.DS) to derive upper bounds on the maximum size of a binary code. The paper's focus on the minimum distance and minimum codeword weight of the code suggests that it may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the use of semidefinite programming (SDP) to derive bounds on the code size suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
