The experiments also involve several AI models such as sparse Gaussian processes and latent Dirichlet allocation.\n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with Bayesian inference, which is a common topic in statistics. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of $KL$-divergence convergence rate.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper uses particle filtering, which is a common technique in control theory and signal processing, to approximate a function.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of $KL$-divergence convergence rate, which is a common topic in information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
