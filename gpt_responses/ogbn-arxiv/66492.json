This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the implementation of various communication system components, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of shell and python scripts, which could fall under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) or distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
