The paper also focuses on accommodating the operator's motion inputs and autonomously regulating actions to compensate task constraints, which involves human-robot interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the importance of understanding how users perceive good arbitration in object telemanipulation, which involves user studies and human perception (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with generating poses that are better suited for human perception of successful teleoperated object manipulation and feeling of being in control of the robot, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
