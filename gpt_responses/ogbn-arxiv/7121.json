The use of REST HTTP protocol and random linear network coding (RLNC) also suggests that the paper could be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of algorithms and data structures to improve performance, which could place it under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with ensuring reliable communication in highly dynamic scenarios, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
