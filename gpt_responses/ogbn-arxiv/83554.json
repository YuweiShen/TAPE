The use of random matrix theory in the paper suggests that it could also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The paper also discusses channel modeling, which could place it in the signal processing (cs.SI) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the theoretical basis behind the Kronecker mismatch, which could place it in the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
