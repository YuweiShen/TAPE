The use of surrogate losses is a popular approach in this area, and the paper focuses on a class of linear-fractional metrics. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses regret bounds, which are related to online learning and optimization, suggesting that cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) could also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
