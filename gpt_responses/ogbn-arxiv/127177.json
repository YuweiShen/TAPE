The paper uses tools from information theory, probability theory, and computational complexity theory. The focus is on the R\\'enyi entropy, which is a generalization of the Shannon entropy, and the paper provides new upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of estimating it. The paper also uses techniques from polynomial approximation theory to improve the sample complexity for noninteger values of the R\\'enyi parameter. Overall, the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in information theory, probability theory, computational complexity theory, and related areas, and could be classified under several arXiv CS sub-categories, such as cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
