It may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as it proposes a fault-tolerant SDN controller that coordinates different switches. Additionally, it may belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as it addresses the potential for incorrect behavior due to stale network states. It may also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it proposes a solution for maintaining a consistent network view using transactional semantics. Finally, it may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it proposes a solution that uses transactional semantics on both control and data plane state."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
