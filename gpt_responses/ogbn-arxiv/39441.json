Additionally, the paper proposes a novel system model for effective resource allocation and uses a semi-Markov decision process to capture the real-time arrival of slice requests. \n\nThe paper also uses deep learning techniques, specifically deep dueling neural networks, to optimize the resource allocation policy. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the optimization of multiple resources, such as radio, computing, and storage, which suggests that it may also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
