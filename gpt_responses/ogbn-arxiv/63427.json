The paper also discusses the trade-off between speed and accuracy, which is a common concern in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper explores different ways to optimize the performance of object detection systems, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the implementation of these systems on different hardware and software platforms, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
