This is a typical topic in programming languages research.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions that the denotational semantics is fully abstract, which is a property often studied in logic-based approaches to semantics.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper deals with concurrent programming, which is a key topic in software engineering. The equational theory for computational effects may also be relevant to software engineering.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention distributed or parallel computing, the topic of cooperative threads is often studied in the context of parallel programming. The equational theory for thread spawning may also be relevant to distributed computing.\n- cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper deals with threads, which are a fundamental concept in operating systems. The equational theory for thread spawning may also be relevant to operating systems research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
