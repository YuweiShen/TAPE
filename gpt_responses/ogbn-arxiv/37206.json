This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) and investigates the duplexing mode in which small cells (SCs) should operate during uplink macrocell transmissions. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the coordination across the tiers due to flexible and asymmetric TDD operation. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the potential throughput improvement that can be achieved by exploiting interference nulling and implicit coordination across the tiers. This falls under the scope of multimedia.\n- cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly discuss any social or ethical implications of the research, but it may indirectly impact the society by improving the performance of cellular networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
