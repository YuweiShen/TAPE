It may also belong to \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) as the authors have used different strategies to build a word level language tagger. Additionally, it may fall under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) as the paper discusses the use of low resources to achieve high accuracy. \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SD) are also possible categories as the paper may involve the use of neural networks and control systems to achieve the desired results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
