Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a new network architecture that improves the speed and accuracy of video object detection, which involves machine learning techniques. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely categories. The paper also deals with feature fusion and propagation, which are common topics in multimedia processing (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
