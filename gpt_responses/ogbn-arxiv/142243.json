Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of weak supervision signals and self-training, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which could place it under cs.IR. Finally, the paper uses a hierarchical neural structure, which is a common technique in deep learning and could place it under cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
