Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with NLP. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) to retrieve similar factchecks, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of NLP also suggests the involvement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which makes cs.AI a likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning (ML) which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves the use of technology to combat misinformation which falls under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
