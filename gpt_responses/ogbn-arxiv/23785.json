This involves developing a framework that is flexible enough to incorporate various causal inference and online bandit methods. The paper also derives theoretical bounds on the decision maker's regret compared to its optimal decision. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
