The use of eigen-beamforming (EBF) precoding and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoders suggests a focus on network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The consideration of moderately large antenna arrays and the characterization of achievable rates based on the angular spread (AS) may also fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and communication and networking (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
