This suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper applies the framework of maximizing sequence submodular functions to two problems in online advertising, which involves machine learning techniques such as online ad allocation and query rewriting. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning category.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): One of the applications of the framework presented in the paper is query rewriting, which is a problem in information retrieval. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Retrieval category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a framework for optimizing functions defined over sequences, which is a problem that is relevant to artificial intelligence. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Artificial Intelligence category.\n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper presents a greedy algorithm for maximizing sequence submodular functions, which is a problem that is related to game theory. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computer Science and Game Theory category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
