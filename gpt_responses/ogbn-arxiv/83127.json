The paper also discusses fault-tolerant solutions for compromised IMUs, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also mentions adversarial attacks, which could fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The proposed solution involves using separate position and heading information, which could involve Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) techniques for estimation and recovery."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
