The approach involves using abstraction, counterexample-guided refinement (CEGAR), and interpolation, which are techniques commonly used in programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses precision adjustment, which is a topic in formal languages (cs.FL) and graph theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
