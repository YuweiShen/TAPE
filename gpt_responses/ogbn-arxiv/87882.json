The use of spatially-coupled codes is a key aspect of the paper, which is a topic related to distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses an efficient interleaving scheme, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI). The use of spatially-coupled codes for error correction in channels with SNR variation is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed codes through simulation results, which is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
