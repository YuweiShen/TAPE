The method is based on the retinex theory and uses an illumination map for atmospheric light estimation, transmission map estimation, and low-light enhancement. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of CNNs also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves image processing and enhancement, which could place it in the graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
