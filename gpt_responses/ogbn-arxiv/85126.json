This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it involves data exfiltration. The paper also discusses modulation techniques, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The use of IP cameras and networks suggests a focus on networking and internet technologies (cs.NI). The implementation of a prototype of exfiltration malware suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential risks and implications of this method, which falls under the category of cybercrime (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
