This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): Barrier certificates are also used in robotics for safety verification of robot motion planning. The paper discusses how to synthesize more expressive barrier certificates efficiently using semi-definite programming, which is a common technique used in robotics.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses how to relax the condition of barrier certificates while still keeping their convexity, which involves logical reasoning and manipulation of constraints.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses how to discover certificates from the general relaxed condition by SDP, which involves programming and algorithmic techniques.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with safety verification of hybrid systems, which is a common problem in the field of AI for autonomous systems. The use of barrier certificates and their synthesis using SDP also involves techniques commonly used in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
