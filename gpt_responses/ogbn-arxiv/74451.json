This falls under the realm of information theory (cs.IT) and error-correcting codes (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the properties of the Xing-Ling codes and their subcodes, which could potentially be of interest to researchers in cryptography (cs.CR) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the size of the constructed quantum codes, which could be relevant to researchers in storage systems (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
