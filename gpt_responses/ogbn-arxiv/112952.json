The paper proposes a novel encryption technique for sequential circuits, which involves inserting multiplexers (MUX) to encrypt the outputs of selected flip-flops. This technique involves designing and implementing hardware, which falls under the category of computer engineering (cs.AR) and digital circuits (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed technique in thwarting different attacks, which involves analyzing and evaluating the performance of the encryption technique, falling under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
