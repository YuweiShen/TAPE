The focus is on symmetric clique potentials, which are commonly used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks (cs.CL, cs.CV). The paper also presents algorithms for computing outgoing messages from clique clusters, which involves optimization and approximation techniques (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
