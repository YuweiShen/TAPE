The focus on chunked codes and their performance analysis suggests a potential fit with the distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of regular graphs in the construction of the proposed codes may also indicate a connection with the theory of error-correcting codes (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
