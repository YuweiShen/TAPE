The proposed method involves using eigen-texturing and eigen-deformation to represent the texture and deformation of a partially observed non-rigid 3D human, which is a technique that could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural-network-based coefficient regression, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
