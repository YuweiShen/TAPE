This approach is applicable to various types of neural networks and can achieve significant reductions in FLOPs and network parameters with negligible accuracy cost overhead. Given the focus on neural networks and optimization techniques, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of matrix sketching and efficient optimization methods suggests possible sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
