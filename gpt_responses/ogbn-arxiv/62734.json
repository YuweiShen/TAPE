This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed regularisation model is a learning-based technique, which also falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with multi-modal data sets, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper demonstrates how the learnt deep models can be used for classification, which falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
