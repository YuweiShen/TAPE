This technique is applicable to a wide range of domains and allows for determining bounds on approximation error. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with decision-making and optimization problems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves learning the weights of the linear value function. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it proposes a new algorithmic technique for solving FOMDPs. \n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) as it can be applied to decision-making problems involving multiple agents. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) as it can be used for optimizing the behavior of robots in various scenarios."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
