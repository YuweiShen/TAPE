The paper discusses the dependence of the Gaussian input information rate on the line-of-sight (LOS) matrix in MIMO coherent Rician fading channels. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses communication systems, so cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) is also likely. The paper also deals with signal processing and channel modeling, which fall under cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), respectively. Finally, the paper provides extensions to multiple-access channels (MAC), which fall under cs.MA (Multiagent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
