This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed models are based on latent Gaussian or t processes with nonlinear covariance functions, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the development of a variational inference technique on tensors to efficiently learn the InfTucker from data. This involves the use of algorithms and data structures.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The experimental results include social network datasets, indicating the relevance of the paper to the study of social and information networks.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the analysis of multiway data, which involves the study of information theory and its applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
