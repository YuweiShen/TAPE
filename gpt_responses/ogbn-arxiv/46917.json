This falls under the domain of game theory. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of revealing information to bidders in order to maximize revenue in ad auctions. This involves techniques related to information retrieval and recommendation systems. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms for designing optimal signaling schemes in ad auctions, which involves developing efficient data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a Bayesian valuation setting to model the behavior of bidders and the auctioneer, which involves techniques related to machine learning and probabilistic modeling. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper explores the power of private signaling schemes in ad auctions, which involves analyzing the security and privacy implications of such schemes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
