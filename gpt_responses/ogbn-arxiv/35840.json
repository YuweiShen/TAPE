The concept of non-overlapping codes is related to combinatorics (cs.DM) and the study of sets and their properties. The paper also discusses bounds on the cardinality of codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper mentions applications in synchronization (cs.SI), which is a subfield of computer science concerned with coordinating the actions of multiple devices or processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
