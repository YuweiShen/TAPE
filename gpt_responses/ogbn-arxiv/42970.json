The use of deep neural networks for object classification suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The tracking aspect of the algorithm may also fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of multiple fisheye images suggests a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
