The problem is known to be NP-hard in general graphs, but there are some special cases where polynomial-time algorithms are known. The paper focuses on the case where all terminals are on a common face, which is a natural and important special case. The paper uses techniques from graph theory, combinatorics, and computational geometry, which are typical of the subfields of cs.DS, cs.CG, cs.GT, cs.DM, and cs.CC. Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper. Among them, cs.DS and cs.CG are the most likely, as they are directly related to the problem of finding vertex-disjoint paths in planar graphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
