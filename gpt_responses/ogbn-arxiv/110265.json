The proposed method, Geometric SMOTE, involves generating synthetic data points, which is a technique used in computer vision (cs.CV) and data mining (cs.DM) to address imbalanced datasets. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
