The method is also applicable to computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) where density estimation is a common task. The paper mentions the use of stochastic optimization, which is a common technique in neural networks and falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
