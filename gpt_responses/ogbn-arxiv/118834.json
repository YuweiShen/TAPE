The numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed approach involves learning the local data structure and projecting the state onto the associated local convex manifold reconstructed based on the nearest experimental data. The paper also introduces a penalty relaxation to recast the local learning solver in the context of non-negative least squares that can be solved effectively. \n\n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed approach is aimed at enhancing scientific computing and is particularly useful for real-world engineering applications. \n\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper employs the reproducing kernel approximation with stabilized nodal integration for the solution of the physical manifold, which is a common technique used in computer vision and pattern recognition. \n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is less likely, but the paper does mention the use of the proposed approach for high-dimensional data sets that are relatively sparse, which could be relevant to social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
