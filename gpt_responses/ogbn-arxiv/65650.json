This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of synthetic artefact creation in k-space and curriculum learning approaches also suggest the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of deep learning architectures for classification tasks is a common theme in neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
