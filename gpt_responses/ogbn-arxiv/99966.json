The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles, suggest that the paper may also belong to the robotics sub-category, cs.RO. The proposed method involves using inertial measurements, which could fall under the machine learning sub-category, cs.LG, or the artificial intelligence sub-category, cs.AI. Finally, the paper deals with robustness to outliers, which is a common problem in control systems, suggesting that it may also belong to the systems and control sub-category, cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
