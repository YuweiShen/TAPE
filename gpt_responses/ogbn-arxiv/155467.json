The use of deep learning models and optimization techniques also suggests the machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of cross-domain retrieval, which involves dealing with large variations in image characteristics, indicating the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
