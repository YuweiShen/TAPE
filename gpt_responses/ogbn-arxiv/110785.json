The paper also focuses on the robustness of the knowledge graph embedding to adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper deals with manipulating the plausibility of targeted facts in a knowledge graph, which is related to database management (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
