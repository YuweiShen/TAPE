The paper proposes a new algorithm called Isplit Lbi, which is based on variable splitting and regularization, and is designed to generate individualized partial rankings that take into account personal diversity and abnormal user behavior. The paper also presents extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as these are the most relevant areas for the problem of partial ranking prediction. The sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are also possible, as they are related to the data and network aspects of the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
