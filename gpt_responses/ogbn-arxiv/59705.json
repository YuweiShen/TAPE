The system uses code reachability and dynamic analysis to extract features, which are then used to train a supervised machine learning model (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the implementation of the system using Python and LLVM (cs.PL), and its applicability to various kinds of programs (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
