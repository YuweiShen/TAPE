This involves a new local point cloud representation and a mixture-of-experts architecture for normal estimation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by graphics (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also heavily relies on neural networks (cs.NEURAL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques, which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
