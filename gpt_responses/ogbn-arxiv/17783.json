The paper discusses a new approach for translating natural language questions to SPARQL queries, which is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) research. The paper also focuses on querying knowledge bases (KBs) over the Semantic Web, which is related to database (DB) research. Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of the approach to make it accessible to the research community and end-users, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Finally, the paper evaluates the approach using different languages, which is related to computational linguistics (CL) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.DB, cs.CL, cs.IR, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
