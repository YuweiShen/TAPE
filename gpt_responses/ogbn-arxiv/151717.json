The paper also analyzes the behavior of these networks and their connection to the problem of adversaries, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the existence of universal adversarial perturbations, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes implications for constructing neural nets that are both accurate and robust to adversarial attack, which is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
