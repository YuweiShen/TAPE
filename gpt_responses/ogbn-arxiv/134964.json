The paper also proposes algorithms for solving related problems, which suggests that it could be relevant to computer science theory (cs.THEORY) and data structures (cs.DS). The use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and their bijection with row-Fishburn matrices could also make the paper relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
