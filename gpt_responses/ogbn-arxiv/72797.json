This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also discusses hardware implementation on FPGAs, which falls under embedded systems (cs.ET) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a weight quantization framework using optimization techniques, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.AR, cs.ET, cs.SY, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
