The paper also discusses regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper explores the capacity of deep neural networks, which is a topic often studied in the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses object recognition, which is a task commonly studied in the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
