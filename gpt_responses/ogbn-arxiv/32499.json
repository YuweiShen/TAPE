The proposed method involves reducing the sorting complexity, which can be seen as a problem in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the implementation complexity, which is a concern in systems and control (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method, which can be seen as a topic in computer architecture (cs.AR) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
