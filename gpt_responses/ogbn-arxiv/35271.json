The use of \"black box\" access to samples from the distribution suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) for efficient computation. The paper also discusses the representation complexity of revenue-maximizing auctions, which could be related to machine learning (cs.AI) and computational learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
