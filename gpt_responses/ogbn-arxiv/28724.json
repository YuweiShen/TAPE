This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper specifically focuses on deep learning models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses experiments on text classification, so cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a possibility. Finally, the paper uses dynamic programming and caching, which are common techniques in optimization and algorithms, so cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
