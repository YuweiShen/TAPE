The methodology is based on Gaussian Processes and the optimization of an acquisition function. This work involves machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Gaussian Processes, and optimization, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with the construction of surrogate models for complex systems, which is a common problem in the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
