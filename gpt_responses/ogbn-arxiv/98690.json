The technique is based on contraction theory and sum-of-squares programming, which are optimization and control theory concepts that are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the generalization of the method to new environments and real-time adaptation to dynamic obstacles, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
