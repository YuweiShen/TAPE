The method is data-driven and uses a new class of parameters called Synaptic Strength, which is related to neural science (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on image classification tasks, which is a common application in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
