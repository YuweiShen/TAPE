The stochastic knapsack problem is a classic problem in operations research and has been studied extensively in the computer science literature. The paper proposes new approximation algorithms for this problem, as well as for related problems in budgeted learning and bandit problems. These topics are relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), game theory (cs.GT), information theory (cs.IT), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
