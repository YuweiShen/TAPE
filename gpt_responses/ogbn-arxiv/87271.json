The paper also discusses the impact of data composition on the resulting embeddings, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes optimization approaches to balance influences and quality of word embeddings, which can be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and social media analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
