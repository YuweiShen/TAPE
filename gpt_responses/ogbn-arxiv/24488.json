Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel fair summarization algorithm, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the evaluation of summarization algorithms, which involves information retrieval techniques, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category. The paper also proposes a fairness metric to evaluate summarization algorithms, which involves statistical analysis, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of summarization algorithms on different socially salient groups, which involves social network analysis, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
