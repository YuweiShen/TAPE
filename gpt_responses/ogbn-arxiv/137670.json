The use of subspace analysis on a Grassmann manifold is a key component of the proposed method, which suggests a strong connection to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and data analysis (cs.DS). The application of the method to clustering problems also suggests a connection to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of multiple modalities and relationships between entities in the graphs suggests a connection to social network analysis (cs.SI) and graph theory (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
