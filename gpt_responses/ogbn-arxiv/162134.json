The paper proposes a new regularisation approach to improve the representations learned by these predictors, which is a machine learning technique and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with knowledge graphs, which are a type of database, and thus falls under the category of databases (cs.DB). The paper discusses the use of embeddings, which is a natural language processing technique, and thus falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses link prediction tasks, which is a type of information retrieval task, and thus falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
