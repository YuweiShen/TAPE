This topic falls under the category of Computer Networks and Communications (cs.NI). The paper also addresses the challenges and evaluation parameters of the coexistence architectures, which could be classified under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Architecture (cs.AR). Additionally, the deployment scenarios and technology used could be relevant to Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
