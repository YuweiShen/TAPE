The use of deep learning models for image sampling and estimation also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on motion estimation and use of geometric constraints could also suggest that it belongs to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of the KITTI dataset and experimental analysis suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
