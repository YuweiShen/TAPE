This methodology involves generalizing the information plane to any cost function and using layer-wise information quantities to understand the dynamics of learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
