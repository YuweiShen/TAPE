It also uses high-capacity deep networks and a critic model to learn within a compact latent space. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category as it deals with learning policies for complex control tasks directly from high-dimensional image inputs. \n\nThe cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category is also likely as the paper deals with learning from image observations. \n\nThe cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category is another possibility as the paper deals with learning policies for control tasks. \n\nFinally, the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with learning policies for control tasks and uses a critic model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
