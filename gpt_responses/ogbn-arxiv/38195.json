Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), so cs.CL and cs.CV are also likely sub-categories. The paper proposes methods to reduce the amount of training data required, which involves machine learning techniques such as crowdsourcing and identifying harmful examples, so cs.LG and cs.AI are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
