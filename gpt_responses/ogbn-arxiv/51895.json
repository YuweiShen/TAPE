The paper uses techniques from linear algebra, optimization, and probability theory, which are typical of the subfield of machine learning known as \"large-scale optimization\" or \"big data analytics\". Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the main category for papers on machine learning. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of data structures and algorithms for processing large datasets, which is typical of the subfield of \"data structures and algorithms\" (cs.DS). Moreover, the paper uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) to analyze the performance of the algorithms. \n\nThe paper also involves numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA), which are important subfields of computer science that deal with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving mathematical problems. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of multiple response least-squares regression, which is a problem in statistics that involves the analysis of multivariate data. Therefore, the subfield of \"statistics\" (cs.SI) is also relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
