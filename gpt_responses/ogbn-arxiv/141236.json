The paper also presents a single-letter approximation that can be computed efficiently, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also mentions a numerical example, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper deals with achieving specific rates, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with coding over channels, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
