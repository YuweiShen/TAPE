This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions the use of disjunctive logic programs, which is a subfield of programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The development of a proof-of-concept implementation involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
