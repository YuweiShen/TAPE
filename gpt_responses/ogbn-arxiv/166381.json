The authors also mention practical applications such as robotics, which falls under the category of robotics and automation (cs.RO). The dataset and benchmark they propose involve extensive evaluation of recent and state-of-the-art trackers, which suggests a focus on machine learning and computer vision (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between bandwidth constraints and computational costs, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
