The paper also explores different approaches to address this problem, including the use of stochastic binary neurons, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the potential applications of these approaches in image processing (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
