Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a new approach to improve generalization in NLI models, which involves modifying the input representations. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to subcategories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which could be of interest to researchers in subcategories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
