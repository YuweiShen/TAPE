The proposed model uses an attention mechanism and LSTM network, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of large-scale datasets, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). The authors also discuss the use of existing fixation datasets, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of their work on human-computer interaction, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
