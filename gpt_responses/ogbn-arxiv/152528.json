The paper also discusses the use of software tools for this purpose, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The modification of the abstraction algorithm is a computational optimization, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The examples provided in the paper involve vehicular traffic networks, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with the abstraction of continuous-space control systems into finite models, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
