The focus is on promoting coordination between agents, which is a key challenge in multi-agent systems. The paper proposes policy regularization methods to achieve this goal. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The paper also deals with continuous control tasks, which suggests that it could be relevant to robotics and control systems, hence cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
