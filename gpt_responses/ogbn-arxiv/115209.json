The paper also discusses the use of probability in defining anonymity, which is a topic studied in Information Theory (cs.IT). The concept of admissible schedulers is related to the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), while the proof technique for anonymity is related to logic and verification (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
