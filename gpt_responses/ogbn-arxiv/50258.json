Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework, which falls under the category of control systems, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely category. The paper also proposes a novel convex inner approximation method, which involves optimization and mathematical programming, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) possible categories. Finally, the paper uses real-world experiments and mentions computer vision techniques for dynamic environment perception, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
