The paper uses martingale theory and focuses on worst-case dependence of regret on the choice of prior. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
