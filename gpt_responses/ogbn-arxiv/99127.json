Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions Grossberg's influence in engineering and dynamical systems, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Lastly, Grossberg's work has had an impact on various fields, which could be covered under cs.LG (Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
