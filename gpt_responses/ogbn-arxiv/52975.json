The proposed models are based on autoencoding, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of mutual information, which is a common measure in information theory and machine learning (cs.AI). The models are trained using optimization techniques, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed models in (semi-)supervised learning, which is a common problem in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
