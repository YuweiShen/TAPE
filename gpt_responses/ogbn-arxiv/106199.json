The study focuses on publications with digital object identifiers (DOIs), which are typically found in the computer science digital library (cs.DL) category. Additionally, the study involves analyzing the distribution and presence of readership scores over time, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI). The use of Mendeley as a tool for scientometric purposes also relates to cybernetics (cs.CY) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
