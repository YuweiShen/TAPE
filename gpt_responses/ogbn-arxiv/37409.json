The paper discusses the impact of active learning and semi-supervised training on the acoustic and language models, which are key components of speech recognition systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of active learning and semi-supervised training, which are machine learning techniques. The paper also evaluates the performance of different confidence models, which are used to select data for training the models. \n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper is about speech recognition, which involves processing sound signals. The paper discusses the impact of different data selection approaches on the acoustic model, which is responsible for converting sound signals into text. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to improve speech recognition performance. The paper also evaluates the performance of different data selection approaches, which are based on confidence models. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is less likely, but the paper could be relevant to this category if the speech recognition system is used in a social or information network context. For example, speech recognition could be used in a social media platform to transcribe user-generated content."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
