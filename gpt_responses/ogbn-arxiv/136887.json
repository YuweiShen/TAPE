The use of a constrained optimization problem and the emphasis on long-term autonomy and adaptability suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also presents a decentralized control algorithm, which falls under the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of a cost function and the emphasis on convergence suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
