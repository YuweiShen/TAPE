This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The concept of graph separation is also related to graph theory (cs.DM) and graph algorithms (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses experimental evaluation, which could fall under social and information networks (cs.SI) if the experiments involve network data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
