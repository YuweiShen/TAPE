The focus on sublinear memory and low-degree subgraphs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the area of sparse graph algorithms (cs.DM). The use of randomized algorithms and the need for derandomization suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the area of probabilistic algorithms (cs.CC).
