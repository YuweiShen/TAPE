The paper focuses on balancing two goals: faithful generative explanations of high-dimensional data and accurate prediction of associated class labels. The paper also introduces a new prediction-constrained objective that trains models to predict labels from heldout data while producing good generative likelihoods and interpretable topic-word parameters. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with clinical data, it could also belong to cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
