Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also introduces a new regularization technique, which falls under the category of machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the adaptation of regularization strength, which is a characteristic of optimization algorithms, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category. The paper also evaluates the proposed technique on downstream tasks, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) depending on the nature of the tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
