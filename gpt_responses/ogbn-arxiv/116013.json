The proposed design also takes into account the heterogeneity of path loss effects and dynamic number of cooperating base stations, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed design in terms of per-user throughput loss, which involves mathematical modeling and analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity feedback indices selection algorithm, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
