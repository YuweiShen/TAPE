It also discusses DART, a run-time system with an abstracted tier above existing one-sided communication libraries. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the implementation of PGAS (partitioned global address space) model in the form of C++ templates in DASH. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of C++ templates in DASH to implement PGAS model. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss machine learning, the use of self-adaptive behavior in DASH applications could potentially fall under this category. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses high-level features of DASH that enable more complex automatic transformations and optimizations in the future, which could fall under the category of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
