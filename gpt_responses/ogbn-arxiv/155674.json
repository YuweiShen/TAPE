This involves the transmission of packets from one source to many receivers over a single-hop broadcast erasure channel. The paper proposes a novel NACK-based feedback mechanism that enables all receivers to request, within a single time slot, the number of retransmissions needed for successful decoding. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with a feedback protocol for wireless broadcast networks that utilize linear network coding. This involves the transmission of packets from one source to many receivers over a single-hop broadcast erasure channel. Information theory deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel feedback protocol for wireless broadcast networks that utilize linear network coding. This involves the transmission of packets from one source to many receivers over a single-hop broadcast erasure channel. Networking and Internet Architecture deals with the design, implementation, and management of computer networks and communication systems. \n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a novel NACK-based feedback mechanism that enables all receivers to request, within a single time slot, the number of retransmissions needed for successful decoding. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
