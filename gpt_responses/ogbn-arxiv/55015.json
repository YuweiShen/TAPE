The use of random frames with sub-Gaussian rows is a common technique in compressed sensing (cs.LG), and the paper extends the analysis to this setting. The paper also uses numerical methods to observe decay rates, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
