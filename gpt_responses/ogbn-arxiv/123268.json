This involves evaluating instance aesthetics and set compatibility simultaneously, which suggests the use of computer vision (CV) and multimodal (MM) deep learning techniques. The proposed system also leverages outfit popularity on fashion-oriented websites, which could involve information retrieval (IR) techniques. The scoring component is a deep learning system, which suggests the use of machine learning (LG) techniques. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for collecting and processing the fashion outfit dataset. Overall, the most likely sub-categories are CV and MM, followed by IR, LG, and CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
