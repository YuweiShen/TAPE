Additionally, submodular functions are often used in optimization problems, suggesting that it could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on the theory of submodular functions could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
