This is a core topic in game theory and is likely to be classified under this sub-category. \n2. cs.CC (Computer Science - Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the computational complexity of various problems related to Nash equilibrium, including their inapproximability. This is a key area of research in computational complexity theory and is likely to be classified under this sub-category. \n3. cs.DS (Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents algorithms for finding approximate Nash equilibria and discusses their complexity. This is a core topic in algorithms and data structures and is likely to be classified under this sub-category. \n4. cs.AI (Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the complexity of finding approximate pure Bayes Nash equilibria in two-player games, which is a key topic in artificial intelligence. This is likely to be classified under this sub-category. \n5. cs.DM (Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics): The paper uses techniques from discrete mathematics, such as the hidden clique problem, to prove inapproximability results for various variants of Nash equilibrium.
