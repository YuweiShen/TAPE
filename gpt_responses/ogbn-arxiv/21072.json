The paper also mentions Arikan's polar codes, which are a type of error-correcting code and fall under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). The use of multiple local kernels and the analysis of the unpredictability of message bits suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on achieving near-optimal convergence to channel capacity suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG), which often deals with optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
