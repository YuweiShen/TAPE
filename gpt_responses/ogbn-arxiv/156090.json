The use of ensembles and specialized experts also suggests a machine learning approach, which could fall under networked systems (cs.NI) or machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on low-complexity decoding could also relate to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of hard-decision decoding is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
