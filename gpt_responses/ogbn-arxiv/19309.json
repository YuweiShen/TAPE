The paper uses tools from graph theory, such as the linkage theorem and graph minors, and provides explicit time bounds for TMC on specific graph classes, such as planar graphs and graphs of genus g. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
