It may also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) because the proposed algorithms involve decision-making and optimization. The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) because it deals with the efficient collection and use of contextual information. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of computational engineering (cs.CE) and information theory (cs.IT) because it addresses the issue of costly feature collection and proposes methods to minimize regret."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
