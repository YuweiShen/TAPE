This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT), as well as data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) which are relevant for designing efficient algorithms for group testing. The paper also discusses error probabilities and decision rules, which are topics in statistical inference (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
