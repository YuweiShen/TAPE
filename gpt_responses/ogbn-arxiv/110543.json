Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction, which falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also deals with multi-task learning, which is a common technique in Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Neural Networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) responses for user-centric affect recognition, which falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
