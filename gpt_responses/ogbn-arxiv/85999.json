The use of networks and links suggests a focus on networking (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC), but the paper specifically mentions parallel-link networks, which is more specific and may fall under the category of computer communications (cs.CC). Finally, the notion of hidability and its relationship to information-theoretic secrecy suggests a possible connection to security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
