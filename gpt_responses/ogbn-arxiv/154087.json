The paper focuses on using scalar-, vector-, and tensor fields over 3D Euclidean space to represent data, which suggests a focus on computer vision and image processing. The use of SE(3)-equivariant convolutions also suggests a focus on geometric deep learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nOther likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), as these sub-categories also cover topics related to deep learning, neural networks, and data representation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
