The use of DNNs for artificial intelligence (AI) applications suggests that cs.AI is a likely sub-category. The optimization of DNNs involves machine learning techniques, which suggests cs.LG as another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with computer vision (CV) applications, which suggests cs.CV as a possible sub-category. The use of embedded platforms and the need for efficient execution suggests cs.AR (embedded systems and robotics) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques and the need for efficient computation suggests cs.SY (systems and control) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
