This falls under the category of hardware architecture.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The proposed low-power CAM design can be used in embedded systems due to its low energy consumption and search delay. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the mechanism for associativity between the input tags and the corresponding address of the output data, which involves data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CE (Computer Engineering): The paper presents a design for a low-power CAM using a 0.13\u03bcm CMOS technology, which falls under the category of computer engineering.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed low-power CAM design can be used in systems and control applications where fast and efficient searching is required."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
