The proposed frameworks are built on a novel dual-branch architecture that has an image classification and a density branch. The experiments are performed on COCO, Visual Genome and PASCAL 2007 datasets. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes partially supervised settings and novel frameworks, which involve machine learning techniques. Hence, it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with object counting, which is related to security and surveillance, and could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
