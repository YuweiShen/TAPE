It also involves the use of convolutional neural networks, which is a common technique in computer vision. The paper also mentions the use of learnable spatio-temporal feature aggregation, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which could also place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also mentions the investigation of different strategies for pooling and combining signals, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of benchmarks for video classification, which could place it under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
