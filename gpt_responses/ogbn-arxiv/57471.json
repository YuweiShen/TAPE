Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.LG. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of planning, which is a topic in cs.PL. The paper's objective is to improve the practical applicability of planning in systems, which could be categorized under cs.RO or cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
