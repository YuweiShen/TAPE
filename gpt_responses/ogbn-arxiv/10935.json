The use of datasets commonly used in deep learning literature suggests that it may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a series of tunable kernels, which suggests it may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
