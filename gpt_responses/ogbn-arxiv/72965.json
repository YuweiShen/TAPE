It also applies the bounds to two types of sources, discrete binary symmetric source and continuous Gaussian source, which are commonly studied in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also uses convex optimization, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT).
