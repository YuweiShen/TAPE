The proposed framework also involves modeling the distribution of devices using a stochastic process (cs.SI) and deriving analytical expressions for statistical significance, outage probability, and average throughput (cs.IT). The paper also studies the impact of different system topologies on D2D system throughput (cs.SY) and proposes a strategy for identifying clusters of devices that can be leveraged for D2D communications (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
