The protocol also involves information theory (cs.IT) and cybersecurity (cs.CY) as it aims to provide secure communication between two parties. The use of certificateless cryptography and the absence of pairing suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of computational complexity (cs.CE) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
