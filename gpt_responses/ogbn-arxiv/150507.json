The paper also mentions the use of a Kronecker-type random matrix, which is a common tool in research on multi-input multi-output wireless communication systems, indicating a possible connection to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The statistical mechanics method used in the paper suggests a possible connection to the sub-categories of numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
