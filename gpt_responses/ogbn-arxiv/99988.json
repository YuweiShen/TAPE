The paper focuses on computer vision tasks and uses large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, Places, and MS1M. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves developing a new algorithm, which suggests it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses memory features and a learned metric, which could suggest it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves handling open-set recognition, which could suggest it belongs to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
