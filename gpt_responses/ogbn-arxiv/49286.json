This involves selecting an optimal prediction from a set of prediction candidates generated by directional predictive modes, followed by scalar quantization. Information theory concepts such as rate distortion performance are also mentioned in the abstract. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with compressive sensing of natural images, which is a common topic in computer vision. The proposed coding strategy involves exploiting spatial correlation in images, which is a key concept in computer vision. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with compressive sensing of natural images, which is a common topic in multimedia. The proposed coding strategy involves exploiting spatial correlation in images, which is a key concept in multimedia. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel coding strategy for compressive sensing, which involves selecting an optimal prediction from a set of prediction candidates generated by directional predictive modes. This could potentially involve machine learning techniques. \n5. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with compressive sensing of natural images, which is a common topic in signal processing. The proposed coding strategy involves exploiting spatial correlation in images, which is a key concept in signal processing.
