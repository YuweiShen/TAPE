The paper introduces a new and more general barrier, providing stronger limitations than in previous work, and introduces the notion of \"irreversibility\" of a tensor. The paper discusses barriers on the group-theoretic approach in terms of \"monomial\" irreversibility. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
