The paper also discusses the use of fuzzy systems, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed strategy involves identifying patches that contribute the most to the learning error, which is a problem that can be addressed using neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of ensemble learning, which is a topic that falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on regression problems, which is a topic that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
