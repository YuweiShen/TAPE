The use of softmax relaxation and entropic regularization also suggests a focus on optimization and information theory, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.IT and cs.MA. The paper's title and abstract mention the equivalence between policy gradients and soft Q-learning, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the use of convex analysis and policy inequality suggests a focus on control and optimization, which are relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
