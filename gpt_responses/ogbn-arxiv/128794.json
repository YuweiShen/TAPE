The use of deep convolutional neural networks also suggests that it may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses modifications to existing datasets, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. The use of committee machine techniques for combining local and global decisions suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential security implications of facial attribute detection, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
