The paper proposes a novel approach that integrates a sparsity-driven 3D geometric prior and temporal smoothness, which involves training a deep fully convolutional network (cs.LG). The paper also uses an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for inference (cs.RO), and the approach involves treating the image locations of the joints as latent variables (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on the Human3.6M dataset and the PennAction dataset, which are both related to computer vision and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
