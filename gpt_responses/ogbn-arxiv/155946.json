This work involves several aspects of computer science, including artificial intelligence (AI) for the neural network agent, robotics (RO) for the autonomous vehicle, machine learning (LG) for the deep reinforcement learning approach, systems and control (SY) for the control approach, and computer vision (CV) for obstacle detection. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.SY, and cs.CV, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
