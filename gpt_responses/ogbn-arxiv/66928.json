The proposed solution involves the use of machine learning tools, specifically deep learning, to predict blockages and enable proactive handoff, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the issues of reliability and latency in mobile mmWave systems, which are related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
