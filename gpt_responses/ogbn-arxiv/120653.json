Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of a system for mechanically inserting security workarounds into applications, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of error-handling code within applications, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on popular Linux server applications, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
