Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the theoretical framework based on network information theory, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiuser detection strategy at the receiver, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
