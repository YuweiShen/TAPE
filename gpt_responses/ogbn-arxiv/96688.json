This involves analyzing video data to track facial features and body movements, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The goal is to provide a non-invasive and efficient method for early detection of ASD, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of algorithms to analyze and interpret behavioral data also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of these tools to clinical settings involves robotics and automation (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
