The methodology involves the use of deep learning-based sequence tagger and simple heuristic rule-based relation extractor. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves the use of natural language processing techniques for extracting information from scientific literature. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning-based sequence tagger for entity recognition. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the extraction of information from scientific literature. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning and natural language processing techniques for automated information extraction. \n- cs.DL (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning-based sequence tagger for entity recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
