The paper proposes a deep learning solution to optimise the allocation of resources, which involves the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and the development of a rate utility framework (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of a 'sanity check' routine to regulate the inferences made by the neural network, which involves the use of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using experiments, which involves the use of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
