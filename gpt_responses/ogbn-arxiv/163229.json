The proposed algorithm uses optimization and machine learning (MM) methods to estimate the blur model variables jointly. The problem also involves robotics (RO) since it deals with camera motion. Finally, the algorithm uses multi-view nature of light fields, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI) for depth estimation and 3D reconstruction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
