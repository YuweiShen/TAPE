Additionally, the paper uses theoretical tools from statistical physics, which could place it in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. The paper also discusses the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which is related to information theory, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category.
