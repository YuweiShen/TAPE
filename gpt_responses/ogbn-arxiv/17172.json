The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed IR in terms of performance, code size, and compilation time, which falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the proposed IR in deep learning, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category, and provides examples of optimizations that can be performed using the IR, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
