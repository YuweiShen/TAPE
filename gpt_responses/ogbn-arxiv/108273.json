The paper also addresses the problem of training a large number of parameters in deep neural networks, which is a common challenge in machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed architecture includes wavelet neurons with learnable parameters, which is a technique used in neural network optimization (cs.NE). The paper evaluates the performance of the introduced network using common image datasets, which is a common practice in artificial intelligence research (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves signal processing techniques such as wavelet decomposition, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
