The paper focuses on semantic segmentation tasks and proposes a new loss function that can be integrated into any popular segmentation network without requiring additional annotation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
