The reduction presented in the paper is based on elementary techniques, which suggests that it may be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper also discusses the hardness of asymptotically good codes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
