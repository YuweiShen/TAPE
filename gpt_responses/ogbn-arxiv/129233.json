This is a common problem in computer vision (CV) and machine learning (LG) research. The paper also mentions using a gradient ascent algorithm, which is a common optimization technique in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Additionally, the paper involves working with image datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (MM) research. Finally, the paper involves information theory, which is a common topic in information retrieval (IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
