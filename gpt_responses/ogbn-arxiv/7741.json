This involves the use of novel patch antenna prototypes and analog baseband cancellation techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. The paper also involves the use of wireless testbed implementations, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The proposed techniques for complementing RF cancellation fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control), while the use of patch antenna prototypes falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves the design of radios with self-interference in mind, which falls under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
