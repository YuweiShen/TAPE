Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with symbolic data, which is a common topic in the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Symbolic Computation (cs.SC). The use of neural networks also falls under the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a general method that can be applied to various practical cases, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) as well as Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
