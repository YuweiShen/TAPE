The authors propose a novel explanation technique for classifiers, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). They also demonstrate the flexibility of their method by explaining models for text and image classification, which are subfields of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), respectively. Finally, the paper discusses scenarios that require trust, which could fall under the category of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
