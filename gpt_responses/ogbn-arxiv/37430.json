This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses safety-critical domains, which could also place it under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
