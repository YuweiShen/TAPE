The use of the deep Taylor / LRP technique to understand the network's classification decisions suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper specifically mentions analyzing neural networks for video data (cs.MM) and improving classifier accuracy (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
