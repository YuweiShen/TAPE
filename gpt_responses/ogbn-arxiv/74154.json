Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a simple reconstruction trick to build minimal pairs of plausible and implausible texts, which involves generating and ranking text, indicating that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The paper also discusses the use of contextual discourse clues, which suggests that it may belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with argumentation, which may place it in the category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
