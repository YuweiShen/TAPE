The paper also discusses the complexity of data repair, which is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper proposes new constructions for exact-MSR codes, which is a topic related to coding theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI).
