The paper provides a general framework for computing lower-bounds on the sample complexity of recovering the underlying graphs of Ising models, given i.i.d samples. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with information-theoretic limits, which makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves graph theory and structural properties of graphs, which makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper involves the use of corollaries and extensions to novel graph classes, which makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
