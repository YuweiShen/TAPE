The authors propose a framework based on optimization problems and regularization terms, which is a common approach in machine learning and optimization (cs.CY). The paper also discusses the theoretical guarantees of the proposed framework, which is related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the authors evaluate their approach on real-world datasets, which is a common practice in data science and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
