The use of higher arity operators is particularly relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the optimization of functions, which is relevant to the sub-category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the use of black-box models and optimization algorithms is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
