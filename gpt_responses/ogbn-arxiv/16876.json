The topic is closely related to database systems (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS), as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of tree automata. Additionally, the paper discusses implementation techniques for efficient evaluation, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
