This involves information theory concepts such as rate-distortion theory and channel coding. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new architecture for the mmWave-based CRAN with advanced lens antenna arrays at the RRHs, which is a cost-effective solution to achieve network densification. The paper also discusses the fronthaul links in a CRAN and their impact on network performance. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a channel estimation technique that exploits the energy focusing property of the lens array and can be implemented at the CU with low complexity. This involves control theory concepts such as system identification and estimation. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mmWave communication for achieving high-rate communication in next-generation wireless networks. This involves multimedia applications such as video streaming and high-quality audio. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes the use of advanced lens antenna arrays at the RRHs, which involves hardware architecture design and implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
