The use of deep learning models such as Mask-RCNN and U-Net suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of these techniques in the medical field suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of medical imaging (cs.MED). The development of computer-aided diagnosis systems suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of MRI images suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
