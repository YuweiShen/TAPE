The codes are designed to have good error correcting and detecting capabilities, which is a concern in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves the study of cyclotomic classes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The codes are constructed using algebraic techniques, which is a topic in symbolic computation (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the study of linear codes, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
