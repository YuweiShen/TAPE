This involves processing and searching large collections of unconstrained face images, which is a problem in computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves searching for images on a large scale, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper proposes a system that combines deep features and a commercial off-the-shelf matcher, which could be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
