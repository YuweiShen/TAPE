This is a classic topic in game theory and matching theory.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Hospital Residents problem is a classic problem in AI and has been extensively studied in the literature. The paper proposes a new variant of the problem and provides algorithms for solving it.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms for computing popular matchings in the generalized Hospital Residents setting. This is a classic topic in algorithms and data structures.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a matching problem in a bipartite graph and proposes a new notion of optimality (popularity).
