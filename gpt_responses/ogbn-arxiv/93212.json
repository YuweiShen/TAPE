The proposed method involves quantization of weight parameters and activations, which is also relevant to the field of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the hardware implications of the proposed method, which could be relevant to the field of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
