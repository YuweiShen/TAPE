The paper also mentions the use of information theory (cs.IT) in the analysis of the algorithm. Additionally, the paper's focus on the expressivity of neural networks and their ability to learn various functions suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
