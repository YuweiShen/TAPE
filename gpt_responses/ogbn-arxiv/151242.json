The use of Convolutional Neural Nets and Conditional Random Fields also suggests that the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The focus on tracking multiple targets across multiple cameras suggests that the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for multi-camera multi-target detection suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
