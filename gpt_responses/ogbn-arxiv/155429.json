Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also discusses the improvement of model efficiency and performance, which falls under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of ResNet and ResNeXt architectures, which are commonly used in multimedia applications, indicating a possible fit for cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also discusses the reduction of word error rates in speech recognition, indicating a possible fit for cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
