Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also mentions term rewriting systems, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of a proof assistant for formalization suggests cs.SE (Software Engineering) as another likely category. The paper also deals with correctness verification, which is relevant to cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
