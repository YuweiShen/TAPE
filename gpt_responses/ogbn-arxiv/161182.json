The paper also discusses compressive sensing techniques, which fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of super-sampling and the adaptation of resolution and exposure-time suggest a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and optics and photonics (cs.OH). Finally, the paper's discussion of computational imagers suggests a potential fit with signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
