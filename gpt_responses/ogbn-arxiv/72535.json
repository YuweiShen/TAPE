The use of uncertainty estimates is also a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG), and the paper specifically uses Monte Carlo dropout, which is a technique for estimating uncertainty in neural networks (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with medical imaging datasets, which is a common topic in both computer vision and medical informatics (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses a proprietary dataset, which suggests that it may have industry or clinical applications, making it relevant to the neural engineering community (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
