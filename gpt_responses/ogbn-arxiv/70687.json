The proposed mathematical model and algorithm for detecting and thickening thin features also involve image processing and computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The discussion on the importance of this analysis in the design of robust structures and additive manufacturing technology suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the algorithmic approach and mathematical model used in the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
