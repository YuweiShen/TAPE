This involves developing a novel algorithm that allows agents to communicate only arm-ids and not samples, with another agent chosen uniformly and independently at random. The paper also discusses the per-agent regret scaling achieved by the algorithm and compares it to two benchmarks. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
