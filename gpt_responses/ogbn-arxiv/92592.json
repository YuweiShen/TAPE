It proposes a method to overcome this hurdle using leverage score sampling and gradient coding. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a method for distributed optimization using gradient coding and discusses the issue of stragglers in a distributed network. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of coding matrices in gradient coding to make computations resilient to stragglers. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a method for compressing a data matrix using leverage score sampling, which is a technique from linear algebra. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the issue of system performance degradation due to stragglers in a distributed network and proposes a method to overcome this issue using gradient coding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
