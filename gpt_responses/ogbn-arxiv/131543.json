The paper applies this network to a music source separation task, which could also be considered a computer vision task. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed framework involves passing the estimated mask through stacked hourglass modules for refinement, which could be seen as a control system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
