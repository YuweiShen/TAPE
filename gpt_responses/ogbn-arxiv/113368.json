The use of tournaments as a model for ranking also suggests the category of computational geometry (cs.CG), which often deals with geometric structures that can be used to model combinatorial problems. The paper's focus on approximation algorithms and techniques for dealing with constraints could also place it in the category of algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
