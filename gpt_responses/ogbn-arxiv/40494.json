These are techniques commonly used in computer vision, which falls under the cs.CV sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks and deep learning, which are topics commonly found in the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the performance of existing object detection frameworks, which falls under the cs.RO sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed models on two popular datasets, which is relevant to the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
