Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses custom hardware implementation, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper mentions convolutional and recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, respectively, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
