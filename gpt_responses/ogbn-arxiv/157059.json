The paper focuses on exploration in reinforcement learning, which is a key problem in machine learning. The paper discusses the use of multiple models and how to combine them to achieve near-optimal reward with high probability. This work is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and probabilistic methods (cs.ML)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
