This involves studying continuous analogues of \"\"vitality\"\" for discrete network flows/paths and extending the graph-theoretic notion of \"\"most vital arcs\"\" to geometric environments. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and hardness results, which suggests that it could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Graph Theory (cs.GT), and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
