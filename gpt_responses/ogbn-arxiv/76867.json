It also involves the use of state embedding, reward shaping, and policy learning modules, which are common techniques in machine learning. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which is a common practice in machine learning research. \n\nThe paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the development of a meta policy for RL problems, which is a common topic in AI research. The use of state embedding and reward shaping techniques also aligns with the AI research focus on developing intelligent agents that can learn and adapt to different environments. \n\nFurthermore, the paper could belong to cs.RO (Robotics) as RL is a common technique used in robotics for developing autonomous agents. The proposed framework could be applied to robotics problems with sparse reward, such as navigation tasks. \n\nThe paper could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as RL is a common technique used in control systems for developing adaptive controllers. The proposed framework could be applied to control problems with sparse reward, such as controlling a system with limited feedback. \n\nFinally, the paper could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as RL is a common technique used in computer vision for developing agents that can"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
