The approach involves combining intermediate representations of base networks, which is a technique used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses joint learning of deep and shallow base networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is evaluated on image classification tasks, which is a common application of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper compares the proposed approach to state-of-the-art methods in computer vision, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
