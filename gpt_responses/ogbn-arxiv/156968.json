This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also involves mathematical analysis and modeling, which could be categorized under graph theory (cs.GT) and mathematical software (cs.MS). Additionally, the paper discusses the Shannon capacity of the correlated $\\kappa-\\mu$ shadowed channels, which could be classified under signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
