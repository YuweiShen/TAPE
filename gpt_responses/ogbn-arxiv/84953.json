The paper specifically focuses on achieving open vocabulary NMT, which involves handling rare and unknown words. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG), as NMT is typically implemented using deep learning techniques. Additionally, the paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines word-level and character-level models, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a translation task, which could also make it relevant to the sub-category of \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV), as machine translation can be seen as a form of image-to-text translation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
