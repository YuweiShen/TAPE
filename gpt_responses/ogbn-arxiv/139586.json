The use of a dynamic sequence matching technique and an automatic weighting scheme also suggests a potential application of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple benchmark datasets involves the analysis of performance metrics, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
