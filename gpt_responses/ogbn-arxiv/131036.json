The paper also discusses the implementation of low-precision fixed-point arithmetic, which is relevant to computer architecture (cs.AR). Additionally, the paper evaluates the effect of limited precision on classification accuracy, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of hardware accelerators is also discussed, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
