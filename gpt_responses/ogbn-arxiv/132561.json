The paper also focuses on the interaction between waves and a trainable medium, which suggests a potential application in optics (cs.Optics). The use of waves and propagation also suggests a potential application in signal processing (cs.SI) and wave propagation (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses a potential way to build such a device in an integrated photonics chip, which suggests a potential application in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
