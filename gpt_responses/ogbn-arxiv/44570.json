Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning and neural networks, which are common in the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of object proposal methods, which are commonly used in sub-categories cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
