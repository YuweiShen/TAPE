The focus is on image processing and specifically on removing perspective distortion from hand-held camera captured document images. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions that the proposed method is trained end-to-end in a fully automatic way, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques. Additionally, the paper introduces a large scale synthetic dataset, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) or machine learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
