The use of topological methods in a previous work and the development of an algorithm also suggest that it could belong to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the mention of a general framework for solving similar problems suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
