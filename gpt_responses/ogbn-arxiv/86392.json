The use of weights assigned to different body parts also suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories may be relevant. Additionally, the use of video data suggests that multimedia (cs.MM) may also be relevant. Finally, the focus on human perception and recognition suggests that human-computer interaction (cs.HC) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
