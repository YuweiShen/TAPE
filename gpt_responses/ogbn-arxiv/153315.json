The proposed technique involves image representation and feature extraction, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of different sensors, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
