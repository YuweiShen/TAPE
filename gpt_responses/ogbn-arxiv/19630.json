It also involves information theory (cs.IT) in the modeling of the information as a deck of cards. The problem of distributing the information among a group of agents can be seen as a distributed computing problem (cs.DC) and a data structure problem (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a protocol that involves probability and statistical analysis, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
