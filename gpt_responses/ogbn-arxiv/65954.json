The focus on visualizing documents and comparing them suggests that it could belong to Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) or Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The use of algorithms and evaluation methods suggests that it could also belong to Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Deep Learning (cs.DL), or Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
