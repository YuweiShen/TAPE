The paper also discusses various threat models and attack methods, which are relevant to computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves image classification tasks, which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed framework, Athena, involves building ensembles of weak defenses, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
