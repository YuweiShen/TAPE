The approach involves using a multipath fingerprint database, which is a technique used in wireless communication systems (cs.MM). The paper also discusses optimizing candidate beam selection and evaluating the proposed approach using realistic channels generated from a commercial ray-tracing simulator, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
