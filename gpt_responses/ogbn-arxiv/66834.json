It uses computational methods to measure editors' online ideological preferences and surveys to associate them with offline political party affiliation and ideological self-identity. The paper also analyzes article 'talk pages' to reveal that ideologically polarized teams engage in longer, more constructive, competitive, and substantively focused but linguistically diverse debates than teams of ideological moderates. Therefore, this paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Cybernetics (cs.CY), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Systems and Control (cs.SD), Social and Economic Networks (cs.SOC), and Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
