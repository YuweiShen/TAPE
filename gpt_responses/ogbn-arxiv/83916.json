The use of human demonstrations also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The dataset and helper code provided can be used for machine learning tasks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also mentions the importance of facilitating research on task-oriented interactive manipulation, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
