The paper also discusses the behavior of the matching probability, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS). The use of relative entropies and rate functions suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The consideration of stationary and ergodic sources suggests a connection to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the use of abstract alphabets and unbounded distortion measures suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
