The paper also focuses on optimizing sensing parameters for blind spectrum sensing techniques and introduces a two-stage fully-blind self-adapted sensing algorithm. These topics are related to network infrastructure (NI), information theory (IT), cryptography and security (CR), multimedia (MM), and systems and control (SY). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI, followed by cs.IT, cs.CR, cs.MM, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
