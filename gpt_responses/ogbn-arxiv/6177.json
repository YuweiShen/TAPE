The use of probability densities and thresholds in the queries suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The construction of coresets involves geometric considerations, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the use of discrepancy-based approaches suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
