The paper proposes a system that enables CSPs to disclose detailed information about their offered security services in an encrypted form to ensure data confidentiality, which involves techniques such as Secure Two Party Computation (2PC) and Searchable Encryption. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) and \"Software Engineering\" (cs.SE) due to the distributed nature of the proposed system and the use of encryption techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of standardized SLAs, which could fall under \"Computers and Society\" (cs.CY) as it deals with the social and ethical implications of cloud computing. Finally, the paper involves the use of databases to store and retrieve encrypted information, which could also fall under \"Databases\" (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
