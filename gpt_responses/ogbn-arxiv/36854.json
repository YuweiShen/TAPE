This is a core topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the delivery of content to multiple users, which is a key problem in networking. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper considers the use of caches at the user end, which is a common feature in social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a delivery scheme that combines superposition coding and power allocation, which involves algorithmic design. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with content delivery, which is a key aspect of multimedia systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
