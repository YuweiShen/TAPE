The paper also discusses approximate versions of fairness notions, which are relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The techniques used in the paper involve mathematical optimization and algorithms, which are common in the fields of computer science (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also discusses the concept of maximin share fairness, which is a topic in the field of mechanism design (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
