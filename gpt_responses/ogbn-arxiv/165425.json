The paper also discusses the secretary problem, which is a classic problem in computer science and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of probability and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
