The paper presents an approach for one-shot learning from a video of a human by using human and robot demonstration data from a variety of previous tasks to build up prior knowledge through meta-learning. This involves adapting to changes in perspective, environment, and embodiment between the robot and the observed human. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
