The algorithm presented in the paper is specifically designed for detecting selfish nodes in a WMN. Therefore, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with the issue of selfish nodes in a WMN, which can severely degrade the network's throughput. The proposed algorithm is a trust-based detection algorithm, which suggests that security is an important aspect of the paper. Therefore, cs.CR is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents an algorithm for detecting selfish nodes in a WMN. The algorithm is based on statistical theory of inference and uses local observations for reliable clustering of the nodes. Therefore, cs.DS is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the issue of throughput degradation in a WMN due to selfish nodes. The proposed algorithm is based on statistical theory of inference, which suggests that information theory may be relevant to this paper. Therefore, cs.IT is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the issue of"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
