This is a core topic in robotics, and hence cs.RO is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper is based on robust control theory and convex optimization, which are key topics in systems and control. The paper also deals with uncertainties in the environment, robot parameters, sensors, and actuators, which are typical challenges in control systems. Hence, cs.SY is the second most likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of optimization techniques and the focus on performance requirements suggest that machine learning techniques may be relevant. Hence, cs.LG is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to tackle the challenges of controlling contacts, which involves dealing with uncertainties and optimizing performance. These are key topics in artificial intelligence, and hence cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the tasks of robot hand guiding and sliding on surfaces with different and unknown stiffnesses may involve visual sensing. Hence, cs.CV is a possible sub"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
