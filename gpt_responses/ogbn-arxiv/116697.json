The use of fixed-length code words and the representation of a large number of values suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The focus on the spread of the coding schemes may also relate to distributed computing (cs.DC) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
