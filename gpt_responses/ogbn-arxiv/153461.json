The study uses a data-driven Cox Proportional Hazards model with a flexible non-linear deep neural network to analyze pedestrian wait time behavior. The interpretability method used in the study is game theoretic based. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Cybernetics (cs.CY), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
