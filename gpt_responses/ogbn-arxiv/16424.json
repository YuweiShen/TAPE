This method is evaluated using coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans to detect six clinically relevant landmarks in the heart. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper uses a neural network for classification and regression, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NEURAL (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, since the paper focuses on medical image analysis, it could also belong to cs.Medical Imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
