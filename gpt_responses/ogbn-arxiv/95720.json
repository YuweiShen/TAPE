This involves analyzing the visual content of the video, which falls under the scope of computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with summarizing user-generated sports videos, which are a type of multimedia content. The proposed method involves analyzing both visual and audio features of the video to determine the highlights. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a deep neural network-based approach to extract action-related features and classify video segments. This involves training a machine learning model to recognize patterns in the data. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with summarizing videos, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. The proposed method aims to extract the most important parts of the video, which can be useful for users who want to quickly get an overview of the content. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper considers the case of Kendo as an example of a sport to evaluate the proposed method. This involves understanding the needs and preferences of users who are interested in Kendo, which falls under the scope of human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
