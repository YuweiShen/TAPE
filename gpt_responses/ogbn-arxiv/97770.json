The paper discusses the Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm and proposes a simplification of it called ANIL. The paper also includes experiments on few-shot image classification and reinforcement learning. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
