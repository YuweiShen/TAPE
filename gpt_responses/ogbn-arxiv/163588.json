This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper proposes a low-complexity iterative algorithm for solving the detection problem, which is a key aspect of communication and networking systems.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed algorithm is based on a well-known machine learning approach, i.e., variational inference. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the machine learning community.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with a detection problem in a communication system, which can be viewed as a control problem. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the systems and control community.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with spatial modulation, which is a technique used in wireless communication systems. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the multimedia community, which deals with various forms of digital communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
