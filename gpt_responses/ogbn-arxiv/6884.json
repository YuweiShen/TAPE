This falls under the scope of natural language processing and speech synthesis, which is a subfield of cs.CL.\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper is about generating audio, specifically speech, which falls under the scope of cs.SD (Sound).\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions that the short vector used to represent speakers can be fitted to new identities, even with only a few samples. This suggests that the method may have applications in social networks or information networks, which falls under the scope of cs.SI.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new neural network architecture for text to speech synthesis, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning).\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper is not directly related to computer vision, it does mention that the same buffer is used for estimating attention, which is a concept commonly used in computer vision tasks. However, this is less likely than the other categories mentioned above."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
