The paper uses reinforcement learning algorithm with policy gradients to train the network due to the lack of ground truth annotations of the visual attention mechanism. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
