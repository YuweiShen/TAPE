It also involves algorithms and computational complexity (cs.DS), as the authors discuss the runtime of their proposed mechanisms. The use of Bayesian mechanisms and the consideration of bidder-symmetric and item-symmetric distributions suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with economic concepts such as demand constraints and revenue, indicating a connection to computational economics (cs.EC). Finally, the authors mention a technique for turning an eps-BIC mechanism into a truly-BIC mechanism, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
