It also discusses the challenges faced in developing efficient protocols for addressing and routing due to power supply considerations. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it discusses the use of an external symbol generator and the impact on power consumption. \n\ncs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible sub-category as the paper proposes a new system architecture for wireless communications. \n\ncs.AR (Hardware Architecture) is also a possibility as the paper proposes a new adapter architecture. \n\nFinally, cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) could be a potential sub-category as the paper evaluates the performance of the new adapters in a simulated multi-hop network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
