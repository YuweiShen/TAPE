The paper proposes a novel methodology to automatically detect prediction-quality degradation of machine learning models due to class-based concept drift. The paper uses synthetic and real-world public datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
