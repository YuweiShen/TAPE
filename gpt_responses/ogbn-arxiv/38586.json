Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of neural networks, indicating that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The use of parallelism in training the networks suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the potential for training larger networks on larger training sets, indicating that it may belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the research, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
