The paper also discusses the optimality of Bayesian predictors, which is a topic that is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the analysis of cumulative loss, which is a concept that is relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS).
