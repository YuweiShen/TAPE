The paper also discusses the use of custom 3D DRAM and ASICs, which falls under the category of computer architecture and embedded systems. Therefore, cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the cognitive capabilities of the model, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for field deployment, which falls under the category of control systems and robotics.
