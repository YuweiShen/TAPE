The paper proposes a novel class of independence structures called \"riffled independence\" and presents algorithms for using it within Fourier-theoretic frameworks. The paper also proposes an automated method for discovering sets of items which are riffle independent from a training set of rankings. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
