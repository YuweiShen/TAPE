The paper also discusses the weight distribution of the codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The construction of an infinite family of codes is based on combinatorial designs, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the applications of minimal linear codes in secret sharing and secure two-party computation, which are topics in security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
