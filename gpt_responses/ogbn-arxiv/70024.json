The use of subdivision atlases and soft predicates suggests a computational geometry (cs.CG) approach. The algorithms are rigorous and complete, indicating the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The practical implementation and comparison with state-of-the-art planners suggest a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. Finally, the extension of feature-based techniques for collision detection suggests a computer vision (cs.CV) angle."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
