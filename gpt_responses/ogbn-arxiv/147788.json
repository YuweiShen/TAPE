The proposed framework involves statistical hypothesis testing and selective inference, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the application of the framework to medical images, which falls under the sub-category of medical imaging (cs.MS). Finally, the use of statistical methods to evaluate segmentation results may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) used for image segmentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
