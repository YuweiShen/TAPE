This involves the use of a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that preserves learned contexts during training and observes the entire image to detect global and local shadow patterns simultaneously. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, since the proposed method involves the use of deep learning, it is also likely to belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on publicly available datasets, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
