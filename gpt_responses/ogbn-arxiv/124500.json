The paper also mentions model-driven development (cs.SD) and self-adaptive software systems, which are relevant subfields of software engineering. The use of multiple runtime models and their relations also touches upon distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses automation and organization of models, which are relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
