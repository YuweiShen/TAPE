The paper also discusses the modification of default parameters of the selected protocols, which falls under the category of network optimization and control. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other possible sub-categories include cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these subfields are also relevant to the study of mobile ad-hoc networks and routing protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
