The paper also introduces new concepts and connections between the two methodologies, which could be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. Additionally, the paper proposes modified CNN models that exhibit better performance, which could be relevant to the statistical learning (cs.SI) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
