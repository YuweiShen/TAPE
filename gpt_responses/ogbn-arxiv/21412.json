The use of matrix decompositions and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The focus on MIMO systems and channel decomposition also suggests that the paper may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
