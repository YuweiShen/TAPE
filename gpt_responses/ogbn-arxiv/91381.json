The use of feedback channel and investigation of achievable decoding error exponent also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The mention of transmission of nonexponential number of messages and the use of a specific method for transmission/decoding also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
