The proposed method involves using dense correspondences between image points and a body surface, which can be annotated on in-the-wild 2D images, and extracting and aggregating 3D information from them, which involves graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) techniques. The method also involves training deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.MM, cs.LG, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
