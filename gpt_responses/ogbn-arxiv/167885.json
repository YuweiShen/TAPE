This involves decomposing the original time series into multiple time series and utilizing their complementary information. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as multi-task learning and multi-view learning, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper deals with time series data, which is a common topic in the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SP) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
