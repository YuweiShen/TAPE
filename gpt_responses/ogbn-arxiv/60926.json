The paper presents theoretical results on the performance of three different algorithms for incentivized exploration (UCB, $\\varepsilon$-Greedy, and Thompson Sampling) under reward drift, which is a common issue in real-world applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.GT (Game Theory). The paper also involves some analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithms, which suggests a possible connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
