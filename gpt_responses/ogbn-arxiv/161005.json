The techniques used in the paper involve deep hole trees, which are a type of data structure (cs.DS). The paper also makes use of results related to the Erd\u0151s-Heilbronn conjecture, which is a topic in combinatorics (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper involves complexity analysis and proving NP-completeness, which are topics in computational complexity (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves classification of deep holes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
