The paper also introduces a new class of functions called sparse juntas, which are a natural extension of juntas. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry), as these sub-categories are closely related to the topics discussed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
