The use of paraconsistent logics is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed approach using Clingo, which is a solver for answer set programming (cs.PL) and the Asprin add-on, which is a tool for non-monotonic reasoning (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
