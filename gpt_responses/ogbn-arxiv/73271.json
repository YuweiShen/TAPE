The paper also discusses optimization problems and LP relaxations, which are common in optimization and mathematical programming (cs.ITP). The paper mentions the use of Hamming distortion, which is a measure of error in digital communication and is relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM). The paper also discusses multi-terminal settings, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.SI).
