The approach involves learning local controllers using graph neural networks, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of linear quadratic regulator and flocking controllers, which are control theory concepts (cs.SY). The use of aggregation graph neural networks to learn a single common local controller involves optimization and mathematical modeling (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the imitation of centralized controllers using global information, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
