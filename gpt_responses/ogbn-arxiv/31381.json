The analysis is focused on the effects of channel degradations, which are related to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system design (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of orthogonal space-time block codes, which is a technique in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents results on the capacity of MIMO systems, which is a topic in communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
