It also involves the adaptation of pulse shapes to the second order statistics of the channel, which is related to signal processing (cs.SD). The use of unitary representations of the Weyl-Heisenberg group suggests a connection to mathematical analysis and numerical algorithms (cs.NA). The reformulation of the problem as a differential equation and the identification of optimal pulses as eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian suggest a connection to control theory and systems theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of operator-algebraic methods to provide exact solutions for different classes of scattering environments suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
