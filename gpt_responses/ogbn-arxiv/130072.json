It also involves the use of redundancy and error correction techniques (cs.IT), as well as distributed storage and data management (cs.DC). The paper proposes a new approach to achieving improved repairing locality, which may involve computational complexity and algorithm design (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of the proposed scheme, which may involve privacy and confidentiality concerns (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
