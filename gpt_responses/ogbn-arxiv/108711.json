It also involves the use of graphs and digraphs, which are commonly studied in computer science (cs.NI, cs.DS). The paper proposes a new scheme that outperforms existing graph-based schemes, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides theoretical results on the optimality of scalar linear index codes, which is related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
