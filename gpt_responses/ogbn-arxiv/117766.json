It could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it proposes a new approach to detecting attacks in web applications. Additionally, the use of sensors and automation in the proposed system suggests it could be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the zero-configuration capability of the system could make it relevant to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
