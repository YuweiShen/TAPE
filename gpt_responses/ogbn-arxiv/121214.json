The paper specifically focuses on batch active learning, which involves selecting batches of samples to label at once, and using Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to generate diverse batches. DPPs are a probabilistic model, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The experiments in the paper are conducted on image datasets, which are typically categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and involve natural language processing, which falls under cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
