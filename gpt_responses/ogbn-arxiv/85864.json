It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it uses Seq2Seq models and Determinantal Point Processes methods for training. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves developing models that can generate summaries with a high level of abstraction. It could also be classified under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it deals with summarizing large amounts of text. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it uses neural networks for training the models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
