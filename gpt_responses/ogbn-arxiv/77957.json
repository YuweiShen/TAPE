The focus is on higher-order dependencies, which are important in understanding complex systems, including social networks. \n2. cs.SD (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a novel adaptive sampling framework and unbiased estimators for higher-order network analysis. This could be relevant to software engineering, where network analysis is used in various applications such as software testing and debugging. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator to minimize the estimation error. This is a common technique in machine learning for improving the accuracy of estimates. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes computationally efficient algorithms for analyzing large streaming networks. This could be relevant to data structures and algorithms, where efficient algorithms are important for processing large datasets. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a framework for incrementally updating the analysis of streaming networks. This could be relevant to systems and control, where incremental updates are important for real-time decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
