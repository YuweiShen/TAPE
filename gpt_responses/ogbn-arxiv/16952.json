The use of the replica method to evaluate the spectral efficiency is a common technique in statistical physics and machine learning, which are also relevant fields for this paper (cs.MA and cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the asymptotic behavior of the channel in terms of the number of users and antennas, which is a topic related to networked systems and networking (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
