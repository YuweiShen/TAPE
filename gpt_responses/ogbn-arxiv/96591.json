This involves utilizing prior knowledge from past learned policies of relevant tasks to optimize the target policy. The paper also mentions the use of deep reinforcement learning approaches. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves modeling multi-policy transfer as an option learning problem, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the transfer involves visual inputs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
