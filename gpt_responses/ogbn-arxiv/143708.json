The paper also proposes a novel approach for ensuring safety in learned control policies, which is a key challenge in reinforcement learning and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is based on online computation and decision-making, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.LG, cs.MA). Finally, the approach is designed to ensure safety in dynamic environments, which involves control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
