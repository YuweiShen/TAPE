This suggests that the paper may belong to the Database sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes heuristic approaches to solve the multi-skill spatial crowdsourcing problem, which involves finding an optimal worker-and-task assignment strategy. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the complexity of the multi-skill spatial crowdsourcing problem and proposes heuristic approaches to solve it. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a spatial crowdsourcing scenario, which involves sending location-based requests to workers. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Social and Information Networks sub-category. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the problem of multi-skill spatial crowdsourcing, which involves finding an optimal worker-and-task assignment strategy that maximizes workers' benefits.
