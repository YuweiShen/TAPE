The focus is on the space complexity of detectable algorithms, which is a fundamental issue in the design of such systems. The paper presents new wait-free bounded-space detectable object implementations, and proves lower bounds on the bit complexity of detectable CAS implementations. The paper also discusses the external support required by detectable implementations, which is relevant to the design of distributed systems. Overall, the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in several areas of computer science, including distributed computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), operating systems (cs.OS), cryptography (cs.CR), and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
