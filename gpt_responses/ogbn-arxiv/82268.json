Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the impact of user selection, spatial correlation, and multi-user diversity, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also mentions multi-stream multiplexing and receive combining, which are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
