The paper proposes a peer-to-peer approach for data exchange among on-board units (OBUs) to complement missing packets during vehicle-to-roadside broadcasting. The paper also introduces a coalitional graph game to model the cooperation among OBUs and proposes a coalition formation algorithm to implement the P2P approach. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also deals with game theory and coalition formation, which makes cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely sub-categories. The use of cognitive radio for vehicle-to-vehicle transmissions makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a P2P approach for popular content distribution, which involves data exchange among OBUs, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
