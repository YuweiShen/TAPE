The proposed tree-pruning scheme is aimed at reducing the decoding complexity, which is a common concern in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which is a common technique in communication systems (cs.SI). The upper bounding technique used in the proposed scheme is a form of optimization, which is a topic in computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed scheme, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
