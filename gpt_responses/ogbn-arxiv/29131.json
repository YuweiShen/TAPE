This involves constructing an unstructured simplicial spacetime mesh over an arbitrary simplicial space domain. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MS (Mathematical Software), cs.CE (Computational Engineering), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
