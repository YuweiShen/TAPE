This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper involves drawing graphs in the plane and limiting the number of edge crossings, which is a problem in computational geometry.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an algorithm to recognize optimal 1-planar graphs, which is a problem in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with graph reduction rules, which can be seen as a game between the algorithm and the graph. This falls under the scope of game theory.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the problem of recognizing optimal 1-planar graphs can be seen as a computational complexity problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
