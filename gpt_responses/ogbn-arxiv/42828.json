The paper proposes a new iterative algorithm for this problem, which is based on hard-thresholding of appropriate residuals. The paper also discusses the use of feature information to improve the performance of the algorithm. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
