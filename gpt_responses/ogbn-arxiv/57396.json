The paper also discusses the need for privacy and security in communication during times of civil strife, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The design of the delay-tolerant mesh network and the use of social graphs to deprioritize adversarial messages could also fall under the categories of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the simulation results and benchmarks presented in the paper could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
