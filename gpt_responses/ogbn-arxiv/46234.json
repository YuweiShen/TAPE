The model employs determinantal point process in the recommendation procedure to promote diversity of the recommendation results. The paper also proposes a Thompson sampling-type algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference to learn the model parameters. Theoretical regret analysis is also provided to guarantee the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper focuses on user experience and interaction, it is also likely to belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
