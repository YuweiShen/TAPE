The use of noise injection and label flipping to assess model relevance suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). The evaluation of the technique on real-world datasets and synthetic datasets in the binary classification setting suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
