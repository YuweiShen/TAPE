Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses reducing the number of parameters in the model, which is a common topic in machine learning and deep learning research, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The use of auto-sizing to achieve efficiency is a novel approach, which could also make cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper may also touch on computer vision (cs.CV) since the Transformer network has been applied to image captioning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
