The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) and machine learning algorithms (cs.LG, cs.AI) for improving the performance of neural ranking models. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of image captioning datasets (cs.CV) for weak supervision, indicating a potential connection to computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
