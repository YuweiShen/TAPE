It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MS) sub-category as it describes the use of Locally Scaled Diffusion Maps and Complementary Coordinates techniques to enhance sampling and generate start-points for the next generation of MD simulations. Additionally, it could belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category as it discusses the use of highly-optimised parallel MD code and their coupling to analysis tools based upon collective coordinates. The Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with the accurate sampling of the relevant regions on the potential energy surface, which requires numerical methods. Finally, the paper could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses the use of analysis tools to automatically analyse the generated trajectories and identify molecular conformational structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
