The paper also discusses the use of algebraic frameworks and extended Clifford algebras to study STBCs, which is a topic related to symbolic computation and algebraic geometry (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the proposed transmission scheme, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of cooperative diversity in wireless relay networks, which is a topic related to computer communications (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of differential encoding in the proposed transmission scheme, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
