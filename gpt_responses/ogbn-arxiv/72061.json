The focus on physical layer encryption and key generation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the practical implementation of lightweight security solutions may also be of interest to machine learning (cs.LG) researchers working on IoT devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
