The use of machine learning algorithms for screening also suggests that it could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of information retrieval techniques for screening, which could place it under information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper discusses the cost-effectiveness of using a hybrid approach, which could be relevant to the field of cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of this approach in various domains, which could place it under social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
