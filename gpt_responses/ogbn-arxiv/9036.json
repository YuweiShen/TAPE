The core SLAM system comprises a Bayesian attractor network that utilizes neural responses of head direction (HD) cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to represent the head direction and the position of the robot in the environment, respectively. Direct sparse method is employed to accurately and robustly estimate velocity information from a stereo camera. The paper involves computer vision (stereo camera), robotics (SLAM), and machine learning (neural networks), which are all covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), robotics (cs.RO), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
