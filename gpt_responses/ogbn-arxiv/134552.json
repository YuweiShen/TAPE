The paper's focus on event-triggered control and its comparison with model-based approaches suggests that cs.SY is the most likely category, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI, which are relevant to the use of deep reinforcement learning. The paper's application to nonlinear systems and robotics also makes cs.RO a likely category, while the use of neural networks in the DRL approach makes cs.NE a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
