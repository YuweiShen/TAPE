This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new strategy for improving pre-training, which involves clustering features and re-training a new network, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with image and video modalities, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on transfer learning experiments, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
