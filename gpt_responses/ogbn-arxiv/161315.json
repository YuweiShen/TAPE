This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This sub-category covers topics related to security and privacy, including attacks and defenses against malicious actors. The focus on detecting honeypots in Ethereum smart contracts fits well within this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence. The use of machine learning models for honeypot detection suggests that this paper could also belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category covers topics related to software development and maintenance, including testing and verification. The focus on analyzing contract behavior and extracting features for machine learning suggests that this paper could also belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. While the paper does not focus explicitly on algorithm design, the use of machine learning models suggests that this sub-category could also be relevant.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and implementation of programming languages.
