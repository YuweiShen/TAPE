This falls under the categories of software engineering (cs.SE), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), and programming languages (cs.PL). However, since the paper focuses on the software engineering aspects of deep learning development, cs.SE is the most likely category, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
