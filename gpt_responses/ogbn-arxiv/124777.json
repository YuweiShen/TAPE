The problem is formulated as a combinatorial group testing one, which is a well-studied problem in information theory (cs.IT). The focus on energy efficiency and low-energy wireless devices suggests a possible category of systems and control (cs.SI). The use of Kautz and Singleton's construction for coding theory suggests a possible category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the emphasis on encoding and decoding efficiency suggests a possible category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
