The paper also proposes a novel method for training deep models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve action recognition, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR).
