Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems. The paper also touches upon software engineering (cs.SE) issues related to building and testing spreadsheet models, as well as data management (cs.DB) challenges in handling inputs and outputs. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential risks and vulnerabilities of spreadsheet systems, which could fall under the sub-categories of cybersecurity (cs.CR) and cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
