Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses Gaussian-process models and Bayesian methods, which are common in machine learning and statistics, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories.
