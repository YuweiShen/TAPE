Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with the application of this technique in the field of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on two automotive datasets (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
