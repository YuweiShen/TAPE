It involves the use of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes for fronthaul multicast and cooperative transmissions. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper also involves multimedia content delivery and optimization, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also involves the use of variational reformulations and optimization techniques, which makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
