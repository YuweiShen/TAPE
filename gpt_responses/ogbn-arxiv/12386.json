This involves processing sensor data in real-time, which is a common problem in robotics and autonomous driving. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
