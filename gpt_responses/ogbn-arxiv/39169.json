This involves leveraging multi-relational embeddings to model semantic knowledge, which is a common theme in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), robotics (cs.RO), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
