The paper also mentions continuous control problems, which are often studied in robotics and control theory, indicating relevance to the subcategories of robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of meta-learning also suggests relevance to the subcategory of meta-learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on optimization and finding optimal policies suggests relevance to the subcategory of mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
