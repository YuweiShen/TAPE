The proposed system, IskiOS, is specifically designed for operating system kernels on the x86 processor, which falls under the category of operating systems (cs.OS). The paper also discusses the use of Intel's Memory Protection Keys (MPK) and Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), which are relevant to the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper presents a new system for protecting against memory safety errors, which is relevant to the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance overhead of the proposed system, which is relevant to the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
