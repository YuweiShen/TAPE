The proposed approach, Uncertainty Annotated Databases (UA-DBs), combines under- and over-approximations of certain answers to achieve reliability while maintaining performance. This topic is closely related to the field of database systems (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS) that are often used in these fields. Additionally, the paper discusses the security implications of uncertainty in data management, which is relevant to the field of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
