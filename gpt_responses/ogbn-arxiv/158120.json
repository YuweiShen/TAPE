The algorithms in question are also focused, meaning they select constraints to address violations, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The Lov\\'{a}sz Local Lemma, which is mentioned as a basis for some of the algorithms studied, is a tool used in combinatorics and theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The paper also introduces the concept of measure distortion, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and probability theory (cs.PR). Finally, the paper discusses the performance guarantees of the algorithms, which is a topic commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
