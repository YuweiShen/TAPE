Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the integration of these languages and systems, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions scheduling problems, which are often studied in the subfield of planning (cs.PL). The development of CASP systems also involves software engineering (cs.SE) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
