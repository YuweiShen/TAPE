However, since the focus is on wireless communication and network performance, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category. The other sub-categories are also relevant due to the use of stochastic geometry, outage probability, and SI cancellation, which are common topics in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
