The paper proposes heuristic algorithms for multi-query optimization, which involves exploring a search space of possible query plans, making it relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of cost-based heuristics, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the design of algorithms that can be easily added to existing optimizers, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
