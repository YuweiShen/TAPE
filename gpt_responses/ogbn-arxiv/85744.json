It also discusses the problem of default entailment, which is related to logic and reasoning (cs.LO). The paper uses a revision process proposed by Nayak, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the subfield of cryptography (cs.CR) as it discusses the process of iterated revision by sets of sentences.
