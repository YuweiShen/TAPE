The codes are constructed using polynomials, which is a common technique in coding theory and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the algebraic structures of the codes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The probabilistic method used to analyze the codes is a common technique in randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the asymptotic performance of the codes, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
