The problem involves a multinomial logit choice model and the objective is to learn the model parameters while maximizing cumulative revenues. This problem is closely related to topics in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), game theory (cs.GT), and economics (cs.EC).
