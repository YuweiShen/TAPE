The paper also considers the performance-limiting effects and proposes mechanisms to mitigate them, which falls under the category of systems and control (SY). Additionally, the paper deals with the use of nanotransmitters and nanoreceivers, which are related to the field of multimedia (MM). Finally, the paper proposes the optimization of the number of molecules released and the detection threshold, which falls under the category of computer engineering (CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
