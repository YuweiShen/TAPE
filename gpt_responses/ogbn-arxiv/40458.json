This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the development of multimedia era and the generation of multi-view data in various fields. This suggests that the paper may be related to computer vision and pattern recognition. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed algorithm uses an auto-weighted technique to treat multiple views discriminatively according to their contributions. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multi-view data and proposes a method to obtain low-dimensional representations. This falls under the domain of multimedia. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions the need to carefully excavate useful information from multi-view data. This suggests that the paper may be related to information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
