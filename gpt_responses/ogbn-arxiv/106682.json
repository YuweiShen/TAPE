The use of binary inputs and symmetric outputs is a common assumption in information theory, and hence the paper is likely to be categorized under network information theory (cs.NI). The study of partial order induced by the more capable ordering of broadcast channels is a topic in social choice theory, which is a subfield of computer science (cs.SI). The paper also discusses dominance of receivers, which is a topic in game theory and decision science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses some statistical techniques to isolate classes of symmetric channels, which could be categorized under machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
