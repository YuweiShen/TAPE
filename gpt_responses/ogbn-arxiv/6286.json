Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.DL (Machine Learning) and cs.LG (Learning) likely sub-categories. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques to improve OCR accuracy, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category.
