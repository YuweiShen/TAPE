This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science subfields, including information theory (cs.IT), neural networks (cs.NE), distributed computing (cs.DC), systems and control (cs.SY), and architecture (cs.AR). However, given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, cs.IT is the most likely primary category, followed by cs.NE and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
