The paper proposes a novel architecture for image restoration using convolutional and de-convolutional layers, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also presents experimental results on image restoration, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of skip connections to improve the training of deep networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
