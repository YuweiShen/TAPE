Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes an extended version of Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) to improve the training process, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of multiple noise realizations per image, which relates to the field of neural networks (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
