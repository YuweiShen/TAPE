The use of nested sequent calculi and the absence of semantic arguments suggest a focus on syntactic methods, which is often associated with proof theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses tense logic, which is relevant to artificial intelligence and natural language processing, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category as well. The use of modal and intuitionistic logics also suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and theoretical computer science (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on proof theory and syntactic methods may also make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
