This falls under the domain of cryptography and security. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the networked control of DGUs in a microgrid, and proposes a distributed monitoring scheme for detecting replay attacks. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed watermarking scheme for secure control of DGUs in a microgrid, which falls under the domain of distributed computing. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a technique for secure control of DGUs in a microgrid, which involves designing a watermarking signal.
