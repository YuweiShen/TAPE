The paper also addresses the issue of dataset bias, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a method for combining scene-centric and object-centric knowledge, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of adapting the feature extractor to each particular scale, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on recognition accuracy, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
