This involves information theory concepts such as compressive sensing and random projections. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a distributed greedy algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for estimating the sparse support iteratively while fusing indices estimated at distributed nodes. This involves signal processing techniques for sparse signal recovery. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with distributed networks and proposes a collaborative scheme for sparsity pattern recovery. This involves networking and internet architecture concepts such as distributed algorithms and fusion. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multiple measurement data and proposes a collaborative scheme for sparsity pattern recovery. This involves multimedia concepts such as data fusion and processing. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a distributed algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for sparsity pattern recovery. This involves data structures and algorithms for efficient computation and fusion of indices estimated at distributed nodes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
