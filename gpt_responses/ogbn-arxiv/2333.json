This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of an encoder-decoder network and the mention of high computational complexity suggest that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
