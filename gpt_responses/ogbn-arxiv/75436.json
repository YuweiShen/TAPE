The proposed approach involves data augmentation, which is a common technique in machine learning and deep learning, making cs.LG and cs.AI also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of robotic vision, which falls under cs.RO. Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of training deep neural networks, which is a topic in cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
