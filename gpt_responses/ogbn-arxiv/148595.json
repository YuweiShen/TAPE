This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI), as the proposed architecture aims to improve the spectral efficiency of wireless systems. The paper also involves the analysis of an algorithm for designing the RF combining, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of large antenna arrays, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
