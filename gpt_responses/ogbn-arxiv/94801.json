The paper focuses on the spatial multiplexing mode of operation, which is a key technique in massive MIMO and mmWave communication systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. The paper also deals with communication systems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also deals with the detection of received streams, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also deals with the usage scenarios of massive MIMO and mmWave communication systems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
