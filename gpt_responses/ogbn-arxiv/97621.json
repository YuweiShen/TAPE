The paper also introduces a new environment (Continual Ant Maze) and a new metric (Normalized Shorten Distance), which are related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes a framework that involves unsupervised learning (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.CV, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
