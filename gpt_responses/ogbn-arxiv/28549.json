The proposed approach is highly efficient and learns highly discriminative feature representation by effectively fusing shape and texture information at data level. The experiments conducted on facial action unit detection and expression classification demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with learning feature representations from 3D data using convolutional neural networks, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper proposes a novel scheme for fusing texture and geometric data to learn multi-modal mesh surface representations, which is relevant to the graphics community. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an approach to learn feature representations from 3D data using transfer learning and convolutional neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with learning feature representations from multi-modal data (texture and geometric), which is relevant to the multimedia community. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to learn generic multi-modal mesh surface representations, which is relevant to the artificial intelligence community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
