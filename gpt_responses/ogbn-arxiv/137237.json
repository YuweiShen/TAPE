This is because the paper deals with cross-lingual question re-ranking in community forums, which involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as machine translation, bilingual dictionaries, and cross-language word embeddings. Therefore, \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to find relevant questions, which makes \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses kernel-based and neural network approaches, which fall under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with Arabic-English language pair, which is a specific area of interest in \"cs.CY\" (Computers and Society) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
