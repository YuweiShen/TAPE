These applications are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also presents simulation results, which suggest that numerical analysis (cs.NA) could be another relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new criterion for signal/noise subspace identification, which could be of interest to researchers in statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
