The paper also proposes an approach that employs formal abstractions for specifying failure recovery and adaptation strategies, which falls under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of formal abstractions also suggests a focus on Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also mentions the need for monitoring and testing, which are relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of fault tolerance, which is a topic studied in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
