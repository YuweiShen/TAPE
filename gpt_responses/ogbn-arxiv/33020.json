The paper also explicitly models uncertainties, which suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it mentions the difficulties of a human expert to label objects, which could be related to natural language processing tasks such as text classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
