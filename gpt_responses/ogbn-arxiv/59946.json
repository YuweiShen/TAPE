It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a new feedforward CNN model that improves the robustness of CNNs. Additionally, it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with improving the performance of deep learning models. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of CNNs to adversarial noise, which could make it relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new noise model that simplifies computations and makes the method scalable, which could make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
