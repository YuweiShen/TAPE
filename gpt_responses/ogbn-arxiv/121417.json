The paper also mentions iterative decoding thresholds, which are related to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the asymptotic behavior of the codes, which could be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
