The use of linear codes and coding theory techniques suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The focus on machine learning and data analytics algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories.
