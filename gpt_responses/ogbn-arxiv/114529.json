The paper also mentions the use of SHAP, a game theory-based framework, which is commonly used in the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses real-world data and visually depicts features, which suggests the use of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the challenge of manual validation of results, which is a common issue in the subfield of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of outlier detection algorithms, which is a topic commonly studied in the subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
