It discusses the use of an information-theoretic cost function to promote risk-averse or risk-favoring behaviors in agents. This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between expected return and policy complexity, which could be considered a game theory (cs.GT) concept. The use of a single hyperparameter to control policy complexity could be seen as a control systems (cs.SY) approach. Finally, the evaluation of the reinforcement-learning search mechanism could be considered a robotics (cs.RO) application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
