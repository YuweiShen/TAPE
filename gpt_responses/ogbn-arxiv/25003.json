Additionally, the paper also discusses the limitations of existing defenses that leverage differential privacy, which is a common technique used in cryptography and security. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, specifically binary classification and adversarial examples, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision (cs.CV), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI).
