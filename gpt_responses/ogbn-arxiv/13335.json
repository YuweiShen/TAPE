The use of the normal approximation and third-order term suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The mention of dispersion and reverse dispersion is a common topic in the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of capacity and error probability is also relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
