The method is based on the Kalman filter, which is commonly used in control theory and robotics (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of multiple classifiers and the aggregation of their outputs, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper describes experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which is a common practice in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
