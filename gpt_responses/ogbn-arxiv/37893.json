This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as object recognition and feature extraction, which are covered under cs.CV. The use of unsupervised learning techniques for feature extraction and classification falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI and cs.LG. The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) techniques such as clustering and partial classification. Finally, the use of self-collected underwater fish images and the focus on image quality and class imbalance suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of cs.MM, which deals with multimedia and image processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
