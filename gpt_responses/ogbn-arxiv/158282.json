The paper proposes a framework that uses active learning, preference learning, and reinforcement learning, which are all subfields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with summarizing multiple documents. The use of neural networks in the proposed framework falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it studies the interaction between users and the summarization system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
