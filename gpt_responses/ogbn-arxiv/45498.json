The proposed framework is applied to PCA, which is a common machine learning technique. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the use of L1-norm function for handling data with corruptions, large errors or outliers, which is a common problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. The proposed outlier regularization framework is applied to PCA, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n3. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper discusses the robustness of L1-norm function, which is a statistical method for handling data with corruptions, large errors or outliers. The proposed outlier regularization framework is a statistical method for analyzing the robustness of L1-norm function. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a new outlier regularization framework that has an equivalent continuous representation closely related to L1 function. This provides a new way to understand and analyze the robustness of L1 function, which is a numerical analysis problem. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new outlier regularized PCA (ORPCA) model that can be computed"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
