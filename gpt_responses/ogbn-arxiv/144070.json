It may also belong to the embedded systems (cs.ET) sub-category as it discusses the implementation of neural network processing directly onto the focal plane of a sensor. Additionally, it could be categorized under augmented reality (cs.AR) as it mentions a simple tracking task. The paper also involves neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for training and inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
