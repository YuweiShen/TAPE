The problem of fair clustering also involves optimization and decision-making, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents empirical evaluation of the algorithm, which suggests a focus on data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
