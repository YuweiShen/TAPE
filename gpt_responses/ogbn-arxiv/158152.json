The paper applies Bayesian deep learning framework to quantify model uncertainty and principled confidence. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper focuses on safety and security critical applications, it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
