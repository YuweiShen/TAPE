Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel method to integrate source-side syntax implicitly, which involves the use of intermediate hidden representations of a well-trained end-to-end dependency parser. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on two benchmark datasets, which involves training and testing NMT models. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
