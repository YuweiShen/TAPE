These problems involve maximizing a fixed-rank positive semidefinite quadratic form over the MPSK alphabet, which is a topic that falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new technique for solving this problem by partitioning the continuous space of solutions into a polynomial-size set of regions, which involves computational geometry and algorithms (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The algorithm proposed in the paper is fully parallelizable and memory efficient, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
