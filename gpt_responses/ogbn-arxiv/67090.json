The proposed approach uses deep reinforcement learning, which involves training a neural network to make decisions based on rewards and punishments, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the dynamic nature of phishing websites, which requires the model to adapt to changes, making it relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential fraud and monetary loss resulting from phishing attacks, making it relevant to cybercrime (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
