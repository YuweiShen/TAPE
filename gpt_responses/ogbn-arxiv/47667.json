The paper also discusses the evaluation of these representations, which is a common topic in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of weakly-supervised pattern-based bootstrapping and self-training linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) also suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's emphasis on non-standard words and the informal domain suggests a focus on natural language generation and understanding (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
