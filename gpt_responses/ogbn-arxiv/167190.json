The use of deep neural networks is also a strong indicator of the paper belonging to these categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of Bayesian classifiers, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The dataset used for validation is related to multimedia (cs.MM), and the problem of recognizing emotions in images is also relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
