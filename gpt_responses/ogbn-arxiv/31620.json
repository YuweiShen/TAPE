The use of structured test distributions on directed graphs suggests a connection to graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS). The dynamic programming formulation used to compute the upper bounds is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The study of the dicode erasure channel and the improvement obtained by using graph-based test distributions suggests a connection to signal processing and communication (cs.SI). Finally, the alternative converse for the Previous Output is STate (POST) channel may be related to coding theory and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
