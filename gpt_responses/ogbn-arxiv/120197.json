The paper discusses technical challenges related to uncertainty in the environment and proposes a white-box approach to address them. Given the focus on autonomous vehicles and the technical challenges related to perception, planning, and control, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for perception and intention recognition, which makes Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses control policies and safety assurance, which makes Systems and Control (cs.SY) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a white-box approach, which involves explicitly reasoning about uncertainty, making Machine Learning (cs.LG) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
