It also involves computational aspects of the outer bound, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the absence of private information, which could relate to security and privacy (cs.SI) or network security (cs.NI). Finally, the paper may involve multimedia communication (cs.MM) as it deals with broadcasting information to multiple receivers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
