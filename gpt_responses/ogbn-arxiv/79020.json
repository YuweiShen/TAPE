It also involves the use of linear classifiers and minimum residual errors, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses a dataset and features commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper's focus on tracking and optimization suggests it may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
