The use of Sum-of-Squares SDP relaxation techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the analysis of random graphs and probability theory suggests that the paper may also be relevant to statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
