This involves learning from training data and making predictions at test time, which are key components of machine learning. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on detecting anomalies in access data of users to databases, which is a security concern. The proposed approach aims to identify unexpected behavior patterns that may indicate malicious activity. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with access data of users to databases and proposes a method for detecting anomalies in this data. This involves learning a model from the data and using it to make predictions about future access patterns. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for detecting anomalies in temporal data using a hybrid approach that involves learning a model from training data and making predictions at test time. This is a common approach in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a method for detecting anomalies in access data of users to databases using a low-rank stationary model and regression model. This involves designing algorithms for learning from data and making predictions at test time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
