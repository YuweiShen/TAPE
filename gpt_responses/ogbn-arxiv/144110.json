This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT) as well as machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of performance guarantees and fast algorithms. Additionally, the paper mentions the application of the framework to large-scale magnetic resonance (MR) recovery problems, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
