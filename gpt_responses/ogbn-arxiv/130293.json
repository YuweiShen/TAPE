The focus on graph searches and end-vertices suggests a strong connection to graph theory and algorithms, which makes cs.GT and cs.DS the most likely categories. The mention of weakly chordal graphs and split/unit interval graphs also points towards cs.CG and cs.DM. Finally, the use of complexity theory and NP-completeness suggests a possible connection to cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
