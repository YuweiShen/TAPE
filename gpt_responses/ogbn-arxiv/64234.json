The paper also focuses on semantic security, which is a concept in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of superposition coding and soft-covering lemma suggests that the paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper may have applications in multimedia security (cs.MM) due to its focus on secure communication of secret messages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
