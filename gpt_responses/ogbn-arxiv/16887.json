This falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also involves the use of information theory (cs.IT) and cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) in the context of IoT. The experimental demonstration of the scheme involves statistical analysis and verification, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the security of artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT, which could also place it under the category of AI (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
