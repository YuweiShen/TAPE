This topic falls under the intersection of several CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper's focus on analyzing achievable rates of analog and hybrid detection under the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel model suggests that it is most likely to belong to cs.IT and cs.COMM. However, the paper's consideration of various engineering assumptions and performance comparisons of different schemes also make cs.SI, cs.NI, and cs.SY possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
