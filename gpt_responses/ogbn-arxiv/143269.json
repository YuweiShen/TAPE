Specifically, it focuses on the autocorrelation and 2-adic complexity of these sequences. These topics are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), cryptography (cs.CR), coding theory (cs.CC), discrete structures (cs.DS), and signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
