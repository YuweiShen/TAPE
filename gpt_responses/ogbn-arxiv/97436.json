The focus on restricted mobility processes and spatial heterogeneity suggests a potential fit with the machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA) community, as well as the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) community. Finally, the proposed scheduling and routing schemes may involve control and optimization techniques, which could be of interest to the systems and control (cs.SY) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
