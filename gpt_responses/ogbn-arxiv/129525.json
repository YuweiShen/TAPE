It also involves sequential modeling and memory accessing mechanisms, which are relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a new architecture to improve OCR, which is a classic problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses neural networks to solve the OCR problem, which falls under the subfield of deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
