The proposed approach involves joint encoding of appearance and motion features, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of optical flow, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper proposes a self-supervised block, which is a technique that is often used in robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
