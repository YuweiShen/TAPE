The techniques used in the paper involve maintaining relaxed complementary slackness and approximation-preserving reductions, which are common tools in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
