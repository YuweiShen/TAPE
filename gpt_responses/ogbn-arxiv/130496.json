The paper presents a new symbolic planning algorithm that has explicit performance guarantees for relational MDPs with exogenous events. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also introduces novel evaluation and reduction techniques for generalized first-order decision diagrams, which are a knowledge representation for real-valued functions over relational world states. This suggests that the paper may also be categorized under cs.DM (Data Management) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper's focus on planning algorithms suggests that it may also be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
