Given that the paper proposes a novel Temporal-Difference formulation and compares its performance with other off-policy multi-step approaches, it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves deep Q-learning, which is a popular technique in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions simulated robot tasks, which suggests that it may fall under the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) since robot control often involves processing visual information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
