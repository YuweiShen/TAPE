It also involves combinatorial aspects, such as counting and maximizing/minimizing certain types of polygons, which are typical of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.DM, cs.CC). The use of lower bounds and structural results suggests a connection to algorithmic game theory (cs.GT), while the study of empty polygons (k-holes) is related to computational topology (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
