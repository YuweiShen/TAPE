The paper also discusses regret bounds and risk bounds, which are common concepts in statistical learning theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also touches on information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY) in the context of hierarchical priors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
