The proposed low-complexity precoding algorithms involve QR decompositions and lattice reductions, which are commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions achieving maximum diversity order, which is a concept in wireless communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
