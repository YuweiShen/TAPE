The use of GPU- and multi-core-based clusters suggests a focus on parallel computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of these methods to cryptanalysis, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
