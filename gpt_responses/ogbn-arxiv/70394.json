The proposed algorithm involves solving a regression problem and has strong guarantees even when the target matrix is not low rank. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.IT (Information Theory)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
