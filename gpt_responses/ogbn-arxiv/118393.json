This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of trainable soft region proposals, indicating a possible connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a method that is free from bounding box annotations, which suggests a possible connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
