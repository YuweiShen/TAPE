The use of repertory grid interviews suggests a focus on qualitative research methods, which could fall under categories such as digital libraries (cs.DL) or computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the study's focus on mathematical search interfaces could also be relevant to cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
