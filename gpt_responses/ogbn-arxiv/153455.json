It also involves the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and variance reduction techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as federated learning is a popular technique in AI research. The paper may also be relevant to the distributed computing (cs.DC) sub-category as it involves communication between multiple devices. The systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses communication complexity guarantees. Finally, the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category may be relevant as federated learning is often used in image and video analysis tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
