Therefore, cs.AI and cs.RO are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes an algorithm for synthesizing sub-optimal controllers, which involves optimization and relaxations, indicating a possible connection to cs.SY and cs.PL. Finally, the paper uses linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae to specify high-level requirements, which suggests a possible connection to cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
