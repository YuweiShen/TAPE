The paper focuses on applications such as symmetry detection, map refinement across complete shapes, non-rigid partial shape matching, and function transfer, which are all related to computer graphics and geometry processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.GR (Computer Graphics), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Additionally, the paper mentions the computational speed of the proposed method, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
