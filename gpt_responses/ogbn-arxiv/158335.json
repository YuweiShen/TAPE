The paper proposes a new algorithm that combines recent improvements in off-policy data reuse and exploration in parameter space with deterministic behavioral policies. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
