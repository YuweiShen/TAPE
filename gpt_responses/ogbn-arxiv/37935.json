The use of feedback in communication systems also falls under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The study of delay and its impact on communication systems is relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new upper bound, which could be considered a machine learning (cs.LG) technique. Finally, the paper discusses the possibility of beating the sphere-packing bound, which is a topic in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
