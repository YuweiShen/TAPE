This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper proposes a myopic policy to solve it. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is concerned with opportunistic access in multichannel communications, which is a key problem in networking and internet architecture. The paper proposes a policy to optimize channel selection in this context. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a decision-making problem in a stochastic system with noisy observations, which is a classic problem in systems and control. The paper proposes a policy to optimize the system performance. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a multi-armed bandit problem, which is a classic problem in multi-agent systems. The paper proposes a policy to optimize the performance of the system. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a myopic policy to solve a decision-making problem in a stochastic system with noisy observations.
