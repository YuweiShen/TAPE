The use of sphere decoding (SD) for soft-input soft-output (SISO) MIMO demapping involves complex algorithms and data structures, which are often implemented using digital signal processing techniques (cs.AR). The design of VLSI architectures for SD also involves considerations of power consumption, area, and timing constraints, which are typical concerns in electronic engineering (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed architecture, which is a topic related to distributed systems and parallel computing (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the performance of the proposed architecture, which is a topic related to control systems and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
