The paper also discusses the recognition of object properties, such as shape and surface material, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the combination of touch sensing with other sensing sources, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
