This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a regularization approach to address the problem, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of optical flow, which is a common technique in Multimedia (cs.MM) and Neural Networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, and cs.AI, followed by cs.MM and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
