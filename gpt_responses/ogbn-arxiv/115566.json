This approach is specifically targeted towards programming language (cs.PL) analysis and software engineering (cs.SE) applications. The paper also mentions the use of memoization, which is a technique commonly used in logic and verification (cs.LO) and formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing automata theoretic models, which is a topic relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
