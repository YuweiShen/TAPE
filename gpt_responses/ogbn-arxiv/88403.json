This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with relay networks, which are a key component of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with information flow over networks, which is a topic of interest in social and information networks.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper mentions that the proposed codes are computationally tractable. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the computational complexity community.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with information flow over networks, which is relevant to multimedia applications such as video streaming and file sharing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
