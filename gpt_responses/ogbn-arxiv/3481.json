Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the coordination of interference among different cells and multicast groups, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of multi-antenna systems and the optimization of group-rates suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
