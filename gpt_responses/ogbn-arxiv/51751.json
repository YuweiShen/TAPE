The paper also heavily relies on deep learning techniques for visual input (cs.CV) and reinforcement learning (cs.LG) for grasping diverse objects. The paper also discusses state representation learning (cs.AI) and its effectiveness in improving RL performance. Finally, the paper deals with the control of robotic systems (cs.SY) for grasping tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
