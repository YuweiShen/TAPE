The paper also discusses the use of lattice-reduction-aided detection (LRAD) which is a common technique used in information theory. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of systolic array architectures which are commonly used in digital signal processing and are closely related to information theory.\n\nThe paper could also belong to the sub-categories of Computer Architecture (cs.AR) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) as it discusses the design of a systolic array architecture for MIMO receivers and the use of modified LLL algorithms for parallel processing.\n\nThe sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY) is also a possibility as the paper discusses the design of a hardware-efficient systolic array architecture for MIMO receivers.\n\nFinally, the sub-category of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET) is a possibility as the paper discusses the use of novel techniques such as systolic array architectures and modified LLL algorithms for MIMO detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
