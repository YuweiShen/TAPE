This falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n\n2. cs.SD (Software Engineering) - The paper introduces a programmable service called 411 for Twitter, which supports user-defined and application-specific commands through tweets. This involves software engineering concepts such as designing and implementing a service.\n\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques to interpret user-defined commands in tweets. This falls under the scope of computation and language.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the impact of social networks and internet messengers on modern digital life.
