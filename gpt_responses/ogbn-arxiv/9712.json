However, the focus on hyperparameter optimization and the use of Kernel Ridge regression make cs.LG (Machine Learning) the most likely category. The use of real traffic measurement data also suggests a potential fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of optimization techniques and the focus on prediction accuracy suggest a potential fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
