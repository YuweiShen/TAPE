The authors also mention chunk-and-pass processing, which is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses information theory, which is a subfield of computer science (cs.IT) that deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information. Finally, the paper touches on memory and processing limitations, which are relevant to systems design (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
