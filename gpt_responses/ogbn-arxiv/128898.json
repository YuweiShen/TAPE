The focus on reducing network complexity for real-time inference on embedded computing platforms suggests a possible fit with the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of spatio-temporal sparsity of pixel changes and optimization of inference procedures may also align with the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of object detection on static camera video surveillance data suggests a possible fit with the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
