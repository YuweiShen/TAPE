It also involves the study of lattice structures and characterizations of support spaces, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). The applications of the sum-rank metric to linear network coding and the discrete memoryless channel suggest that it may also be relevant to networking (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
