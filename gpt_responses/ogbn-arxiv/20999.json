The paper also discusses the performance of these algorithms on various test-beds, which falls under the category of Robotics (RO) and Systems and Control (SY). The paper also presents a novel off-policy DRL algorithm, which is related to the subfield of Neural Networks (NE). Finally, the paper discusses the learning dynamics of the DRL algorithms, which is related to the subfield of Learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
