The study also involves the use of machine learning techniques for automatic disambiguation of adpositions, which could be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for cross-linguistic tasks such as machine translation, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR).
