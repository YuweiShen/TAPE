Additionally, the paper mentions the use of classification algorithms, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the selection of lexical features, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.LG). Furthermore, the paper proposes a phishing detection system, which involves software engineering and system design (cs.SE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of noisy training data, which is a common challenge in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
