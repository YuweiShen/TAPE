The paper also discusses the use of negation as failure and aggregates in heuristic conditions, which are topics related to Logic (cs.LO) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper deals with combinatorial problems, which are often studied in the subfield of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM).
