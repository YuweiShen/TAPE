The paper also focuses on Information-Centric Networks (ICN), which is a sub-field of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper discusses the benefits of a new approach called Modified Index Coding (MIC), which is a technique that can be applied to both wireless and wired networks, and can improve the capacity of the network. This makes the paper relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category, which deals with techniques for processing and transmitting signals. The paper also discusses the use of caching at routers and nodes, which is a topic that falls under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses analytical and simulation methods to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
