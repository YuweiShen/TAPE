The paper discusses the performance of ISRLU compared to other activation functions such as ReLU, ELU, tanh, and sigmoid, and its potential applications in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
