The use of regularized learning algorithms and recency bias suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the individual regret of players, which is a concept in multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the black-box reduction technique mentioned in the abstract suggests a possible connection to control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
