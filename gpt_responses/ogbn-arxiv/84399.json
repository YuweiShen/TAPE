Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a joint infrastructure-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vehicle communication scheme based on network coding, which involves coding and decoding of data packets. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the proposed scheme involves scheduling of transmissions, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
