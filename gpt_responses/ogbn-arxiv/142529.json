The paper also introduces a fault-tolerant mechanism using fuzzy set sample weighting, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses data augmentation and feature extraction, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on challenging datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
