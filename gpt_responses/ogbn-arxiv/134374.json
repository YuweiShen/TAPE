Therefore, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the challenges of function-oriented VR applications, which falls under the scope of cs.GR (Graphics). The use of modern software engineering tools, such as app stores and open source platforms, is also mentioned, which could be classified under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, the paper discusses user feedback and community effort, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
