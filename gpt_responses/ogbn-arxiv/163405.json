Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, which is a popular algorithm in the field of Deep Learning (DL) and specifically in the sub-category of cs.LG. The paper also discusses the use of a deterministic finite state machine (FSM) for adaptive action space restriction, which falls under the sub-category of cs.RO. The paper also mentions the use of a realistic driving environment, which is related to the sub-category of cs.CV. Finally, the paper discusses the use of RL for controlling a complex environment, which is related to the sub-category of cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
