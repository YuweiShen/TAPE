The paper specifically focuses on the challenges of provisioning a distributed mobile edge cloud for 5G networks, which makes cs.NI the most likely category. However, the paper also addresses issues related to datacenter placement, service disruption, and network optimization, which could fall under cs.DC, cs.SY, and cs.AR. Finally, the paper proposes algorithms for provisioning the data plane, which could involve control theory and optimization techniques, making cs.CC a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
