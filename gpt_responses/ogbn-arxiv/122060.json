This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of constrained optimization and real-time implementation, which are relevant to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
