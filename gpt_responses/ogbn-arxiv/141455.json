It specifically focuses on the routing of payments through multiple channels and proposes the use of a channel hub to shorten the routing path. The paper also presents a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain cross-channel transfers through the channel hub. Given the focus on security and network protocols, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
