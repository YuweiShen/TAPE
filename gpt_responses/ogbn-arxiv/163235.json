The construction involves algebraic structures of elliptic curves, which suggests a possible category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the distance and locality of the codes, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR) and distributed systems (cs.DS), respectively. Finally, the paper presents a new construction method, which could be of interest to researchers in coding theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
