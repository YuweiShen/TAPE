The experiments conducted in the paper involve fitting natural images (cs.CV), one-dimensional functions (cs.NE), and the MNIST dataset (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses Fourier analysis to understand the behavior of DNNs, which is a technique that falls under the category of signal processing (cs.IT). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE, cs.AI, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
