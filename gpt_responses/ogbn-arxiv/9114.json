The paper also presents a processing engine for implementing graph algorithms on hybrid platforms, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of GPUs for acceleration is a common topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
