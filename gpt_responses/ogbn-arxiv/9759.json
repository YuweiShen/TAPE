The approach proposed in the paper involves unsupervised iterative clustering-based segmentation, which can also be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The use of statistical analysis and hyper-parameter tuning can be associated with neural networks (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.SD) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
