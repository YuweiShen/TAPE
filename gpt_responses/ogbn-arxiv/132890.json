The paper proposes a new approach to exploration in RL, which does not require explicit exploration but instead relies on a nonlinear Q-function. This approach is evaluated on several standard benchmark tasks, including mountain car, and is shown to perform equally well as, or better than, the most commonly-used $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration. Given the focus on RL and machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
