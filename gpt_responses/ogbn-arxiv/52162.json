The use of linear-time properties and LP methods suggests a connection to logic and formal verification (cs.LO), while the application to probabilistic systems and the use of randomization and memory suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The graph-theoretic methods mentioned in the abstract also suggest a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
