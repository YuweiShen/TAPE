The paper proposes an algorithm to solve this problem, which involves data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the application of hierarchy in directed networks to real-world phenomena, which is a common theme in social and information networks research. The paper also discusses the use of agony as a penalty function, which is a popular approach in social and information networks research. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an algorithm to discover hierarchy in directed networks, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. The paper also discusses the use of penalty functions, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of hierarchy in directed networks to model and control real-world phenomena, which is a common theme in systems and control research. The paper also discusses the use of agony as a penalty function, which is a popular approach in systems and control research. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes an algorithm to discover hierarchy in directed networks, which can be seen as a neural or evolutionary computing problem.
