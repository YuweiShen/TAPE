The proposed approach is based on stability, which is a concept often used in optimization and control theory (cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on different architectures and datasets, which could also fit in the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing category (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
