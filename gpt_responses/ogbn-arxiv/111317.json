The maps are generated using a generative aircraft flow model based on archived Enhanced Traffic Management System data. This involves clustering algorithms and probability density functions, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of these maps for strategic planning, which involves optimization and decision-making, falling under the sub-category of computational optimization and control (cs.SI). The use of data-driven modeling and analysis techniques also suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of data-centric computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper involves the use of probability and statistical analysis, which could fall under the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
