This falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the resulting prover on various datasets, which could be considered under programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the implementation of the MESON proof reconstruction mechanism, which could be considered under software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the prover as a general purpose TPTP prover, which could be considered under machine learning (cs.LG) as TPTP is a widely used dataset in automated theorem proving research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
