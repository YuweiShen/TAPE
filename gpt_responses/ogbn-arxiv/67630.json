The paper also discusses the application of this method in healthcare (cs.HC) and education (cs.CE) domains, which suggests that it may be relevant to those sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper proposes a hybrid human-AI system, which could be considered under the sub-category of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
