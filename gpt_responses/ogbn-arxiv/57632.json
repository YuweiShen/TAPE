The paper also discusses the cognitive resources and attention of the human supervisor, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of reachability theory to construct safe sets for the robots falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a method that uses machine learning to decrease false positives, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
