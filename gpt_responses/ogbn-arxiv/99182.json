This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also proposes a method for learning feature subspaces, which involves training a model to recognize objects and attributes (cs.AI) and potentially involves natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on challenging datasets, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
