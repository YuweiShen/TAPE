The paper also discusses the use of nonlocal bases and regularization, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the BM3D algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art image denoising algorithm (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the energy concentration property of convolution framelet coefficients, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
