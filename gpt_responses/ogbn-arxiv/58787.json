The paper also discusses different analog receiver architectures for MIMO channels, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP). The use of analog combiners and sign quantizers for analog/digital conversion suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper's focus on optimizing capacity suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
