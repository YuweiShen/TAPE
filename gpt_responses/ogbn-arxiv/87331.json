This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also addresses the challenge of providing feedback to users when a specification fails to yield a corresponding controller, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents techniques for refining feedback and extracting minimal explanations, which suggests that it may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
