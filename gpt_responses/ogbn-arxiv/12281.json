The proposed technique involves integrating the motion of dynamic objects into the SLAM estimation problem, which requires computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques to process the sensor data and estimate the environment structure. The paper also introduces a novel representation of the pose change of rigid bodies in motion, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.AI). Finally, the proposed technique can be applied to various types of robotic systems, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, which involves control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
