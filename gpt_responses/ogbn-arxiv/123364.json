The use of state estimation and event-triggering protocols also indicates that it could belong to the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The application of the approach to the control of a vehicle platoon suggests that it could also be classified under robotics (cs.RO) or distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the use of a common bus network for data exchange implies that it could belong to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
