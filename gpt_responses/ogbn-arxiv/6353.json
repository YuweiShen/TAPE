Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel module for learning a more discriminative representation, which involves machine learning (ML) techniques, making cs.LG a likely sub-category as well. The paper also involves image retrieval (IR) techniques for identifying scripts in images, making cs.IR a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with multi-modal data (text and images), making cs.MM a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
