This involves processing images through a probe network and computing an embedding based on estimates of the Fisher information matrix associated with the probe network parameters. The paper also demonstrates the practical value of this framework for the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor for a new task. Given this focus on visual classification tasks and meta-learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computation and language (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
