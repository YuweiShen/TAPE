Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses technical challenges related to obtaining a fast hardware-agnostic implementation, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
