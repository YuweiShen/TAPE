The use of multi-level spatially pooled features (MLSP) suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning (cs.LG) approaches and investigates the performance of different methods under different levels of label noise, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new dataset for video quality assessment, which may also place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
