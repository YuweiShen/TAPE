The paper also involves training and testing of the segmentation and fusion modules, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of novel strategies for making full use of limited training data suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The evaluation of the framework on challenging abdominal organs suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep neural networks for segmentation suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
