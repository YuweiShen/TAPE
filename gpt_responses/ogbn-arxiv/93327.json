This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also mentions leveraging popular CNNs to learn cloth deformations in image space, which suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM), Computer Graphics (cs.CG), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
