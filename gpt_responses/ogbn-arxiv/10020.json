The use of deep generative models and adversarial learning also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of the model to texture and shape interpolation and appearance transfer suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
