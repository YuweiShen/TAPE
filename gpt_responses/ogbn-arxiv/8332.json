This method is applied to deep reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the performance of the method on various games, which involves learning effective strategies and conventions in complex, partially observable settings, indicating that it falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with multi-agent systems, which is a subfield of computer science (cs.MA). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks for learning, which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the method in complex, partially observable settings, which is a subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
