The focus is on h-refinement with a fixed polynomial order. The paper presents numerical experiments verifying the correctness of the algorithms and performs a parallel scaling study to show that the algorithm can adapt meshes containing billions of elements and run efficiently on a large number of parallel tasks. These aspects suggest that the paper belongs to the cs.NA sub-category.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a general algorithm for adaptive mesh refinement of unstructured meshes in high-order finite element codes. The paper presents a flexible data structure for meshes with hanging nodes and a general procedure to construct the conforming interpolation operator, both in serial and in parallel.
