The fact that all local minima are global is a result that is relevant to optimization, which is a key aspect of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also deals with neural networks with arbitrary loss, which suggests that it could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nAdditionally, the paper could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as deep neural networks are commonly used in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
