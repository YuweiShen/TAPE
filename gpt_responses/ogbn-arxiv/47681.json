However, the paper also highlights the safety-critical nature of these systems, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and formal methods (cs.LO). Additionally, the use of formal methods for verification implies a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
