The paper proposes a new algorithm that runs in $O(n + \\rho^2)$ time and can be extended to return the position of a match or use only $O(n)$ bits of space. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), or computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
