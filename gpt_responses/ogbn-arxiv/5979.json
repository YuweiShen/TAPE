This approach can be combined with dynamic programming methods for policy optimization and value estimation. The paper provides guarantees for the proposed applications in MDPs and presents experiments on classical control and navigation problems. The paper's focus on nonparametric methods, learning, and optimization suggests that it is most likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper's application to control and navigation problems suggests that it may also belong to the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper's use of image data in the navigation problem suggests that it may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
