The proposed method involves deep feature compression using auto-encoders, which is a common technique in machine learning and deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves pre-training and fine-tuning of the auto-encoders, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves experiments with video data, suggesting that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
