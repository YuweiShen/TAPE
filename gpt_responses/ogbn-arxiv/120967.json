This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the challenges of training deep models on medical images, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to dividing hierarchical features into different branches, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for image super resolution is a common application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
