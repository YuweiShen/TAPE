The paper also utilizes deep neural networks for grasp detection, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper introduces a novel loss function and scorer, which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed model using a simulated grasp trial criterion, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
