The paper discusses the use of novelty search and quality diversity algorithms to promote directed exploration in ES. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and the experiments involve simulated robots, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
