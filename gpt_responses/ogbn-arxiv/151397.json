This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a hierarchical approach to organizing the classes based on their visual similarities, which involves clustering (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with remote sensing data, which falls under the domain of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
