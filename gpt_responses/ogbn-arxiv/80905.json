Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another likely sub-category. The use of tables as a knowledge source implies cs.DB (Databases) as a possible sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which suggests cs.IR as another possible sub-category. Finally, the use of logical forms and typing constraints suggests cs.LG (Learning) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
