The paper proposes a novel Bayesian Non-parametric (BNP) prior which models Temporal Coherence. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with learning and inference problems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper proposes a probabilistic model, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper deals with video analytics, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with clustering, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
