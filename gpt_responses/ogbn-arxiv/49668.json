Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a new approach to self-attention that can generalize to arbitrary graph-labeled inputs, which suggests that it could be relevant to other areas of machine learning such as computer vision (cs.CV), natural language generation (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
