The paper also discusses training efficiency and regularization theory, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses Residual Networks (ResNet), which is a type of neural network architecture that falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses small datasets and efficient network training, which are topics related to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
