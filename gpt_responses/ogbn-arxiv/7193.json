This suggests that the paper belongs to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS, cs.AL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the algorithm in terms of duplicated elements, which could fall under the sub-categories of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) or Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions that the algorithm is in-place, which could be relevant to Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
