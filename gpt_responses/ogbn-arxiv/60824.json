Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves training text-to-text rewriting models, which falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of synthetic data and testing different types of noise suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with summarizing large amounts of text. Finally, the use of denoising techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
