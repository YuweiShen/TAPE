This falls under the scope of several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Given the focus on word embeddings and similarity metrics, cs.CL and cs.LG are the most likely categories. However, the paper also discusses the performance of their method on biomedical benchmarks, which suggests a potential fit with cs.IR and cs.AI. Finally, the use of unsupervised methods and the focus on scalability and transparency could also be relevant to cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
