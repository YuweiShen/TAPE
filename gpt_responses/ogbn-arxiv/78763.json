The algorithm also involves protecting previously learnt representations from catastrophic forgetting, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the ability to perform cross-domain inference, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
