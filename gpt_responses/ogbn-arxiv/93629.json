The use of structured support vector machine (SSVM) also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves the analysis of running time, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques could also suggest that it belongs to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
