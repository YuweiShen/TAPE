Therefore, cs.IR and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL), making cs.CL and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper uses event embedding vectors, which can be seen as a form of feature engineering, and thus, cs.CV (computer vision) could also be a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
