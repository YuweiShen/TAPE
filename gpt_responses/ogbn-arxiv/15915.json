Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the tool uses semantic information from an entity recognition component, which suggests that it may also be relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The deterministic, rule-based approach used in the tool may also be relevant to Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the tool may be useful for Information Retrieval (cs.IR) tasks that involve analyzing and understanding natural language text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
