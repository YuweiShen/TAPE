The use of recurrent neural networks for prediction suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method to administrative processes suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the use of logs to quantify supply and demand suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
