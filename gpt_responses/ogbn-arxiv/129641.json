Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves physical layer measurements and wireless communication, which suggests the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of WiFi and ZigBee nodes for implementation indicates the category cs.MM (Multimedia) may also be relevant. Finally, the paper involves detecting people's movements, which could fall under the category cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
