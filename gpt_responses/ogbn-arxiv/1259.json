Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper analyzes the optimization trajectories of the network, which suggests a potential connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the frequency components of the image and early stopping, which could relate to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
