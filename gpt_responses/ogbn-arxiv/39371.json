Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of an abstraction hierarchy in planning, which is a topic in planning and scheduling (cs.PL). The use of Dempster-Shafer interval for characterizing uncertain information is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the construction of a super-plan, which involves decision-making and optimization, which are topics in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
