The paper also discusses the reduction of broadcast cost and expected time cost, which can be related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the evaluation and comparison of different routing protocols, which can be related to computer networks and communications (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the enhancement of Expanding Ring Search algorithm, which can be related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
