The paper also involves the study of Boolean functions, which is a topic in logic and set theory (cs.LO). The use of decision diagrams, which are a type of data structure, suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper involves the comparison of different representation types, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and the analysis of the relative succinctness of these representations, which could be relevant to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
