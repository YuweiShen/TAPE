This involves image classification, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of CNNs also suggests that the paper may fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves training and evaluating CNNs, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Geographic information is utilized, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the geographic information systems (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves generating building classification maps, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
