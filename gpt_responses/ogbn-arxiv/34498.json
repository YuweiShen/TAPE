The paper specifically focuses on the coexistence constraint, which is a key issue in cognitive radio networks, and proposes a joint design of various components to minimize the sum mean square error of the secondary user system. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
