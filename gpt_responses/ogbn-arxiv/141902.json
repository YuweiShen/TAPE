The paper uses machine learning classification models to identify the diseases that a person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also uses textual analytics models to map measurements to appropriate wearable technologies, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also uses machine learning models for classification, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper deals with the development of a recommendation engine, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the mapping of measurements to wearables, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
