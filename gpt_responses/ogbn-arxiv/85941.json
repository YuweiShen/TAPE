This involves understanding verbal and non-verbal behaviours of students and teachers during instruction, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of AI methods for anonymisation involves natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques, which are subfields of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV), respectively. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms for automated ratings of behaviours, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the sensitivity of student data and the need for data protection and privacy, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
