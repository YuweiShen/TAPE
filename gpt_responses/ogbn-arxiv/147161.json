This involves topics such as scheduling, resource allocation, monitoring, coordination, and state management. These topics are closely related to distributed systems (cs.DC), cloud computing (cs.CE), software engineering (cs.SE), and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DC, cs.CE, cs.SE, cs.DS, and cs.Distributed Systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
