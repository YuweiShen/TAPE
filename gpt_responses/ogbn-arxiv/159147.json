Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the limitations of the object-oriented design principle, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The discussion of operating system optimizations falls under cs.OS (Operating Systems). The paper also mentions the porting of controllers to a network-efficient architecture, which falls under cs.AR (Architecture). Finally, the paper discusses the per-packet overhead, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
