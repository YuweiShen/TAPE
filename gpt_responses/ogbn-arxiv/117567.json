This involves the use of a neural network to identify a suspicious device and enforce it to be inactive in every iteration of the AMP algorithm. The paper thus involves topics related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
