This is a classic topic in game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to the classical secretary problem, which involves designing an agent that evaluates the secretary performance and another agent that makes the hiring decision. This can be seen as an AI problem of designing intelligent agents for decision-making. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper studies the optimization problem of the sender and proposes incentive-compatible mechanisms to recover a natural utility benchmark. This involves learning from data and designing algorithms for optimization. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the information transmission (signaling) challenge for the sender when the interests of the two agents are not fully aligned. This involves studying the information-theoretic limits of communication and coding. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper revisits the basic variant of the classical secretary problem and proposes a new approach to separate evaluation and decision making. This involves designing efficient algorithms and data structures for solving the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
