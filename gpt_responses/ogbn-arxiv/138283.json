The focus on CAVs and their control systems suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the discussion of human factors and user acceptance suggests that the paper may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The consideration of safety and efficiency in the CAV system design suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the discussion of protocol stacks and reliable information transmission suggests that the paper may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
