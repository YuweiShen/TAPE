The proposed method involves using random walk-based regularization to improve the quality of the learned embeddings, which is a technique commonly used in network analysis and graph mining (cs.SI, cs.DS). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on node clustering and link prediction tasks, which are common tasks in natural language processing and information retrieval (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
