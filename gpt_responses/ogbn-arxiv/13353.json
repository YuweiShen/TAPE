The concept of shift-invariant spaces is also a key component of the paper, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category of shift-invariant systems (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions convolution and semi-discrete convolution operators, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
