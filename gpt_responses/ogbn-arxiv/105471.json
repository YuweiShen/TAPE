Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes learning filters in an end-to-end manner, which suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of deep architecture for action recognition also suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also experiments with the added value of the proposed method, which suggests a neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of complex steerable filters suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
