The paper also focuses on image compression performance, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The use of FPGA technology and hardware architectures indicates a possible fit with multimedia (cs.MM) and computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories. Finally, the proposed metric for combining performance and computational complexity measures suggests a potential connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
