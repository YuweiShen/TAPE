Additionally, the paper introduces a framework with self-supervised auxiliary reasoning tasks, which involves reasoning and decision-making, making it likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, since the task involves navigation, it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
