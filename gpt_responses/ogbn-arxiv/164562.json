The paper proposes novel combinatorial approaches to coded caching design in D2D networks, which involves coding theory and graph theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with network protocols and algorithms for D2D networks, which falls under the sub-category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization and performance analysis, which falls under the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also involves combinatorial algorithms and graph theory, which falls under the sub-categories cs.DC (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
