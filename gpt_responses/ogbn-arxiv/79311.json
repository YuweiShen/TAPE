The paper also discusses the use of supervised models and regularization techniques, which are common topics in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes control tasks to complement linguistic tasks, which is a topic that falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of ELMo representations and MLPs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses part-of-speech tagging and dependency edge prediction, which are tasks that are commonly studied in the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
