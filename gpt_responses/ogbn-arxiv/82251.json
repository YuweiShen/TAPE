The use of feedback rates and transmission schemes also suggests a possible categorization under networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also proposes a numerical method for finding the optimal feedback rate sharing strategy, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM) depending on the specific application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
