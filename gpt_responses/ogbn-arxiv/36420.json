The method involves multi-task learning and feature extraction, which are also common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of residual learning and multi-layer perceptron classifiers suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper involves a dispatch strategy that utilizes domain knowledge, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
