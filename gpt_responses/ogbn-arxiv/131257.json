This falls under the domain of information theory, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed receiver architecture is designed for wireless networks, where multiple users can simultaneously transmit and receive signals. This involves issues related to network protocols, resource allocation, and interference management, which are relevant to the networking and internet architecture sub-category. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates an optimization problem for a multiuser MISO system, which involves balancing the trade-off between information transmission and energy harvesting. This requires designing control systems that can optimize the performance of the network, which falls under the systems and control sub-category. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of wireless signals for both information and energy transfer, which can have applications in multimedia systems such as wireless charging of mobile devices or powering sensors in smart homes. \n\n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The proposed receiver architecture involves using a diplexer to split the wireless signal into baseband and doubling frequency components, which requires designing hardware components that can operate at high frequencies and handle multiple signals simultaneously.
