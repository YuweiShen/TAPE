This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of temporal logic specifications, which is a common tool in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with safety and performance guarantees, which are important aspects of control systems (cs.SY). The paper mentions the use of nonlinear programming, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also addresses scalability issues, which is a common concern in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
