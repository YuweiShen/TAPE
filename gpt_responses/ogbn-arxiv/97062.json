The paper also specifically mentions state space planning, which is a subfield of AI that falls under planning (cs.PL). The study involves empirical analysis of the effects of spurious transitions on heuristic functions, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) as well as machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the study for improving search algorithms, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
