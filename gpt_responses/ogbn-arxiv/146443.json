The paper also discusses the evaluation and training of DANNs, which could be relevant to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the proposed method is tested on image classification tasks, which could be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for the generated models to be used in deployment, which could be relevant to Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
