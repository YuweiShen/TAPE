The use of a cognitive helper and state information also suggests a possible categorization under cs.NI (networking and internet architecture). The study of state interference and cancellation may also fall under cs.SI (signal processing). The use of Gaussian channels and capacity region analysis may suggest a categorization under cs.MM (machine learning) or cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
