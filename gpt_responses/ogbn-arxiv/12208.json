This work involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, which are typically covered in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed NDT model could be applied to various domains, such as computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), which are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the back-propagation process, which is a common technique in neural networks and could be covered in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
