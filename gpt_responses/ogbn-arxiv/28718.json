It involves the study of the variability of the loads of the nodes of the network and the investigation of several policies. The paper uses probabilistic methods and mean-field analysis to analyze the asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary node of the network when the total number of nodes gets large. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.PF (Probability)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
