The proposed method uses deep neural networks to automatically learn features for solving this problem. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Deep Learning (cs.DL), and Databases (cs.DB). However, since the focus is on information retrieval and natural language processing, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
