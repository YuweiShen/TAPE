The paper also proposes a novel unsupervised pose augmentation scheme using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), which involves training a generator network to produce pose-rich samples from original image and skeleton samples. This falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves experiments with image retrieval (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
