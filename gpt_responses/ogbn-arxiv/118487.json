The proposed method involves learning a global ranking, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) or computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
