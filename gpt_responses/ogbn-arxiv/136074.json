The paper also proposes a new method using a rotation ensemble module, which involves training the network with rotated weights, which is a technique related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a real-time robotic grasping task, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
