The paper proposes a novel framework that formulates the problem as a convex optimization problem, enables transductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers a scalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a linear time complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs. The paper also presents experiments with real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DB (Databases), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
