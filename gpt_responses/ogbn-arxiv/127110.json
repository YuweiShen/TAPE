The paper focuses on reducing inefficiencies in the tableau-based reasoning calculi used in state-of-the-art reasoners. This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of ontologies, which is a common topic in databases (cs.DB) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper introduces new rules and techniques for handling specific DL constructs, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
