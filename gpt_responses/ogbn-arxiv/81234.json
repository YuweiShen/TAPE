This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the weight distribution of the codes, which is a combinatorial aspect and falls under the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. The use of Gauss sums suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and the construction of codes with few weights is a computational problem, which falls under the complexity theory (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
