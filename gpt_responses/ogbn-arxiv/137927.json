The proposed method involves estimating the power spectrum and bispectrum of the signal, which are invariant under translations, and using them to infer the signal. This approach involves optimization over a smooth manifold of phases, which is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of semidefinite relaxation and integer programming, which are common optimization techniques in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on the performance of the proposed method, which is a common approach in statistical inference and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
