The paper also proposes a hypothesis on the behavior of such self-supervised learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses neural networks to perform the self-supervised learning, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed techniques on image datasets, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
