The use of auxiliary information also suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) may be relevant. Finally, the paper evaluates the method's performance on real-world data, which could fall under the category of large-scale data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
