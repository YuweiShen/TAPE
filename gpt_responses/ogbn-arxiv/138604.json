This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new benchmarking procedure that relies on semantic similarity measures, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a new dataset and benchmarking procedure also involves multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
