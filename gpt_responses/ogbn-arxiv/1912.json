This involves detecting ventricles and identifying tissue adjacent to them, and then using outlier intensities to identify potential WMI candidates. The method is segmentation-free, unsupervised, and atlas-free, and is designed to be fast. Given these characteristics, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the method involves outlier detection and heuristics, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. The use of normal distribution assumptions and intensity-based analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of magnetic resonance images suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
