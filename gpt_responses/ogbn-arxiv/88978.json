The paper also involves the analysis of upper and lower bounds on the capacity, which is a common approach in signal processing and statistical inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper considers the impact of phase noise on the transmit and receive antennas, which is relevant to the design and optimization of wireless networks (cs.NI). Finally, the paper's results have implications for the performance of MIMO systems, which is a topic in control and systems theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
