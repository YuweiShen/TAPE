The paper specifically focuses on nominal sets over the total order symmetry, which is a well-studied case. The paper presents a new approach to computing with nominal sets that works directly at the level of orbits, which allows for an accurate complexity analysis. The paper also presents an implementation of the approach as a library called ONS, and evaluates it in two applications related to automata theory. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), which deals with mathematical logic and its applications in computer science. Other likely sub-categories include cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
