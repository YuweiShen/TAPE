This falls under the domain of natural language processing and computational linguistics, which is a sub-category of cs.CL.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses harmful speech on social media, specifically Twitter, and proposes a method to classify it based on degree of hateful intent. This falls under the domain of social and information networks, which is a sub-category of cs.SI.\n- cs.SD (Sound): Although the paper does not deal with sound, it does deal with text data which can be considered a form of \"digital sound\". The paper proposes a method to classify harmful speech based on ontological classes and degrees of harmful speech found in the text, which can be considered a form of sound classification. Hence, cs.SD is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with harmful speech on social media and proposes a method to classify it based on degree of hateful intent. This falls under the domain of computers and society, which is a sub-category of cs.CY.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not deal with cryptography, it does deal with security in the context of harmful speech"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
