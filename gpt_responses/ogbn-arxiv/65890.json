The construction of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The protocol's correctness and stability are analyzed under asynchronous and non-FIFO message delivery, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY) and distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
