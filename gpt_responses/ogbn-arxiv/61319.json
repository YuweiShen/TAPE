The use of spectral decomposition methods is a novel approach to solving this problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
