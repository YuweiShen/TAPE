The paper discusses the effect of removing large groups of training points and how influence functions can still accurately predict the effect. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, but the most likely ones are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
