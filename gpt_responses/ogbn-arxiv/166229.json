The use of LTL formulas for specifying the global behavior of the team suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control theory (cs.SY). The development of a computational framework and algorithm for generating robot control and communication strategies indicates a potential connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
