The paper also makes use of category theory and topos theory, which are topics that fall under the sub-categories of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), respectively. The paper also discusses the computation of invariants, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI).
