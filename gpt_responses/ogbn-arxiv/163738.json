The primary focus is on the impact of data transfer overhead and the effectiveness of streaming approaches. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PF (Performance). Additionally, the paper involves the use of parallel computing and optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.AR (Architecture). The paper also involves experimentation and analysis of code, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper proposes a streaming approach, which could fall under cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
