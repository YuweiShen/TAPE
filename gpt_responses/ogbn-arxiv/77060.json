The use of competitive analysis and optimization suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The problem of scheduling jobs with release times and deadlines involves combinatorial optimization, which is a topic in the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. The study of competitive ratios and lower bounds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category.
