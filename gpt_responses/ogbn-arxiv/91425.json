RBM is a popular model in machine learning and is often used in applications such as image recognition and natural language processing. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
