The paper also addresses scalability issues in dealing with large amounts of data, which is a common concern in database systems (cs.DB). The use of natural language processing techniques for processing RDF data is also mentioned, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the need for robustness in reasoning systems, which is a concern in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
