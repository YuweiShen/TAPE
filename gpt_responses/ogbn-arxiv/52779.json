The paper specifically focuses on instance-level normalization, which is commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses gradient back-propagation, which is a common technique in neural networks, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions that it can be applied to natural language processing tasks, indicating that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
