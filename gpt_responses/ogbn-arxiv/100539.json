The proposed method also involves the use of dual-attention mechanism and weighted double margin contrastive loss, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of remote sensing images, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
