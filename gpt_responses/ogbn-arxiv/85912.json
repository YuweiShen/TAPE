This involves the use of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) to control the car's steering actuators. The paper also discusses the use of simulators (cs.SE) to generate test datasets for DNNs. Additionally, the paper focuses on the accuracy of DNN predictions (cs.AI) and the safety implications of testing DNNs in both offline and online modes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
