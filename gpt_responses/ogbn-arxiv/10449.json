It may also belong to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category as it involves designing a network coding scheme. Additionally, it could belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as it involves optimizing network coding for efficient communication. The paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it involves designing a coding scheme with linear encoding/decoding complexity. Finally, it could belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CC) sub-category as network coding is often used in secure communication protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
