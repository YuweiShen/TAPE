The paper proposes an axiomatic account of program equivalence in a gradual cast calculus, which involves formal logic (LO) and type theory (TL). The paper also discusses optimizations and refactorings in gradually typed languages, which are topics in software engineering (SE) and programming languages (PL). Finally, the paper establishes a logical relations model of the type theory, which involves formal logic (LO) and type theory (TL), and also discusses the gradual guarantee, which is a topic in formal languages (FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
