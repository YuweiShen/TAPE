This is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also introduces a new propositional logic, which falls under the category of computational logic (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the correctness of reasoning, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the principles of reasoning, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
