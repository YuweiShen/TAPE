The use of message passing decoding and the focus on the tradeoff between decoding complexity and rate suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of coding theory (cs.CC). The study of the local structures in the graphs of the codes and their impact on the code rate is related to the field of graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the performance of the codes in terms of their scalability and efficiency, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
