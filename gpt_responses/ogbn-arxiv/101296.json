The method involves computing the structural dissimilarity between image patches using two widely used structural features. This work is primarily focused on computer vision (CV) and image processing, which suggests that cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the use of IQA models and structural features suggests that cs.MM (multimedia) and cs.IT (information theory) are also possible sub-categories. The proposed model is based on machine learning techniques, which suggests that cs.AI (artificial intelligence) and cs.LG (machine learning) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
