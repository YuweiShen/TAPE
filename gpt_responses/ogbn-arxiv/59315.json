The method uses novel occlusion-robust pose-maps and is trained on a new large-scale dataset (cs.LG). The approach also involves body part associations and does not require explicit bounding box prediction, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) or multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper introduces a new dataset and makes it publicly available for research purposes, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
