The use of secrecy views and virtual updates to achieve privacy also involves aspects of security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also presents a logic program with stable model semantics to specify the different ways in which the database can be virtually updated, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of null values as a means of virtual updates involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the implementation of the virtual updates, which involves software engineering principles (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
