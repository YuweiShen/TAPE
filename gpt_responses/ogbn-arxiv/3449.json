Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization techniques and graph theory, which are related to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.RO (Robotics and Automation). The paper proposes a resilient network design, which is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and the use of FSO technology is related to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
