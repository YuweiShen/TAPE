The use of constant modulus signaling is a common technique in signal processing (cs.SI) and the paper discusses the optimization of the estimator with respect to a transmission phase parameter. The paper also deals with the effect of impulsive noise, which is a topic in networked control systems (cs.NI). The paper mentions simulations, which suggests that it includes some experimental work, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the consistency and asymptotic variance of the estimator, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
