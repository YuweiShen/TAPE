The proposed method, Rectified Gradient, involves layer-wise thresholding during backpropagation, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the method in experiments with image datasets, which is a common application in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
