The use of a bot to automatically fix bugs also involves programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The fact that the bot proposes patches to human developers suggests a focus on software development (cs.SD). Finally, the paper's emphasis on the security implications of automatic program repair suggests a possible connection to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
