It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a new method for transferring CNNs from perspective to spherical images. Additionally, it could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves deep learning techniques for image recognition. The paper also mentions the use of polar angles, which could suggest it belongs to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the memory footprint of the proposed method, which could indicate it belongs to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
