The use of search-based planners and heuristics is a common approach in this field, which suggests the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and planning and scheduling (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the use of homotopy classes to guide the footstep planner, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
