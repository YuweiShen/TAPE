The experiments are conducted on image classification datasets, indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The proposed framework uses soft constraint-based formulation, which is a technique commonly used in optimization problems in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of ADMM-based methods, which are commonly used in neural network compression (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a solution to avoid penalizing all weights equally, which is a technique commonly used in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
