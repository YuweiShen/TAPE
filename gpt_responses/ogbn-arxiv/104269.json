This falls under the domain of robotics, making cs.RO the most likely category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper also describes the deep-learning approaches for visual perception used by the NimbRo team. This involves computer vision techniques, making cs.CV a likely category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The deep-learning approaches used by the NimbRo team also fall under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The deep-learning approaches used by the NimbRo team involve machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a possible category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper describes the hardware and software designs of the NimbRo robot, which involves control systems.
