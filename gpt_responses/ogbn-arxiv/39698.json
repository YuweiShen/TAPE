This involves incorporating physical/engineering constraints and expert knowledge into the neural network training process. This approach falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG), as it involves developing a new neural network architecture and training method. It also involves optimization techniques (cs.NE) to minimize the loss function. The paper also discusses the application of the TgNN to Civil Engineering (cs.CE) problems, specifically subsurface flow. Finally, the paper includes numerical simulations and visualizations (cs.CV) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
