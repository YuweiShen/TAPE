The paper also utilizes natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) to learn good representations for both code changes and reviews. The proposed attentional deep learning model involves training embeddings (cs.LG) and ranking code changes based on their similarity to reviews (cs.IR). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed model on Java projects hosted on Github (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
