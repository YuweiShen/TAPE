Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses different selection rules and their impact on termination, which is relevant to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper proposes a transformation from programs with bounded nondeterminism into strongly terminating programs, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of level mappings, which is relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the formal hierarchy between different classes of terminating logic programs, which is related to cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
