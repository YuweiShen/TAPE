The use of vector quantization (VQ) is a common approach in signal processing and information theory, which also makes cs.SI a likely category. The paper also discusses the optimization of the VQ encoder-decoder pairs, which can be related to optimization and learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the application of compressed sensing in image and video processing is a common area of research, which makes cs.CV a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
