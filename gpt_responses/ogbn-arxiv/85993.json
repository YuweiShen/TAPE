This approach falls under the broad category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of recurrent neural networks specifically suggests a focus on neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE). The symbolic representation is a dimension-reducing technique, which could also be considered a form of feature engineering or data preprocessing (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with time series data, which is a common topic in data science and statistics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
