The paper also proposes a procedure to identify obstacles for removal, which involves heuristic search planning (Theta*) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Therefore, it can also be categorized under cs.AI. The robots are acting in an environment with destructible obstacles, which requires them to have some level of autonomy and decision-making ability, making it relevant to the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also evaluates the proposed technique empirically, which involves machine learning (ML) and statistical analysis, making it relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
