The paper also focuses on machine learning software and its potential for fairer decision-making, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper discusses the issue of group discrimination in data mining packages, which is related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a method for reducing discrimination through hyperparameter optimization, which is a technique used in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
