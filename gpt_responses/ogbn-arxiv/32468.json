The use of semi-definite relaxation and graph matching techniques suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The use of randomized algorithms and outlier rejection techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of optimization techniques and the proposal of a generic framework suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
