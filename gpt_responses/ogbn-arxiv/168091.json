Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a framework that combines multiple object detectors using learning to rank, which involves machine learning techniques. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely categories. The paper also mentions the use of high-level contextual features, which suggests that it may be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
