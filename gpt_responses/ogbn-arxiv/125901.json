The design of Quiver, an experimental framework for actuation of building HVAC system, also falls under this category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses empirical experiments to demonstrate three applications, which involve identifying and mapping dependencies between sensors and actuators. This involves the use of machine learning techniques and can be categorized under AI. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the difficulty in extracting information from sensor data due to heterogeneity of systems and lack of support for interoperability. This can be seen as an information retrieval problem. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The design and implementation of Quiver can also be categorized under software engineering. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the need for standardized ontologies to represent sensors across diverse types of buildings, which can be seen as a societal issue related to the use of technology in buildings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
