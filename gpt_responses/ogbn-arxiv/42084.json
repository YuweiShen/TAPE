The paper presents a general-purpose algorithm that achieves a time complexity of $O\\left(N+M+\\big(\\ell^\\omega+\\ell\\Delta\\big) |S_\\ell|\\right)$, where $\\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication, $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of any vertex, and $|S_\\ell|$ is the number of (weakly) connected induced subgraphs of $G$ on at most $\\ell$ vertices. This algorithm is compared with existing algorithms both theoretically and experimentally, and is shown to be the best general-purpose algorithm for a certain class of graphs. The problem of counting cycles and paths in graphs is a central topic in computer science, and the paper's results are likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), scientific computing (cs.SI), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
