The proposed approach involves training a convolutional neural network using an alternative training loss that clusters weakly labeled bags in latent space. This paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it deals with image recognition. It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a new approach to training deep neural networks. Additionally, it may belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it deals with the problem of retrieving relevant patches from digital pathology images. Finally, it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with the analysis of high-resolution digital slides of breast lymph nodes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
