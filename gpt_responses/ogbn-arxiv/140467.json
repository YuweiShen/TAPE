The paper also discusses the impact of adversaries on the storage capacity of the network, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The use of regenerating codes in distributed storage systems also relates to the field of distributed computing (cs.DC) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes an optimized parameter for achieving maximum storage capacity, which can be considered as a topic related to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
