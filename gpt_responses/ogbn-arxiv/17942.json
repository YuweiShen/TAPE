The use of neural networks, specifically bidirectional LSTM and attention mechanism, suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The incorporation of CRF model for modeling dependencies among output labels indicates that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories.
