These topics are closely related to computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The paper also explores the use of the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS), which is a distributed storage system (cs.DC) and has gained popularity in the blockchain community (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the efficacy and extensibility of the proposed approach, which could be relevant to the field of machine learning and data mining (cs.DL) for detecting and mitigating malware."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
