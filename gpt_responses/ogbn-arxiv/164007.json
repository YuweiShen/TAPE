The paper discusses the use of Laplacian regularization and proposes a new approach called eigen-stratified models. These topics are commonly studied in the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data science (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of these techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and social networks (cs.SI), which are additional sub-fields where these topics are relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
