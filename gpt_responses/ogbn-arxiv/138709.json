This involves combining two previously disparate ideas - intrinsic control and information bottleneck. The paper focuses on the learning and transfer of decision states, which are important for navigation and strategic decision-making. Given this focus on reinforcement learning and transfer, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks for image processing, which suggests a possible connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of mutual information, which could potentially relate to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
