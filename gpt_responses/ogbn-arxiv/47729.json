The paper proposes a counterfactual risk minimization (CRM) approach for learning to rank (LTR) from logged data, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks (LG) and contextual bandit feedback (CL). The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of ranking performance, which can be considered as a form of evaluation (CE) and security (CR) of the E-Commerce platform."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
