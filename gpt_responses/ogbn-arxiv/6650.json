This suggests the use of artificial intelligence techniques, making cs.AI the most likely category.\n2. cs.LG - The paper may involve machine learning techniques to optimize the auction process and reduce overall system cost.\n3. cs.SY - The paper deals with the smart grid, which is a complex system of interconnected components. This suggests the use of systems engineering techniques, making cs.SY a likely category.\n4. cs.DC - The paper deals with electricity generation and distribution, which involves digital control systems. This suggests the use of digital control techniques, making cs.DC a possible category.\n5. cs.GT - The paper proposes a multiunit auction, which involves game theory concepts such as bidding and allocation.
