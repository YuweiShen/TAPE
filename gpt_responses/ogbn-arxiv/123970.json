However, this is less likely than the other categories. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not deal with social networks, but the term \"networks\" in the context of wireless communication might suggest a connection to social and information networks. However, this is less likely than the other categories. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with wireless communication, which is a subfield of networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper does not deal with machine learning, but the use of group representation techniques might suggest a connection to linear algebra, which is a foundational topic in machine learning.
