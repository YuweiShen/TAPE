The use of pairwise comparisons and the consideration of noise and erasure models suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The analysis of the algorithms' performance in terms of interactive rounds and total runtime suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
