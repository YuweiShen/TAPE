The focus on inter-procedural analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of weakest pre-conditions and fixpoint iteration is common in formal methods for program verification, which may place the paper in the formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the paper's emphasis on effective algorithms and decidability suggests that it may also be relevant to the scientific computing (cs.SC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
