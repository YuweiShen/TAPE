The paper deals with a large-scale corpus for long-form question answering, which involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The paper also mentions the use of Seq2Seq models, language modeling, and extractive baselines, which are commonly used in the fields of computational linguistics, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
