The use of regular expressions and automata also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and data structures (cs.DS). The analysis of complexity and computational hardness is a fundamental aspect of theoretical computer science (cs.CC), while the proposed syntactic constraints and ad-hoc compilation approach may involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
