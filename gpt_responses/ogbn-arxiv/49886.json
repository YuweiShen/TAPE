The paper also discusses impurity functions, which are used to measure the quality of splits in decision trees, and this falls under the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions class weighting, which is a technique used to handle imbalanced datasets, and this falls under the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well as cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
