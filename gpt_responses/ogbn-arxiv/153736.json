This can be seen as an application of AI techniques to control systems. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper employs the concept of relative observability to compute a partial-observation monolithic supervisor, which can be seen as a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design of a suitable localization procedure to decompose the supervisor into a set of local controllers, which can be seen as a software engineering problem. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper provides an example of the application of supervisor localization to a Transfer Line system, which can be seen as a robotics application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
