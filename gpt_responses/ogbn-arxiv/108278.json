The focus on action spaces and their impact on learning performance suggests a focus on robotics and control (cs.RO). The use of modern reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the choice of reward function, state, and action spaces, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of model-based controllers suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the tasks evaluated in the paper (peg insertion, hammering, and pushing) suggest a focus on computer vision and perception (cs.CV) as these tasks often require visual feedback."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
