The paper also discusses energy-efficient Ethernet interfaces and their energy models, which could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a practical method to share the load that minimizes overall energy consumption, which could be considered as a cryptographic application (cs.CR) or a performance evaluation (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
