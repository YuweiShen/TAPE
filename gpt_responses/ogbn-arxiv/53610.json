The proposed method uses deep neural networks (cs.AI) and cascaded regression (cs.LG) to perform the image cropping. The paper also mentions the use of large-scale visual aesthetic datasets (cs.MM) and the problem of lacking labelled cropping data, which can be addressed using information retrieval techniques (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
