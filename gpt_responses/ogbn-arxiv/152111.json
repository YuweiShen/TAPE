Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes leveraging assisting languages and data selection techniques, which are related to machine learning (cs.AI), deep learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions script mapping, which is a technique used in computer vision (cs.CV) to align images from different languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
