This involves techniques from machine learning (transform learning) and subspace clustering. The paper also proposes kernelized extensions to account for non-linearity. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with text data, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
