The proposed method involves clustering word forms based on their embeddings, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of cosine similarity and Jaro-Winkler edit distance also suggests a potential connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
