Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses various optimization algorithms for distributed training, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of message passing interface (MPI) for distributed training is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and the sublinear scale convergence speed is related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
