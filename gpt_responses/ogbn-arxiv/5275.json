The paper presents a unified, graph-based analysis to analyze the dependence between pairwise combinations of random variables, which is a key challenge in this learning scenario. The paper also uses Rademacher complexity and algorithmic stability to bound the generalization error of learned binary relations. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
