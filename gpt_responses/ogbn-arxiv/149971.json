The paper also mentions the use of monotonic Parametric Signal Temporal Logic (PSTL) for designing features, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The case studies mentioned in the paper are related to automotive engine testing, highway traffic analysis, and auto-grading massively open online courses, which are all examples of software engineering (cs.SE) and cybersecurity (cs.CR) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
