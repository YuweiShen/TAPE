It is also likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as it focuses on self-driving cars and their ability to see through challenging weather conditions. The use of mmWave technology also suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on autonomous systems and the use of advanced technology suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
