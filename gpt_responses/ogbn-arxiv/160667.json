This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also includes experiments on natural language processing tasks (WMT 2014 English-German machine translation), which could place it in the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV) or computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a method for scaling parameter updates based on the scale of the parameters themselves, which could be relevant to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
