The paper presents two general approaches based on neural network architectures for learning choice functions from suitable training data. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.GT (Game Theory), as these sub-categories are closely related to the problem of learning choice functions. The paper also deals with the challenges of learning choice functions, such as the context-dependency of preferences, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
