This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) in the context of multimodal datasets. Finally, the paper specifically focuses on the analysis of images and text (cs.MM) in various settings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
