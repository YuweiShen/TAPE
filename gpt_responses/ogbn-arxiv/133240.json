This makes cs.NA a very likely sub-category for this paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with training Neural ODEs, which is a machine learning technique. The proposed method is compared to standard methods such as backpropagation through explicit solvers and the adjoint technique, which are also machine learning techniques. Therefore, cs.LG is another likely sub-category for this paper. \n- cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with dynamical systems and proposes a new method for training surrogate models of small and medium-scale dynamical systems. This makes cs.SI a possible sub-category for this paper. \n- cs.SY (Control and Optimization): The paper proposes a new optimization scheme for training Neural ODEs, which involves minimizing the weighted sum of the loss function and the violation of the ODE-Net dynamics. This makes cs.SY a possible sub-category for this paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with training Neural ODEs, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The proposed method is compared to standard methods such as backpropagation"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
