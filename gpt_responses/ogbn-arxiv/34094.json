The paper also discusses algorithms for computing these explanations, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also touches on the issue of security and privacy, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of statistical independence, which is a topic in statistics and probability theory (cs.SI).
