The paper also discusses decomposition of services for efficient checking of system properties, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of formal methods for analysis suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
