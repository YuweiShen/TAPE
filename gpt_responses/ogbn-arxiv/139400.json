This is a common problem in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also introduces a new prior called \"3D as-smooth-as-possible (3D-ASAP)\" which is a regularization term that encourages smoothness in the estimated 3D geometry. This is a common technique used in machine learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its method on the KITTI dataset, which is a popular dataset for autonomous driving, falling under the category of graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
