The approach involves training a perceptor network, which is a type of neural network used for feature extraction, and a task encoding program, which maps input symbols to output actions. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and a general purpose A* planner, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes experimental results involving image data, which suggests that it may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
