This falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) as the proposed approach is applied to image datasets. The approach involves learning a common space where the conditional distributions over domains remain the same, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of SVM classifiers also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
