The fact that the paper focuses on planar graphs suggests that it may also fall under computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of algorithms and complexity theory suggests that it may also belong to data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
