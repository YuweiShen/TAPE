The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the paper uses data augmentation, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to increase the size of training datasets. The paper also discusses early stopping, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE) to prevent overfitting. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed techniques on various datasets, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
