The use of online learning algorithms and no-regret frameworks suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of Gradient Descent/Ascent and Mirror Descent also suggests a connection to optimization and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of constrained optimization suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
