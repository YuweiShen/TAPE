The proposed model uses multimodal input signals from the environment's scene context and interactions between multiple surrounding agents, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses new metrics to evaluate the diversity of trajectory predictions, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the problem of trajectory forecasting is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
