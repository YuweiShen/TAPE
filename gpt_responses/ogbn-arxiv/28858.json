The use of linear codes and direct modulation mapping of coded symbols suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the mention of message-passing based receivers suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
