It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as pose estimation is a crucial task in robotics. The use of a keypoint detector suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories may also be relevant. Finally, the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with the localization of surface keypoints on an object model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
