It also discusses the use of parallelism in these systems, which could potentially fall under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the use of operating system-level mechanisms for resource allocation (cs.OS) and the development of a framework (cs.PL) for simplifying and optimizing resource management. Finally, the paper discusses the use of production traces from real-world companies, which could potentially fall under systems and networking (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
