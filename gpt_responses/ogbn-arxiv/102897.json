The use of speech act theory and the Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also addresses the issue of communication among software applications, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of a Definite Clause Grammar for conversation policies suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
