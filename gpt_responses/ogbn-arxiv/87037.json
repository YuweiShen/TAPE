The use of Computation Tree Logic (CTL) without the next state modality (CTL-X) is also a common technique in this area. Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the limitations of the existing equivalence relation in the context of parallel composition, which involves concurrency and synchronization. This suggests that cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are also relevant sub-categories. The paper also proposes an extension of CTL-X to handle deadlock properties, which is related to the area of formal languages and automata, represented by cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) and cs.LT (Logic in Theoretical Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
