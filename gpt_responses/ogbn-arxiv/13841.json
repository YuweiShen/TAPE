The proposed approach aims to improve the detection of social bots by manipulating generations of Twitter social bots. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with the problem of detecting social bots, which can be used for malicious purposes such as spreading spam or disinformation. The proposed approach aims to improve the security of social networks by developing more effective detection techniques. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a genetic algorithm for the synthesis of online accounts, which is a machine learning technique. The proposed approach aims to create synthetic evolved versions of current state-of-the-art social bots to improve the detection of social bots. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a genetic algorithm for the synthesis of online accounts, which is a machine learning technique. The proposed approach aims to create synthetic evolved versions of current state-of-the-art social bots to improve the detection of social bots. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with the problem of detecting social bots, which can be used for malicious purposes such as spreading spam or disinformation.
