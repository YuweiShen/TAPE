This suggests that the paper could belong to multiple arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with multimedia content analysis, retrieval, and understanding. The paper's focus on analyzing movies using multiple modalities makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper's use of content-based methods for predicting high-level information about movies such as their genre or estimated budget suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper's use of visual features for analyzing movie posters and trailers makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's use of deep learning and temporal feature aggregation methods for representing video and text suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper's use of text-based features for analyzing movie plots makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
