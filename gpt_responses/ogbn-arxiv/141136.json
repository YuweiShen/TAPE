Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely categories. The paper also presents a data structure that solves the problem, which falls under cs.DB (Databases). The paper uses techniques from locality-sensitive hashing, which is a topic in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
