The paper proposes a method of using external user-generated text data to evaluate the relative importance of an entity's attributes, which involves techniques such as word/sub-word embedding and vector-based semantic matching, which are commonly used in these sub-categories. Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
