The paper specifically deals with the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial examples, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a novel dynamic programming obfuscation algorithm, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
