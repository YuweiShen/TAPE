The proposed approach involves multi-agent planning algorithms, which is a topic covered under multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also addresses the issue of limited communication in emergency scenarios, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of considering human factors in emergency response systems, which is a topic covered under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
