Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of deep learning models, which makes it relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia). As the paper deals with the issue of ensuring protection against malevolent effects, it can also be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper proposes a lightweight architecture and a multitask training scheme, which are relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
