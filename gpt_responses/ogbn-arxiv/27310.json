Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses signal modulation and communication protocols, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of thermal sensors and heat emissions to create a covert communication channel involves human-computer interaction, making cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) another likely category. The paper also involves the implementation of a prototype, which falls under the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses the exchange of data between two computers, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
