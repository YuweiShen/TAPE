The paper also proposes a new training method using policy gradient, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of expert discriminators for coherence and cohesion also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of neural language models, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of automated metrics, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) for tasks such as image captioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
