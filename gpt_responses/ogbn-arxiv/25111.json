This falls under the broad category of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and more specifically, the sub-fields of deep learning, neural networks, and symbolic regression. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper also deals with optimization and constraint satisfaction, which could place it under the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
