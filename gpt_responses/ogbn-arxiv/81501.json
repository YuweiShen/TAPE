This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses issues related to bias and discrimination, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories.
