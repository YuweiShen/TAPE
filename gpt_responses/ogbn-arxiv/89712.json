The focus on discourse planning and ordering of facts suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of machine learning algorithms also suggests that it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The evaluation of the approach in a specific domain (museum exhibit descriptions) suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
