This makes it highly likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science, which is cs.CL. Additionally, the use of spectrogram images of audio snippets suggests that the paper may also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SD) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories.
