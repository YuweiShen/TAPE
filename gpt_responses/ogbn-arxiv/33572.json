This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) as well as network infrastructure (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of digital fronthaul, which is a topic related to computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper also touches upon multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
