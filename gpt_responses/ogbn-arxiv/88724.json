It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it discusses the complexity of IR systems with the increasing diversity of languages on the web. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it uses machine learning techniques to build multilingual NER annotators. It could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with building intelligent systems for language processing. Finally, it could belong to cs.DL (Deep Learning) as it uses deep learning techniques such as word embeddings to achieve competitive performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
