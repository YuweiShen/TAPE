The paper also discusses the theoretical and practical effectiveness of the proposed compression technique, which involves randomized rounding, which could fall under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of the compression technique on the convergence speed of popular training algorithms, which could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the compression technique in the in-network aggregation (INA) framework for distributed training, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
