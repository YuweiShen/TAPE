The paper proposes a novel CNN-based stereo method and a CNN-based texture recovery method to remove noise and patterns caused by bubbles and projected patterns. These techniques are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) as they involve developing algorithms for capturing and processing visual information in dynamic environments. The paper also discusses calibration techniques, which are relevant to computer graphics (cs.GR) and geometric topology (cs.GT). Finally, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed techniques by reconstructing a live swimming fish, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
