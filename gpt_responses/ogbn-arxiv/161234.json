It could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as ASR is a subfield of natural language processing. The use of multi-objective evolutionary optimization suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the paper deals with adversarial attacks, it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
