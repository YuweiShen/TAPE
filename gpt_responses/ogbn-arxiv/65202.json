The paper also considers the use of channel state information for spatial power allocation, which falls under the category of control and systems theory (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of training symbols for channel estimation, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
