This falls under the domain of hardware architecture. \n- cs.ET (Energy): The paper focuses on reducing energy consumption in SRAMs, which is a key concern in the field of energy-efficient computing. \n- cs.DC (Data Compression): The paper mentions minimizing mean squared error of retrieved words, which is a common metric in data compression. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses an information-theoretic approach to formulate optimization problems for bit-line swings. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes algorithms to obtain optimized discrete swings, which can be seen as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
