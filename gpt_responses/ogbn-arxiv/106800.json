The paper focuses on $\\ell_2$-norm adversarial perturbations and proposes a method that combines randomized smoothing and adversarial training. The paper uses ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets for experimentation. Based on this information, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with security and privacy issues related to adversarial attacks, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for improving the performance of smoothed classifiers, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
