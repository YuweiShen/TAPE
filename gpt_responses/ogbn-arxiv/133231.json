It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it specifically focuses on the Maxout networks. Additionally, since the datasets used in the experiments are image datasets, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the paper deals with the precision of computations, it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
