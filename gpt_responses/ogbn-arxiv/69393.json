The paper also discusses the training process and the need for clean and correctly labelled training data, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of facial landmarking and pose correction algorithms also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
