Additionally, the paper also deals with image classification tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category. The use of competitive learning and the proposed Spiking Inception module also suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the proposed method for constructing multi-layer SNNs could also make the paper relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
