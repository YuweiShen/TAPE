Therefore, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the implementation of algorithms and heuristics, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The use of heuristics and node invariants also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves performance analysis and benchmarking, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
