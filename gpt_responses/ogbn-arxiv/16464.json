The framework introduces intermediate outputs to the computational graph of a network, which can be seen as a technique for optimizing the network's performance (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of intermediate outputs as a regularizer at training time, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.AI). The proposed framework can be used for embedded computer vision, which is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on age estimation, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
