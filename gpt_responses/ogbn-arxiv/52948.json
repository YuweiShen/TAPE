The approach proposed in the paper involves the use of two network branches that link semi-supervised classification with semi-supervised segmentation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of self-training, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of reducing low-level and high-level artifacts, which is a common problem in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
