It also involves communication between a server and multiple users, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The proposed interference alignment scheme involves linear algebraic techniques, which is a common tool in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between cache size and transmitted load, which is a problem in distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new scheme that achieves optimal performance, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
