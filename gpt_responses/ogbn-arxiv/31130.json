The paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks, which are commonly associated with the cs.AI sub-category. The paper also deals with robotics and control systems, which are associated with the cs.RO sub-category. The use of recurrent network layers allows the deployed policy to adapt in real time to environmental forces acting on the agent, which is associated with the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also involves the integration of guidance and navigation, which is associated with the cs.SY sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the optimization of policies using meta-learning, which is associated with the cs.NE sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
