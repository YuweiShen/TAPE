This involves bridging the gap between conceptually-based information needs and term-based inverted indexes, which suggests a focus on natural language processing and information retrieval (cs.CL, cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of a novel interface, which could fall under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper notes that the tool can contribute to efforts to create reusable linked data, which could relate to the sub-categories of digital libraries (cs.DL) and cyberinfrastructure (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
