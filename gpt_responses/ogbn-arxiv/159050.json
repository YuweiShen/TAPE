The use of distance enumerators and optimization techniques suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as well as statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed technique to a universal decoder, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
