This involves training the model on a large-scale localization dataset with fine-grained attributes and using it to detect garment items and classify clothing attributes for runway photos and fashion illustrations. This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques for model training and classification. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the work involves text analysis for attribute classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
