This technique is related to discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed method involves optimizing the WSOCP-TWSVM formulation, which is a type of neural network. Additionally, the paper mentions previous methods for imbalanced data classification that use neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
