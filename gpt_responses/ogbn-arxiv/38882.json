Therefore, cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.MA (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of Wiener filtering, which is a statistical signal processing technique, and the identification of spurious links using frequency response, which involves concepts from network science. Therefore, cs.NE (Networks and Internet Architecture) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
