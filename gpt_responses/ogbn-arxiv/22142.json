Therefore, it is likely to belong to the database (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses theoretical and practical foundations for the proposed Ontology Functional Dependencies (OFDs), which involves machine learning and inference, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the development of algorithms and optimizations, which is relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
