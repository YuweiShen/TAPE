The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The proposed network architecture and training algorithm could also make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the mention of the BRATS 2017 challenge and the evaluation of the method on a public benchmark could suggest that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
