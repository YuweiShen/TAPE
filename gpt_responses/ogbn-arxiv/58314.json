The paper also discusses the impact of a malicious expert on the system, which falls under the category of adversarial attacks (cs.CR). The paper proposes algorithms for both offline and online settings, which involve optimization and dynamic programming, respectively (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper deals with decision-making and policy optimization, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
