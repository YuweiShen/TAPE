The paper also proposes a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The algorithm's time complexity is analyzed using big-O notation, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and algorithms (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
