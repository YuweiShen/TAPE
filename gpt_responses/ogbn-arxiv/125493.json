The paper proposes the use of neural scene graph generators to learn effective visual relation features, which involves training deep learning models (cs.AI) and optimizing their performance (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on standard benchmarks in the multimedia (cs.MM) domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
