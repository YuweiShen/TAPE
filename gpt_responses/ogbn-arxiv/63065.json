This involves utilizing multiple instance learning, dynamic instance selection, and instance weighting. These techniques are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), which are subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
