Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also discusses the integration of the technique in KLEE, a symbolic execution tool, which suggests a connection to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also mentions the use of Coreutils, a benchmark for symbolic execution studies, which suggests a connection to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the modelling of the mutant killing problem, which suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
