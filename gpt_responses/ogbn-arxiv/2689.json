The use of deposits and refunds in Bitcoin transactions also relates to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and complexity theory (cs.CY). Finally, the concept of fairness in two-party computations using Bitcoin protocol may also fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
