This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of training data characteristics on the reconstruction accuracy, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of satellite images in the study suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image processing and analysis, which is related to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
