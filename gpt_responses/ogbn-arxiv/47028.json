Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper proposes distributed algorithms for solving the cooperative localization problem, which may fall under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
