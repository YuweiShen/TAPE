The proposed Neural Bloom Filter also involves memory architecture, which is a topic in computer science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of meta-learning, which is a subfield of machine learning and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the Neural Bloom Filter in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
