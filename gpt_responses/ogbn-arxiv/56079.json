The paper also discusses the computational cost of these methods, which suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) aspect. The connection between classic RungeKutta ODE solvers and Gaussian filters suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) aspect. The use of Bayesian quadrature for active learning suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) aspect. Finally, the potential applications of these methods in computer vision (cs.CV) are briefly mentioned in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
