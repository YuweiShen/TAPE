This involves using off-the-shelf models trained on static images and adding convolutional or conv-LSTM layers trained with a dataset for video saliency prediction. The paper also introduces a new dataset called EgoMon, which consists of egocentric videos recorded by three subjects in both free-viewing and task-driven set ups. The results of the study indicate that temporal adaptation is beneficial when the viewer is not moving and observing the scene from a narrow field of view. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Other possible sub-categories include multimedia (cs.MM), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
