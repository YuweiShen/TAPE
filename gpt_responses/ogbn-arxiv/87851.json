The paper proposes two novel hybrid filtering techniques that utilize the neural probabilistic language model algorithm doc2vec to maximize the predictive performance of look-alike modeling algorithms. The paper also applies these methods to data from a large mobile ad exchange and additional app metadata acquired from the Apple App store and Google Play store. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper deals with mobile app usage and metadata, which could also place it in the sub-categories cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
