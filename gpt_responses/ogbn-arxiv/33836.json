The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as autonomous driving and drone navigation, suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the mention of \"deep instance segmentation models\" implies that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
