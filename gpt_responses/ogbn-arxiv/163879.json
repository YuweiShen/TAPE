This falls under the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV) as well as natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a novel approach using a multimodal information bottleneck, which could fall under the sub-categories of statistical learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, which could fall under the sub-category of system and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
