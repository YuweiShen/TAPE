The framework also has implications for human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and robotics (cs.RO) as it involves analyzing and representing reality from a virtual agent's perspective. Additionally, the paper may fall under the graphics (cs.GR) category as it deals with virtual and augmented reality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
