Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new mechanism for improving the hard-mining ability of DML methods, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning (LG). Additionally, the paper deals with memory management and efficiency, which could be relevant to multimedia (MM) and information retrieval (IR). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on large-scale datasets, which could be relevant to natural language processing (CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
