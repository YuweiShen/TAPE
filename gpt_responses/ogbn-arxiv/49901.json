The use of tensor decomposition for this purpose suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of structured data analysis (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing text data, which falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the problem of detecting review abuse can also be seen as a form of cybersecurity (cs.CR), as it involves identifying and preventing malicious behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
