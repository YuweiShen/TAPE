Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also discusses the feasibility of using deep networks and the use of early stop to kill models with bad performance, which are relevant to sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
