The paper proposes a method for avoiding catastrophic forgetting through adversarial feature alignment, which involves aligning the features of the old and new tasks. This method is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
