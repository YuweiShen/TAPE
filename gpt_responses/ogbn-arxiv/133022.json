The use of dynamical systems is also a common approach in robotics. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for manipulating orthogonal coordinates to solve a local minimal problem, which is a common problem in systems and control. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for obstacle avoidance, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The use of dynamical systems is also a common approach in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for manipulating orthogonal coordinates, which can be seen as a form of feature engineering. Feature engineering is a common task in machine learning. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, obstacle avoidance is a common problem in autonomous vehicles, which often rely on computer vision for perception. The use of dynamical systems is also a common approach in autonomous vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
