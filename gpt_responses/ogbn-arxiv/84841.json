Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses video quality metrics and rate-distortion mapping, which are related to multimedia processing and analysis, making cs.MM (Multimedia) another likely sub-category. The paper also uses concepts from information theory, such as effective capacity, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as another possible sub-category. The paper also discusses fairness-based resource allocation and scheduling policies, which are related to control and systems engineering, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses adaptive modulation and coding and user-subcarrier assignment, which are related to computer vision and image processing, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
