The use of coherence-based recovery guarantees and l1-norm based separation algorithms suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the mention of D-RIP recovery results suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the use of hybrid setups and the formulation of a unified framework suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
