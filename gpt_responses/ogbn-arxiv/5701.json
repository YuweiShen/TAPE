This involves game-theoretic concepts such as multi-bilateral negotiation and product differentiation. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational approach to cost allocation in peer-to-peer electricity markets, which involves mapping exchanges onto the grid and rethinking the approach to sharing costs related to usage of common infrastructure and services. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the deployment of distributed energy resources and a more proactive demand side, which involves the use of social and information networks to coordinate supply and demand. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes different ways of attributing costs in peer-to-peer electricity markets, which can affect the trades of market participants and related grid usage. This involves machine learning concepts such as optimization and prediction. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the deployment of distributed energy resources and a more proactive demand side, which involves the use of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing to coordinate supply and demand."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
