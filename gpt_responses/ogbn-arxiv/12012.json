Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a space-efficient algorithm, which involves techniques based on bit manipulation and data structures. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). The use of bit manipulation and data structures is also relevant to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
