The paper discusses neural models for question answering over documents, which falls under the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The paper proposes a method to select a minimal set of sentences to feed into the QA model, which involves techniques from information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
