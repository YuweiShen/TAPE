This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed technique aims to support a large number of groups of users with different angles of departures (AoDs), which is relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of millimeter wave lens-based reconfigurable antenna systems can have applications in multimedia communication, such as high-speed data transfer and video streaming.\n4. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a new multiple access technique for wireless communication, which falls under the scope of communications and networking.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed technique involves reconfigurable antenna systems, which can be considered as a control system. Therefore, it can be relevant to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
