This is a common topic in the study of social and information networks.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses a combinatorial problem of finding infection sources in a network, which can be seen as a control problem in the context of systems and control.\n3. cs.SD (Sound): Although not directly related to sound, the paper uses the concept of Jordan centers, which is a mathematical concept that has applications in acoustics and sound engineering.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with network topology and infection spreading, which are relevant topics in networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new source estimator for infection spreading models, which involves developing algorithms and data structures for finding the Jordan center and the k-Jordan center set."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
