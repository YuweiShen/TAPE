The use of linear codes and coding strategies suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The consideration of binary inputs and the use of new sufficient conditions suggest a possible connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and computer communication (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
