This falls under the domain of robotics.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the use of head-mounted displays and programming environments for interaction with robots, which is a key aspect of HCI.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper mentions the use of AR, which involves the overlay of virtual objects onto the real world. This falls under the domain of computer graphics.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper may involve the use of computer vision techniques for tracking the position and orientation of the head-mounted display and/or the robot.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of systems for enabling end-to-end application of AR in HRI, which involves software engineering aspects such as programming and connectivity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
