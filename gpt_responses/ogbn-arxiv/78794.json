The focus is on dealing with concept drift, which is a challenge in data mining. The paper also discusses the assumption of independence in most of the literature and how it contradicts the presence of concept drift. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
