Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also focuses on AI techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses security restrictions and deployment issues, which could place it in cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper mentions the use of high-level scripting languages and frameworks, which could suggest a connection to cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
