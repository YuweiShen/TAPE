It introduces a new notion of capacity for the many-access channel model and characterizes it for the Gaussian case with random user activities. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is motivated by emerging systems with a massive number of users in an area, such as machine-to-machine communication systems and sensor networks. The many-access channel model is a common model in networking and communication systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a system model (many-access channel) and proposes a new paradigm for studying its fundamental limits. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the many-access channel model can be used to study the performance of multimedia communication systems. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but the many-access channel model can be used to study the security of communication systems in the presence of multiple users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
