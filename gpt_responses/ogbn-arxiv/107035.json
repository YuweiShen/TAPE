The fact that the graphs considered are planar or belong to minor-closed families suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category, as these classes of graphs have special properties that can be exploited algorithmically. The problem of finding minimum weighted subgraphs subject to connectivity requirements is also related to the graph theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Finally, the use of approximation algorithms and analysis of approximation ratios suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
