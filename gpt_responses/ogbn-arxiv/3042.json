The use of degeneracy as a parameter suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). The application to color reconfiguration suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
