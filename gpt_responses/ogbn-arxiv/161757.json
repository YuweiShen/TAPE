The method uses multiple patch sizes and convolution kernel sizes to acquire multi-scale information, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The network learns to recognize important information for classification based on training data, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.AI). The method also requires a single anatomical MR image only, which is a common topic in medical imaging (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents results on five different data sets, which is a common approach in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
