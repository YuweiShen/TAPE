It also conducts machine learning experiments to evaluate the proposed scheme. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as the proposed mechanism is designed for wireless networks and considers bandwidth and time limitations. \n\nAdditionally, it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it proposes a cooperative learning mechanism that involves multiple agents (mobile clients and server) and aims to improve the overall system performance. \n\nIt may also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as FL is a privacy-preserving learning mechanism and the proposed scheme aims to improve the model performance while maintaining data privacy. \n\nFinally, it could belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as FL is a distributed learning mechanism and the proposed scheme involves the coordination of multiple agents to achieve a common goal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
