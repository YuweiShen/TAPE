This approach involves information-theoretic concepts such as channel coding and decision-feedback, making cs.IT a likely category.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with phase-noise mitigation in OFDM systems, which is a key issue in wireless communication systems. The paper proposes a new algorithm for phase-noise compensation and compares it with existing methods, which is a common theme in the cs.COMM category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new algorithm for phase-noise compensation in OFDM systems, which involves modeling the phase-noise statistics and estimating the codebook index along with other parameters. This approach involves system modeling and control, making cs.SY a likely category.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with phase-noise mitigation in wireless communication systems, which is a key issue in networking and internet architecture.
