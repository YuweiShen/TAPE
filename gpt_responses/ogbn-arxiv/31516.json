This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and computational topology (cs.DS, cs.DM, cs.GT). The paper also discusses the application of these techniques to scientific data, which could fall under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
