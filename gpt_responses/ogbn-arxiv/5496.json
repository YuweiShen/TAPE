The paper also discusses the integration of the authentication framework into all aspects of the automotive product lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates, which falls under the subfield of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper addresses the real-time constraints and low computational resources of the automotive domain, which is a characteristic of cyber-physical systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of cryptography to provide secure communication channels, which is a subfield of cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper evaluates the timing requirements of the authentication framework using a discrete event simulator, which falls under the subfield of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
