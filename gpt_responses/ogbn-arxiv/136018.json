The paper also discusses the use of a decentralised network and a low-complexity merging algorithm, which are relevant to the sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The paper presents a novel algorithm for PCA, which is a common technique in machine learning and data science, and thus falls under the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of limited memory, which is relevant to the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT), and the use of numerical simulations, which is relevant to the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
