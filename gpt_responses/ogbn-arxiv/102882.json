The use of linear codes and exact repair to recover from node failures suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The focus on security against eavesdropping implies that the paper may be related to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). The new results on subspace intersection suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the study of the maximum secure file size in different scenarios may involve computational complexity considerations, which could place the paper in the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
