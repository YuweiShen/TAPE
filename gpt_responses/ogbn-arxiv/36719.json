The paper also proposes new approaches to multi-net ensembling, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks (cs.MM) and statistical aggregation (cs.LG). The paper evaluates a broad range of deep architectures, which involves analysis of their behavior and performance (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with semantic labelling of short videos, which involves natural language processing techniques such as feature space aggregation and mid-stage AV fusion (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
