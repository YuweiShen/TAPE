The paper proposes a new exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The evaluation of the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks suggests that it falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a new form of policy gradient that reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity, which is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
