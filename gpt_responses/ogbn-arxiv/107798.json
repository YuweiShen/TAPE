This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves the design of a collective tracking controller, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MA) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses trade-offs and performance limitations, which could involve optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
