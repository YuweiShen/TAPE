This involves measuring transaction times and network availability for connected vehicles transmitting warning messages. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the potential gain of multi-access by simultaneously transmitting over several operators, which falls under the category of cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). The use of different protocols such as UDP, TCP, and HTTPS suggests a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the context of C-ITS and the use of connected vehicles could also relate to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
