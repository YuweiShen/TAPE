The paper also discusses techniques for bounding the performance of these codes, which could fall under the subfields of statistical inference (cs.SI) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper characterizes the achievable region of rate-exponent vectors, which could be of interest to researchers in the machine learning (cs.LG) subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
