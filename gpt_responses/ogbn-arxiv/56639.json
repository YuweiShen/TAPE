The paper specifically focuses on using character-level translation to parse sentences annotated with Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP and related fields. \n\nThe paper also uses machine learning techniques, such as sequence-to-sequence models and pre-training, which are common in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nAdditionally, the paper deals with optimizing the training process and improving performance, which are topics that fall under the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
