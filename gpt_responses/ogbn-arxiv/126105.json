The paper also discusses the implementation of the decoder in hardware, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). The use of optimization techniques and exploration of various design choices suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of quantization, which is a common technique in signal processing (cs.ET). Finally, the paper discusses the ability of the decoder to handle overlapped loading of frames, which is a feature commonly used in communication systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
