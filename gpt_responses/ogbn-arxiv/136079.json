This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on the interaction between the user and the system, which suggests that it may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories.
