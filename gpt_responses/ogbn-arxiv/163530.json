This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The datasets used in the experiments are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the use of a ranker model suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
