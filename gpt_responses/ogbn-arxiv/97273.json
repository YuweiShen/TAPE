The use of crowdsourcing for collecting human acceptability judgements suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models for sentence compression, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of information retrieval techniques for sentence compression, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
