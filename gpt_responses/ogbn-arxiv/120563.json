The paper also discusses the probability of failure, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of random codebooks suggests a connection to randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the union bound, which is a technique commonly used in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on achievability proofs and the use of probability suggests a connection to machine learning and statistical learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
