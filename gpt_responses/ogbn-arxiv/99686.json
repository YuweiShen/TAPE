It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a regularization technique to improve the performance of the learning algorithm. Additionally, it may be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with improving the performance of deep learning models. The paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image-level feature embedding. Finally, it may be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as feature descriptors are often used in information retrieval tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
