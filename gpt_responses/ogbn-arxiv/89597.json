The use of feedback and the consideration of intermediate nodes generating private randomness suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI). The presence of eavesdropping channels and the focus on secrecy suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). The development of polynomial time algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of mathematical modeling and analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
