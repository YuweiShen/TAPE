The paper also discusses adjusting hyper-parameters and combining different pooling methods, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the improved models on image classification databases, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
