The paper proposes a solution using pseudo-rehearsal, which involves generating representative items from previous tasks to help the network retain its knowledge. This is a topic that is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, given that the paper focuses on image classification tasks, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
