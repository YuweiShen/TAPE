The proposed technology involves the use of both RF and lightwave bands, which could also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and optics (cs.PH). Additionally, the paper discusses potential future research directions, which could be related to other topics in computer science, such as optimization (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
