This involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) to generate representative samples of the pore structure. The paper also discusses the use of statistical measures to compare the generated samples with real-world data, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
