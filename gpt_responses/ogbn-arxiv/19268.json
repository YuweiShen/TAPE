Additionally, the paper discusses the use of model predictive control, which is a popular optimization-based control method that can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of feed-forward neural networks, which is a common type of neural network used in control systems and can be categorized under neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance evaluation of the proposed control strategy, which can be categorized under simulation and modeling (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
