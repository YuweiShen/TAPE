The use of expectation propagation (EP) and minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The fact that the system is non-coherent and involves multiple antennas suggests that it may also belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the use of Grassmannian signaling and the analysis of the system's performance in terms of bit error rate suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
