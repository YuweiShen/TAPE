The use of deep learning models and feature extraction methods also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method on publicly-available datasets related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) further supports these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
