The paper also addresses the core sampling problem in evaluating a policy through simulation, which is a common issue in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes an algorithm that offers improved performance with less computational effort, which is a topic of interest in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
