It also involves the use of multiple antennas and the study of the geometry of the problem, which are topics related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the feasibility of interference alignment, which is a topic related to communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper involves the use of matrices and linear algebra, which are topics related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
