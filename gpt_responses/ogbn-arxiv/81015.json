This suggests that the paper could belong to the computer vision sub-category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on cross-modal retrieval, which involves searching for similar items across different modalities (e.g., images and text). This suggests that the paper could belong to the information retrieval sub-category.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multimodal retrieval, which involves searching for similar items across multiple modalities. This suggests that the paper could belong to the multimedia sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for cross-modal retrieval, which involves learning good data representations and generating compact binary codes. This suggests that the paper could belong to the machine learning sub-category.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with cross-modal retrieval involving text data, which suggests that the paper could belong to the computation and language sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
