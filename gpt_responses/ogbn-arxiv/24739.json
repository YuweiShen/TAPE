The paper argues that conflict resolution techniques are important for the development of autonomous agile teams, which is a key concern in software engineering. \n\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper also touches upon the need for software engineers to have additional training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution. This suggests a focus on the human aspect of software development, which is a key concern in the human-computer interaction domain. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the importance of managing conflicts and disagreements efficiently in teams. This is a key concern in the social and information networks domain, which focuses on the study of social networks and their impact on information dissemination and behavior. \n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper also touches upon the social dynamics of software development teams and the need for conflict resolution techniques. This suggests a focus on the social impact of technology, which is a key concern in the computers and society domain. \n\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - While this paper is primarily focused on software engineering, it also touches upon the need for negotiation skills and conflict resolution, which are important in a variety of domains.
