The paper proposes an extension of an existing offline evaluation method for the continuous armed bandit problem, which is a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
