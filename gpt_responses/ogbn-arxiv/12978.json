Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. FRI methods are also related to fuzzy logic (FL), which is a subfield of AI and ML, so cs.FL is also a likely sub-category. Additionally, FRI methods can be applied in control systems (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
