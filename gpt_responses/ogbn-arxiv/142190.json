The paper proposes a novel framework for domain-specific video summarization, which involves learning the importance of segments and desired summary characteristics for a particular domain. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video summarization, which is a multimedia task. The paper proposes a novel evaluation measure for assessing the quality of video summary, which is more naturally suited for the task at hand. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with summarizing videos, which is a form of information retrieval. The paper proposes a framework for domain-specific video summarization, which involves learning the importance of segments and desired summary characteristics for a particular domain. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a framework for domain-specific video summarization, which involves learning the importance of segments and desired summary characteristics for a particular domain. The paper also discusses the use of ratings as a more efficient way of incorporating domain-specific relevances into a summary. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a novel evaluation measure for assessing the quality of video summary, which is more naturally suited for the task at hand. The measure is richer in appropriately modeling desirable and undesirable characteristics of a summary."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
