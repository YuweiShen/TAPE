It also involves logic (cs.LO) and computational complexity (cs.CC) in the form of CSPs and FPPs. The mention of MMSNP suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of tree-depth decomposition and bounded expansion suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
