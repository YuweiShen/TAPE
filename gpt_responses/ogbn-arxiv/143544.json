The use of experimental methods from cognitive psychology suggests a potential overlap with neural networks and neuroscience (cs.NE), while the investigation of how models generate novel attributes and their combinations suggests a potential overlap with natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
