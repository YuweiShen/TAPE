The use of multiple sites and the ability to discard outliers suggest a distributed setting, which is often studied in the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) sub-category. The proposed algorithm is based on constructing small summaries of the data, which is a common technique in Large Scale Learning (cs.LG) and Data Compression (cs.DC). The paper also mentions experiments on both real and synthetic data, which suggests a focus on Database (cs.DB) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
