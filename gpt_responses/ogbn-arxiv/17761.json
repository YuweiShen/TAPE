This method is validated using several indoor and outdoor public datasets, taken under different environmental conditions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of Bayesian frameworks, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
