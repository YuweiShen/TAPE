The paper also discusses the use of a modified Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) framework with a VGG-16 network as the base network, which is a popular deep learning architecture used in computer vision tasks and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions achieving scale invariance, which is a common problem in computer vision and falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of an image pyramid, which is a common technique in robotics and falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of detection accuracy and recall, which are common evaluation metrics in information retrieval and falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
