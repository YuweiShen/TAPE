This involves optimizing for efficient multi-task models, which is a common theme in machine learning and artificial intelligence research (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). The proposed method is benchmarked on Visual Decathlon, which is a computer vision dataset (cs.CV, cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
