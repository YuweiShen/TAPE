This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The method also involves selecting reliable perturbations from a constellation lattice, which is related to signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a practical solution to the problem of initial erroneous decoding decisions, which is related to system identification (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
