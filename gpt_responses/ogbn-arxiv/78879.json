This falls under the purview of information theory.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Robust mean estimation is a problem that arises in machine learning, particularly in the context of outlier detection. The paper proposes algorithms for this problem, which makes it relevant to the machine learning community.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of robust mean estimation and gives worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence. This makes it relevant to the algorithms community.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper gives worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence for the computational hardness of improving error rates of current polynomial-time robust mean estimation algorithms. This makes it relevant to the computational complexity community.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the problem of robust mean estimation, which is relevant to the control theory community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
