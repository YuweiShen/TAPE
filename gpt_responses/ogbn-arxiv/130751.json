Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a multi-branch network PAM that jointly learns local and global features, which involves deep learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. The paper also discusses the problem of few-example person re-identification, which is related to few-shot learning, a subfield of machine learning. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible categories. Finally, the paper proposes a sampling strategy based on the relative distance between classes, which is related to classification and clustering, and hence, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
