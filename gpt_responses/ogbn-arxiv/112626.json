This falls under the category of formal languages and automata theory, which is covered by cs.FL. The paper also discusses the expressiveness and complexity of these logics, which is related to computational complexity theory, covered by cs.DS. The use of these logics for verifying properties of recursive state machines (RSMs) also falls under the category of software engineering, covered by cs.SE. The paper also mentions the three-variable property of first-order logic over nested words, which is a topic in mathematical logic, covered by cs.LO. Finally, the paper discusses the use of summary paths in NWTL, which is related to programming languages and compilers, covered by cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
