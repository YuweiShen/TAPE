The paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques applied to knowledge bases, which are topics covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. Specifically, the use of neural encoder-decoder models and multi-level copy mechanisms suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL), while the incorporation of answer-aware loss and the use of machine learning techniques suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The task of generating questions over knowledge bases also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and database systems (cs.DB) concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
