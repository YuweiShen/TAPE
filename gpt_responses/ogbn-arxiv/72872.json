The algorithm is evaluated on both standard continuous optimization benchmarks and the strategic game Hearthstone. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper proposes a new algorithm for optimization and reinforcement learning. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper discusses the performance of the algorithm on a game and uses techniques from CMA-ES, which is a popular optimization algorithm in machine learning. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm for optimization. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as the paper evaluates the algorithm on a strategic game. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the paper discusses the use of the algorithm for design and testing, which are relevant to control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
