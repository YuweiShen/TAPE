The focus on data augmentation as a means to improve performance suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of regression models and the emphasis on performance metrics such as the intraclass correlation coefficient suggest that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
