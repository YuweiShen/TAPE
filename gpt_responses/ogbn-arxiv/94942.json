The paper also discusses the use of channel state information (CSI) and decoding schemes, which are relevant to the sub-categories of network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with multiple antennas at each node, which falls under the sub-category of multiple access (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of power constraints on the channel capacity, which is relevant to the sub-category of computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
