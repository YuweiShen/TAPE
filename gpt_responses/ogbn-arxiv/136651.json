This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses clustering and classification, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the datasets used in the paper are related to handwriting recognition (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
