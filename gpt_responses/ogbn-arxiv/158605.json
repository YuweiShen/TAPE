It could also belong to cs.SD (Sound) as it involves microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it uses neural networks for end-to-end training. It could also be classified under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it involves optimizing beamforming components within the recognition architecture. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.SI (Signal Processing) as it involves processing of speech signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
