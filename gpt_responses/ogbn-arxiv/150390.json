Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also introduces a new model and proposes an online hard example mining strategy, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The use of optical flow and the fusion of feature maps suggest that cs.MM (Multimedia) could also be a relevant category. The paper also involves classification and detection tasks, which are related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets suggests that cs.IR (Information Retrieval) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
