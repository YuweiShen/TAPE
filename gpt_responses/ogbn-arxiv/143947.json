This involves channel estimation and spectral efficiency, which are topics typically covered in the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the performance of massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which falls under the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) and Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with cellular networks, which is a topic covered in the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
