Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which covers the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. The paper also involves system modeling, control, and optimization, which are related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Moreover, the paper discusses the use of linear processing and matched filtering, which are relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
