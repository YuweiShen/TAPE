The proposed algorithm also involves optimization and decision-making, which are common topics in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of an oracle to provide additional information, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a new exact algorithm for POMDPs, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
