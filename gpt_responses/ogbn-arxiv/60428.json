The codes are also relevant to communications systems and security, which could place it in the categories of cryptography (cs.CR) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of encoding and decoding algorithms, which could place it in the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with constructing codes to specific specifications, which could place it in the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
