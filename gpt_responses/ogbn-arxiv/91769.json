The methodology proposed involves the use of multivariate polynomials and tensor decomposition, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of optimization techniques to obtain the parsimonious representation of the model, which is a common theme in neural networks and optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the experimental verification of the model is done on a benchmark problem, which falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
