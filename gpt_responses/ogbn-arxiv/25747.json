The paper specifically focuses on the recent application of deep representation learning in this field. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of different methods, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, which indicates that it may be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
