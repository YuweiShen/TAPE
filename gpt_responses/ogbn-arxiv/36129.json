The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture (Count-ception) and a new approach to counting objects in images (fully convolutional redundant counting), which are both relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of object localization in justifying the count predictions, which is a topic commonly studied in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
