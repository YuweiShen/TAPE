The paper also uses algebraic results from clone theory, which is a topic in theoretical computer science and logic (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions that the studied problems have connections to machine learning (cs.AI) and constraint satisfaction (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
