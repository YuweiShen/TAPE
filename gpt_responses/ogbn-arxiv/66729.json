This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and database systems (cs.DB), as well as software engineering (cs.SE) and cybersecurity (cs.CY) since process mining can help identify sources of non-compliance and potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the paper mentions compliance requirements, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
