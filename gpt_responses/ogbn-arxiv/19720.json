Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper proposes an efficient and modular neural architecture for VQA, which involves training a sparsely activated CNN. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
