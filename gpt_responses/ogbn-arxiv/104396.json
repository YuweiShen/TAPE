This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed solution involves generating random noise and privacy budget dynamically for different queries, which involves database systems (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed solution involves using real-world datasets, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
