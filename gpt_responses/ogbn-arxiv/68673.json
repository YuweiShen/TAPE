This indicates that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the usage of patent metadata and citation structures, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the creation of initial working sets and final re-ranking regression models, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on patent search and analysis could also place it in the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
