The paper proposes a new synchronization scheme called LB-BSP that works by coordinately setting the batch size of each worker so that they can finish batch processing at around the same time. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
