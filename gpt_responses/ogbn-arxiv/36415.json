This falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of a swarm-specific scripting language, Buzz, also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions testing the performance of their approach with a fleet of micro-UAVs, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for navigation and obstacle avoidance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
