The paper also discusses the use of stochastic and binary computation, which falls under the category of Approximation Algorithms and Randomized Algorithms (cs.AR). The paper also addresses the challenges of operating power constraints and energy budgets, which are relevant to the Embedded Systems (cs.ET) category. The paper's focus on image classification and speech recognition suggests that it may also belong to the Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
