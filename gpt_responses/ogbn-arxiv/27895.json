The proposed approach relies on linguistic resources such as WordNet and WordNetDomains, which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel concept weighting scheme, which could also be of interest to researchers in deep learning (cs.DL) who work on developing new techniques for text representation and feature weighting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
