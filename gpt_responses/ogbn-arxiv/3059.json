The paper involves the use of computational methods and algorithms to solve problems related to differential equations and polygonal systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics) and cs.MS (Mathematical Software). Additionally, the paper involves numerical methods and algorithms, which could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
