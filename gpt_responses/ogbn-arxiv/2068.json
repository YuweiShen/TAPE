The use of deep learning models and word embedding features from free-text discharge summaries suggests that this paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the use of structured clinical data from MIMIC-III and the impact of different combinations of features extracted from structured and/or unstructured data suggest that this paper could also belong to the sub-categories of cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
