The system is based on visual-SLAM, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The system also involves estimation procedures, which can be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system is validated using the Pepper robot, which involves machine learning techniques for robot control (cs.LG). Finally, the system involves control and automation of the robot's movements, which can be related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
