The paper also discusses the use of geometric techniques such as range trees (cs.CG) and the application of information theory (cs.IT) in the analysis of the data structures. Finally, the paper presents a number of linear-space data structures, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
