This mechanism aims to stabilize the system while allowing peers to act greedily. Given the focus on networking and distributed systems, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also touches on distributed computing (cs.DC), data structures (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and information theory (cs.IT) in its proposed mechanism."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
