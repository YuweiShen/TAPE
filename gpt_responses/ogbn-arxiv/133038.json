This involves estimation, planning, control, and mapping problems, which are all related to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the effect of varying illumination on the system performance, which suggests the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The proposed solution involves autonomous decision-making, which is a key aspect of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also needs to operate in a hazardous environment, which requires safety and reliability considerations, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the experimental results obtained from the system, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques for data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
