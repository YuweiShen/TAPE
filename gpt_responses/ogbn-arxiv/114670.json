The use of policy sketches and subtasks suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the maze navigation and Minecraft-inspired crafting games suggest a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The joint optimization of policies across tasks suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
