Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The use of discrete translation lexicons and minimum risk training also involves machine learning techniques, which could place the paper under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The optimization of the MT system for BLEU score could also involve optimization algorithms, which could place the paper under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper could also involve information retrieval techniques, which could place it under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
