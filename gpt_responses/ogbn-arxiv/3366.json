The paper also discusses scaling and benchmarking of these methods, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also includes experiments on visual navigation using reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations, which could also fall under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL) if the evaluation involves language-based tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
