The paper also proposes new loss functions and training strategies, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation metrics for the generated paraphrases, which involves measuring semantic content preservation and fluency, both of which are important in information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
