These are classic optimization problems in computer science, and are typically studied in the areas of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational complexity (cs.CC), and game theory (cs.GT). Given that the paper proposes a novel algorithmic technique based on half-edges, matchings, and edge coloring, it is likely to be of interest to researchers in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
