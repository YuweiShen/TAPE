The paper focuses on encoding each concept in the knowledge graph as a sphere and each instance as a vector in the same semantic space. This approach is related to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
