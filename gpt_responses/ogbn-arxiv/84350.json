This involves reconciling possible conflicts among users' preferences and finding Pareto-optimal objects. The paper proposes an objective Pareto-based aggregation for group preferences and introduces an elegant transformation of categorical attribute values into numerical values to accelerate the solutions to the two problems. This work involves techniques from databases (cs.DB) for indexing and querying large datasets, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for defining an objective Pareto-based aggregation, data structures (cs.DS) for index structures, information retrieval (cs.IR) for ranking objects with respect to group preferences, and machine learning (cs.LG) for modeling individual preferences and reconciling conflicts among them."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
