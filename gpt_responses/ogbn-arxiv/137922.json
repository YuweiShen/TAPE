Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of crowdsourcing for creating a benchmark corpus, which falls under the sub-category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper proposes a baseline system and evaluation protocol, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with educational topics, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
