The paper proposes a novel optimization-based perspective on the classical MUSIC algorithm, which is a well-known approach for spectral estimation, and extends it to handle damped spectrally sparse signals. The paper also provides exact recovery guarantees for the proposed algorithms and quantifies how the sample complexity depends on the true spectral parameters. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SP (Speech Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
