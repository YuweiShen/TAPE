The paper presents a linear-algebraic framework that generalizes eigenvector-based centralities for two popular classes of multilayer networks: multiplex networks with layers encoding different types of relationships and temporal networks in which the relationships change in time. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including social informatics (cs.SI), systems and control (cs.SY), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), networked systems (cs.NI), and software engineering (cs.SE). However, given the focus on network analysis and centrality measures, we believe that cs.SI and cs.SD (systems and control) are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SY, cs.DS, and cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
