This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also considers the impact of channel state information (CSI) on the performance of the scheme, which is a key aspect of control and optimization in networked systems (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and beamforming also has applications in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
