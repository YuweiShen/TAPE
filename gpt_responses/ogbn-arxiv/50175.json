This includes contents, users, devices, logical and physical points, and services. The paper also discusses the use of Information Centric Networking principles to extend ICN functionality beyond content retrieval. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other possible sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) due to the discussion of multiple network realms and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) due to the mention of logical and physical points involved in communication. Additionally, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) could also be possible sub-categories due to the focus on name resolution and the ability to accommodate gradual migration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
