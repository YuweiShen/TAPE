The proposed algorithm for constructing universal adversarial perturbations involves computing the singular vectors of Jacobian matrices, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the correlation between the maximal singular value of the Jacobian matrix and the fooling rate of the corresponding singular vector, which is a topic related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the generalization of the constructed perturbations across networks, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
