The paper also discusses the dynamic resizing of service capacity, which is a key aspect of data center management (cs.DC). The paper uses optimization-based modeling and stochastic modeling, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the statistical properties of workload, which is relevant to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
