The focus is on virtual reality applications, which involve capturing and retargetting 3D human pose (cs.GR). The proposed method involves training cascaded regressors based on Gradient Boosting algorithm, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The method also incorporates hierarchical kinematics model of human pose into the learning procedure, which involves modeling the motion of rigid bodies (cs.RO). Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthesized human motion data and real human movements data, which involves processing and analyzing multimedia data (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
