The use of reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks (NN) for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation suggests that the paper could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the application of the method to a rotational/translational actuator system suggests that the paper could also be classified under robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
