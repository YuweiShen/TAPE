The paper proposes a new approach to training node classifiers in cascade detectors, which involves pruning weak classifiers that contribute little to the asymmetric learning criterion. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as model reduction and asymmetric classifier construction, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG and cs.AI. The paper also presents experimental results on face and car data sets, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
