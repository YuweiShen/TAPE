The approach involves cooperative detection and tracking (CDT) of a subject using multiple MAVs, which requires active perception-based formation control. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves computer vision techniques for tracking the subject, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves control systems and optimization techniques for achieving optimal view-point configurations, which suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques for deriving the decoupling using Gaussian observation model assumptions, which suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves multiple real robot experiments and comparisons, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
