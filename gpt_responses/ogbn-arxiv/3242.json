Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the benefits of neural networks for language acquisition, which falls under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the infrastructure for modeling human sentence processing, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
