The paper deals with the problem of Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires joint image and language understanding. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper proposes a novel Spatial Memory Network that uses an attention mechanism to select relevant regions of the image based on the question, which involves modeling spatial inference. This suggests that the paper is also likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
