The Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) is also mentioned, which testifies the success of formalized mathematics in Isabelle/HOL. These topics are closely related to logic in computer science. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the PIDE project and its underlying document model, which includes built-in parallel evaluation and asynchronous interaction. These are software engineering concepts. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses languages that are not connected to logic and proof in Isabelle, but taken from a broader repertoire of mathematics on the computer. This could be related to programming languages used for mathematical computation. \n- cs.DL (Digital Libraries): The paper discusses formal mathematical documents and their interaction in Isabelle/PIDE. This could be relevant to digital libraries that store and manage formal documents. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper discusses formalized mathematics and its application in Isabelle/HOL. This could be relevant to symbolic computation, which involves manipulating mathematical expressions symbolically."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
