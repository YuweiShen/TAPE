This falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves dealing with uncertainties and disturbances, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of full-body simulations suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) for generating realistic simulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
