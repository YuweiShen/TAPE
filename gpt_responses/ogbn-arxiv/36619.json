The paper also discusses applications in machine learning (cs.LG) and sensor networks (cs.SI), which are related to the problem of detecting signals in noise. Additionally, the paper presents a new analytical result, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
