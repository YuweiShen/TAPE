The proposed approach involves selecting acoustic embeddings based on linguistic information, which also involves machine learning techniques (cs.SD). The paper also discusses the contribution of semantic and syntactic features, which are related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves training a model to generate speech, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
