The use of 2-Sat formulation and Hanani-Tutte theorem suggests that the paper belongs to the computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DM) sub-categories. The algorithmic aspect of the paper and the use of polynomial-time algorithms suggest that it may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.GT) sub-categories. Finally, the use of level planarity and radial level planarity suggests that the paper may also belong to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
