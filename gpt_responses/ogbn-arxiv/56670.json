This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the practical issues of implementing these techniques, which could fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper provides new mathematical results, which could fall under the category of statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
