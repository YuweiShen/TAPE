The paper specifically focuses on a special subclass of submodular functions that arise in computer vision and machine learning applications, which can be written as the sum of many submodular cost functions defined over cliques containing few variables. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Submodular function minimization is a classic problem in optimization and algorithms, and the paper proposes a novel algorithmic approach to efficiently minimize a special subclass of submodular functions. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions that the special subclass of submodular functions it deals with arises in machine learning applications, and the proposed algorithmic approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in this field. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions that the special subclass of submodular functions it deals with arises in computer vision applications, and the proposed algorithmic approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in this field. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Submodular functions are widely used in artificial intelligence and optimization, and the proposed algorithmic approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in this field. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
