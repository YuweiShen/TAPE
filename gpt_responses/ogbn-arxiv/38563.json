Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of polyhedral abstractions, which is a technique commonly used in optimization and linear programming, suggesting that cs.LO (Optimization and Control) is another likely category. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results based on an implementation of the proposed techniques, which suggests that cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible categories. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of synthesizing linear hybrid systems, which is a topic related to robotics, suggesting that cs.RO (Robotics) is a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
