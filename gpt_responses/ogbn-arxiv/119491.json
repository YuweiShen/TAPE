The use of Bayesian optimisation and machine learning techniques for trajectory optimisation and prior reuse suggests the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with obstacle avoidance and velocity profiling, which are related to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of a simulator and testing on physical robots suggests the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV) for visual perception and tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
