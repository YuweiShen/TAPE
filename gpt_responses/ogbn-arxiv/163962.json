The focus on deterministic environments and sparse rewards suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's analysis of the underlying mechanisms of convergence in actor-critic algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
