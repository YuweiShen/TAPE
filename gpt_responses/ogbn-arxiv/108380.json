The streaming model is a common framework for analyzing algorithms in both areas. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are both likely categories. The paper also uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and combinatorics (cs.DM), which are relevant to submodular maximization. Finally, the paper mentions the use of graph algorithms (cs.CC) in the post-processing step."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
