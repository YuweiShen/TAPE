The study involves human-subject experiments and focuses on delegation situations characterized by uncertainty. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also involves a simulated UAV agent, which suggests a connection to cs.RO (Robotics). The study uses online surveys and examines inferred capability and intention, which are related to AI (Artificial Intelligence) and decision-making. The study also involves collaboration with robots across multiple contexts, which suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
