The paper also deals with the issue of eavesdropping, which is a security concern and falls under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of feedback channels is a key aspect of the proposed scheme, which falls under the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of binary symmetric channels, which is a topic that falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of different configurations for the encoding scheme, which could potentially involve multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
