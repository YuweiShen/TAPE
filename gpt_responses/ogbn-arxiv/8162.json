The use of up-to techniques and the focus on soundness of bisimilarity relations suggest that the paper may also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and type theory (cs.TL). The inclusion of specific calculi such as call-by-value lambda-calculus with delimited-control operators and abortive control operators further supports the relevance to programming languages. Finally, the use of the Coq proof assistant suggests that the paper may also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
