The paper proposes a new learning algorithm that combines naive Bayesian classifier and decision tree, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The algorithm also addresses difficulties in data mining, such as handling continuous attribute and reducing noise in training data, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the limitations of current intrusion detection systems, which is related to system and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
