The paper also discusses the tradeoffs between accuracy, performance, and resource utilization, which is a common concern in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves computer vision techniques for analyzing big data streams, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of static datasets and multi-scan training approaches, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the use of resource utilization, which could also fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
