The use of game-theoretic frameworks suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-category. The investigation of how to influence the behavior of uncontrollable agents through controlled agents involves the use of AI techniques, which could place the paper in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.
