The use of formal axioms to constrain the interpretation of primitives is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The ERA data model and its connection to first-order logic is relevant to database systems (cs.DB) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the compatibility with formal concept analysis, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
