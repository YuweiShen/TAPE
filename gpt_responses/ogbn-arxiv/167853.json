The paper proposes a deep learning approach for this task, which involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large dataset of indoor video segments (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the challenges of this task, such as the need for fine-grained predictions and the lack of explicit depth or velocity information, which are relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the importance of collision avoidance in robotics, which is a topic of interest in the field of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
