The focus on block sparse signals suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), where structured sparsity is often studied. The use of mixed $l_{2}/l_{1}$ minimization for robust recovery suggests that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper's emphasis on exploiting block structure suggests that it may also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SI), where structured sparsity is also studied."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
