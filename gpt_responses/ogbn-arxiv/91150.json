Specifically, the use of visual signatures and distance metrics for classification and recommender systems is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The study of scientific information exchange and how different disciplines use visualization to express ideas is relevant to social informatics (cs.SI) and software engineering (cs.SD). Finally, the consideration of how specific figure types propagate through the literature is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
