The strong converse and upper bound on the reliability function are also concepts in information theory. The technical lemma introduced in the paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of typical sets and state sequences. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) due to the use of coding techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
