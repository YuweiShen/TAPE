The codes are also described as convolutional codes, which are often studied in the networking and communication (cs.NI) community. The paper also discusses the implementation perspective of the codes, which could be of interest to the systems and computer architecture (cs.SI) community. Finally, the paper discusses the size of the minimum stopping set, which is a concept related to combinatorial optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
