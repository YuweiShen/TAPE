This involves the use of neural networks for policy and predictor networks, which are commonly used in robotics and artificial intelligence research (cs.RO, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of supervised and reinforcement learning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of computer vision to analyze the observations and interactions of the robotic agent (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the transfer of the learned model to a different robot arm, which involves the study of system integration and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
