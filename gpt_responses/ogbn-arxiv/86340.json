The focus of the paper is on reducing the memory requirements and energy consumption of these networks, which is a common concern in hardware implementation (cs.AR). The proposed solution involves sparsely-connected networks, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed solution on popular datasets, which is a common practice in neural network research (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
