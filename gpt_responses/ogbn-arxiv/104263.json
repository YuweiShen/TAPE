It discusses the trade-off between accuracy and fairness and proposes a new metric called infra-marginality to evaluate individual-level bias. This topic falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cybersecurity (cs.CR), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes a practical method to measure infra-marginality, which could also fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
