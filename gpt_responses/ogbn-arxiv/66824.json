The use of related families to construct attribute reducts involves techniques of data mining (cs.DM) and database systems (cs.DB). The experimental results also suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling dynamic data, which is a topic related to computational intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
