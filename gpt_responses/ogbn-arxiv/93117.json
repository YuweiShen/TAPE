However, given that the paper focuses on learning an unknown linear system with Gaussian noise, it is most likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of robust optimization to ensure safe exploration, which is a topic that falls under cs.RO (Robotics and Control) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of exploration strategies, which is a topic that falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
