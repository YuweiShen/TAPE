This problem is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network coding (cs.NI), as well as communication complexity (cs.CC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also presents a new formulation for the problem, which involves the use of matrices, suggesting a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
