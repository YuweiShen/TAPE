The paper focuses on constructing a reasonable pooled graph topology and retaining effective graph information, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper uses graph data, which is relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
