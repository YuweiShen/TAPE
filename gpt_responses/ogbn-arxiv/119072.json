The use of genetic algorithms for parameter tweaking and self-play also suggests a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with game theory (cs.GT) and propositional logic (cs.PL) in the context of GGP. Finally, the development of a GGP framework suggests a connection to Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
