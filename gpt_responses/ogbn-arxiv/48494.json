The study also involves the annotation of affective data, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). The investigation of the impact of socio-cultural differences on the annotation and detection of affective states also involves machine learning techniques, which are covered by the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the study involves the analysis of data and the development of models, which are topics covered by the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
