The use of Lipschitz continuous and smooth functions suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant. The mention of PSPACE-hardness and the counting hierarchy suggests that the paper may also be related to complexity theory (cs.DS) and computational complexity in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of polynomial-time computable functions suggests that computational geometry (cs.CG) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
