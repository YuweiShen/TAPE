The proposed method involves the use of functional iteration and Rodrigues vector, which are also commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for attitude estimation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
