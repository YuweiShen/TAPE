The paper also proposes a deep learning-based approach using a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn long-term temporal dependencies across multiple cues. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of tracking objects, which is related to Robotics (cs.RO) and Multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
