The focus on intermittent time-series data and the use of time-frequency patterns suggests a potential fit for information retrieval (cs.IR) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the evaluation of the technique on synthetic and real-world data aligns with the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
