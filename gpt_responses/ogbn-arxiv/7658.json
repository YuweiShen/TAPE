This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed technique can be applied to improve the performance of OFDM-based communication systems, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of a deep neural network (DNN) to manipulate the parameters of a set of functions that yield complementary sequences (CSs) for OFDM-AEs. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The introduced layer admits auxiliary parameters that allow one to control the amplitude and phase deviations in the frequency domain. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): OFDM is a widely used modulation technique in multimedia communication systems, and the proposed technique can be applied to improve the performance of such systems. Hence, this paper can also be categorized under cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
