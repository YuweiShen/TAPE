The use of a deep architecture and training the network in an end-to-end fashion suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The normalization technique introduced in the paper could also make it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of camera intrinsics and recovering the relative pose suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
