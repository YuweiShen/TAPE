The use of data-driven learning and self-supervised paradigms suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The use of sensors and measurement of success/failure suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The focus on grasping and object recognition suggests that it could belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category.
