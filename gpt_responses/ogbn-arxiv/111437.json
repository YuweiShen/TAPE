The paper proposes a novel nonlinear interference alignment technique, which involves breaking up a one-dimensional space into two fractional dimensions, and achieves near-capacity performance for the entire SNR range. This technique is applicable to various wireless communication scenarios, including massive MIMO (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), multimedia communication (cs.MM), and communication engineering (cs.CE). Therefore, these five arXiv CS sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
