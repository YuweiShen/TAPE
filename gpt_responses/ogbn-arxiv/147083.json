The paper also considers the problem in the geometric setting, which suggests that it could be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper discusses approximation algorithms and space complexity, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
