The proposed framework involves the use of dynamic watermarking, which is a technique commonly used in control systems (cs.SY). The algorithm designed for cyber attack detection is based on statistical models, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The framework is practically implementable, which involves software engineering principles (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with the detection of cyber attacks on networked systems, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
