The model uses neural networks to model global properties for nested and overlapping structures and constructs events in a bottom-up manner. This work involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly found in the computer science sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
