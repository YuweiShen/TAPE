This approach is related to the study of dynamical systems. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper mentions that the new algorithm for rational functions of three variables is faster than known algorithms in some examples of combinatorial interest. This suggests a potential connection to computational complexity. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): While the paper does not explicitly discuss logic, the topic of telescopers has connections to the study of recurrence relations, which is a topic in logic and computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
