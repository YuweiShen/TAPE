Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the joint sparsity structure in the user channel matrices, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Machine Learning) or cs.SI (Signal Processing). Additionally, the paper discusses the training and feedback overhead, which could place it in cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
