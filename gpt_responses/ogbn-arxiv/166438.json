This topic is closely related to robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on a specific algorithmic improvement rather than a specific application, cs.RO is the most likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
