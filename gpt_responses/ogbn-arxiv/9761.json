This topic is related to computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with authentication. The approach is also designed to be convenient for users to access smart objects found in indoor environments, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the performance of the approach in the presence of possible interfering sources, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of iBEP sensing is a novel approach and could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
