Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security issues related to ICN, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely category. The deployment of ICN requires an SDN-based network, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the benefits of anycast, multicast, and multi-source forwarding, which are related to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
