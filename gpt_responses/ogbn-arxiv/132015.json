The paper also discusses the optimization of the input covariance matrix and the inflation factor, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also considers the case of multiple antennas, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis and optimization algorithms, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
