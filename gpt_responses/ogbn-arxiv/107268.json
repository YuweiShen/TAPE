This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) such as machine learning and deep learning, natural language processing (cs.CL) for incorporating unsupervised vectors pre-trained on textual resources, and large-scale data processing (cs.DB) for knowledge base completion tasks. The paper also evaluates the performance of different models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
