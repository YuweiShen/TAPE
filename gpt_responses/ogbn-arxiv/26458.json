The paper also involves formalization, transformation, and semantics-preserving techniques, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) the second most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and data structures, which are related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms).
