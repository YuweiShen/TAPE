The paper describes a system called ASPECTOR that computes aspects for a given query, which are sets of search queries that represent distinct information needs relevant to the original search query. This falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.DL, cs.LG) since the system uses clustering and knowledge bases to compute candidate aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
