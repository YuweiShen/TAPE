The method involves finding a region of design space that is insensitive to the inputs, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions using an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the expectation of improvements, which is a common technique in optimisation and search algorithms (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the method on test functions, which is a common practice in data science and machine learning (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
