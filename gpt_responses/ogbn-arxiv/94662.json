The use of determinantal point processes (DPPs) to model diversity suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed feature-aware softmax and encoder-decoder framework also suggest a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CE). Finally, the use of masked beam search and DPP selection for bundle generation suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
