This involves using multimodal features gathered by a companion robot equipped with a Kinect. The paper also draws inspiration from social and cognitive sciences to perform the perception task. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics) followed by cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as the paper deals with developing a method for a robot to interact with humans. The use of a Kinect camera for gathering multimodal features suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also involves investigating meaningful features for recognizing someone's intention of starting an interaction, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
