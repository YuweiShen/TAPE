Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). However, since the paper also addresses the optimization of the true objective and preventing overfitting, it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper proposes a new technique for regularization, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, since the paper uses natural language processing techniques in some of its experiments, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
