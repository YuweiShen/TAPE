This involves image processing and analysis, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of optimal transport, which is a mathematical optimization technique that falls under the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The paper also discusses the computational implementation of the technique, which falls under the computational engineering (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of regularization to improve the accuracy of the technique, which falls under the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
