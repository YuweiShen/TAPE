The paper also discusses pattern mining techniques and their integration with CNN activations, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The evaluation of the proposed approach on scene and object classification tasks also relates to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
