The use of FCNs also involves training and optimization techniques, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the proposed method can be applied to multimedia analysis (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
