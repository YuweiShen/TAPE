This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper formulates a maximum a posteriori detector for arbitrary number and location of outages on trees, which can be considered as an AI-based approach for detecting outages. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework for optimal sensor placement based on the maximum missed detection probability, which involves designing software for efficient use of measurements. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed outage detection framework can have implications for the security of power distribution networks. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the topology detection of power distribution networks, which can be considered as a type of network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
