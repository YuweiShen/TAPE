Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework for training the generator against an ensemble of discriminator networks, which can be seen as a one-student/multiple-teachers setting. This framework involves the use of multiple discriminators, which can be seen as a form of curriculum learning, and is evaluated within the full-information adversarial bandit framework. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
