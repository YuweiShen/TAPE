The approach is based on a second-order lumped-parameter model, which captures the dynamics of synchronous generators and frequency-responsive DERs. This model is related to the originating higher-order dynamical model, which suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) focus. The paper also discusses the design of droop-control parameters, which is related to power systems (cs.PF) and electrical engineering (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper discusses the steady-state and transient performance of the system, which is related to control engineering (cs.CE) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
