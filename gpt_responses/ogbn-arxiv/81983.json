The proposed methods involve attention mechanisms and regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the optimization of the image captioning model, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
