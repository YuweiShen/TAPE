Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of distribution matcher and look-up table, which are related to optimization and algorithms, making cs.OH (Other Computer Science) a possible sub-category. The transmission aspect of the paper suggests that it could also belong to cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of photonics for transmission, which makes cs.PHOTONICS (Photonics and Electro-Optics) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
