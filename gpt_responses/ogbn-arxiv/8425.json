The paper focuses on the downlink beamforming training and its impact on the achievable downlink rate. This topic falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the analysis of communication systems and their capacity limits. Additionally, the paper also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) as it discusses the cooperation between access points. The paper also involves Signal Processing (cs.SI) as it deals with beamforming and channel estimation. Furthermore, the paper also involves Multimedia (cs.MM) as it discusses the transmission of data to multiple users. Finally, the paper also involves Computer Communications (cs.COM) as it discusses the performance evaluation of different methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
