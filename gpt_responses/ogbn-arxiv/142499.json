This involves optimizing the digital and analog precoders, which is a key problem in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with multiuser MIMO and OFDM, which are important topics in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new hybrid precoding structure and an effective hybrid precoding algorithm, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, which is a key technology for multimedia applications such as high-definition video streaming. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a LASSO formulation for the analog precoder, which is a machine learning technique commonly used in natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
