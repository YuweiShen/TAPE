The paper also discusses the limitations of current natural language inference models, which are typically based on machine learning algorithms (cs.AI, cs.LG). The authors analyze linguistic phenomena such as negation and vagueness, which are relevant to natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and text classification (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses large-scale datasets and crowd workers to generate data, which is a common approach in computer vision research (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
