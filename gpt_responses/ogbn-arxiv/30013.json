The paper also discusses the use of cost functions to optimize the error performance, which is related to network optimization (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions simulation results, which suggests the use of multimedia (cs.MM) for visualization and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
