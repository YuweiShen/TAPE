It also introduces a new regularization technique for training low rank factored versions of matrix multiplications. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it specifically focuses on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) and improving the performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this task. \n\nAdditionally, it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as neural networks are commonly used for image recognition tasks that involve dense matrix multiplications. \n\nIt may also fall under cs.SD (Sound) as it deals with speech recognition, which is a subfield of sound processing. \n\nFinally, it could be classified under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it proposes new techniques for training and optimizing neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
