It also uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, which are commonly used in NLP research. \n\nIt could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category because document summarisation is a task related to information retrieval. \n\nThe paper's focus on learning a reward function using Learning-to-Rank (L2R) algorithms suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of RL algorithms also suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on efficient RL algorithms suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
