This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.MA) as the paper investigates controllers that use statistics to manipulate the swarm. The paper also discusses automatic controllers, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of human operators and online games suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) in the research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
