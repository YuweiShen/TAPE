Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of Polyak-\\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, which is a theoretical concept in optimization and is relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
