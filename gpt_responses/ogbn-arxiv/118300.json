This involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG) and computational finance (cs.CE, cs.CR) to improve creditworthiness evaluations. The paper also uses a real-world dataset from a P2P lending marketplace, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
