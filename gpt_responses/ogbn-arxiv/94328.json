This suggests that the paper could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, which deals with the design and control of robots and autonomous systems. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of differential dynamic logic (d$\\mathcal{L}$) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) research. The paper also focuses on cooperative multi-agent systems, which falls under the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a hierarchical design framework, which could be related to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category, as it involves the synthesis of coordination schemes and control policies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
