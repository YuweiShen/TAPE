It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) because it involves visual grounding. Additionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because it involves developing a novel modular network for reasoning. It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) because it involves training the network end-to-end using the Gumbel-Softmax approximation and its straight-through gradient estimator."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
