The use of structured regularisation and maximal bipartite matching to solve the optimisation problem is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the accuracy and efficiency of the resulting models, which are important considerations in neural network (cs.NE) research. Finally, the paper mentions the ease of deployment of the models, which is a topic often discussed in natural language processing (cs.CL) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
