It also involves algorithms and techniques for optimizing caching, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The problem of nonuniform demands is related to network information theory (cs.NI) and system optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a new strategy for coded caching, which is a problem in coding theory (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
