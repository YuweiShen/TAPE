The use of multiple sensors and fusion techniques also involves signal processing and data analysis, which can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the evaluation of classification accuracy can be considered as a form of performance analysis, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
