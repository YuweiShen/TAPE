The approach involves constructing causal models, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The focus is on image classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper also deals with safety-critical domains, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
