Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of routing tables and forwarding loops, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of storage overhead, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
