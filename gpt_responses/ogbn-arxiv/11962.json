The paper also proposes a new architecture and technique for fine-tuning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions natural language processing (cs.CL) as an example of an unseen task for which the proposed techniques can improve generalizability."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
