The paper also discusses the properties of codes used in these constructions, which is relevant to cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical techniques such as Schur product and polynomial rings, which are topics in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
