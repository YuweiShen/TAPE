This problem is relevant in several areas of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and databases (cs.DB). The paper discusses experiments on real-world and synthetic inputs, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the subfield of experimental computer science (cs.XX). However, given the focus on nearest neighbor search and the use of LSH-based techniques, we believe that the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS, cs.IR, cs.CV, cs.LG, and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
