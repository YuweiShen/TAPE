It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with neural networks. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it discusses the theoretical framework and instruments for the development of FFN. The paper also mentions classification tasks, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the mention of eigenvalue spectrum suggests that it could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
