The paper discusses the impact of feedback on the performance of LT codes and analyzes the adaptive mechanism in standard LT codes. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential interference of feedback with the adaptive mechanism, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
