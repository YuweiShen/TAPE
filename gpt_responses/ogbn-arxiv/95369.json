This topic is closely related to formal verification, which is a major area of research in computer science. The paper proposes a new algorithm that is more efficient than existing methods, and can be used to verify B\\\"uchi properties on timed automata. This suggests that the paper could be classified under several arXiv CS sub-categories, such as cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
