The focus on accuracy and multiprecision arithmetic also suggests a numerical analysis perspective. \n- cs.DS (Dynamical Systems): Polynomial homotopy continuation can be viewed as a dynamical system, where the solution path is traced by following the flow of a vector field defined by the homotopy. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): While the paper does not explicitly mention symbolic computation, the use of polynomial equations and multiprecision arithmetic suggests a connection to symbolic computation. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on accuracy and quality up can be seen as a control problem, where the goal is to improve the performance of a system (in this case, the polynomial homotopy solver) by using multiple cores. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper's application to polynomial homotopy continuation suggests a connection to computational science and engineering, where polynomial equations often arise in modeling and simulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
