Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other possible categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as the paper also discusses hyper-parameter tuning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
