The approach is based on contrastive learning, which is a popular technique in unsupervised learning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the semantics of the underlying scene, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the approach is applied to image and video data, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
