The paper discusses the achievable rates in the uplink and downlink, assuming single-cell linear processing and uncorrelated MIMO Rician fading channel matrix. The analysis is conducted assuming that $N$ and $K$ grow large with a given ratio $N/K$, which is a typical assumption in information theory and signal processing. The paper also considers the impact of LoS components, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
