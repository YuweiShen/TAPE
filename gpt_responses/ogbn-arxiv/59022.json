The paper proposes a new angle-based reprojection loss for training a convolutional neural network to regress for pixels in a query image their corresponding 3D world coordinates in the scene. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also involves optimization schemes and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper also mentions the use of multi-view constraints, which are related to sub-category cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
