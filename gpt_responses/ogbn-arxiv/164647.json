Additionally, the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for architecture search suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of MCTS for search and optimization also suggests that it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
