The paper also evaluates the generalizability of the CNNs, which is a common concern in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of radiographs as medical imaging data suggests that the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category may also be relevant. Finally, the paper discusses the potential confounding factors in medical data analysis, which may relate to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
