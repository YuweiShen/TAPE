This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with data representation and clustering. The paper also introduces a non-linear local SSC algorithm and a kernel-based framework, which suggests the possibility of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) being relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of redundancies in sparse coding results and proposes a post-processing step to improve the representation graph, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
