The paper also discusses the limitations of the standard method and proposes an exact method that is correct for any sample size. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.PR (Probability), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MS (Mathematical Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
