The experiments are also performed on image datasets, further supporting this category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of polysemous codes for efficient nearest neighbor search, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The experiments are also performed on text datasets, further supporting this category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of product quantization and binary codes, which are common techniques in machine learning for dimensionality reduction and efficient storage/comparison of high-dimensional data.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the design of polysemous codes, which are a novel data structure for efficient nearest neighbor search. The paper also discusses the use of inverted multi-index, which is a common data structure for approximate nearest neighbor search.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The experiments are performed on multimedia datasets such as image and text datasets, and the paper discusses the use of polysemous codes for efficient search of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
