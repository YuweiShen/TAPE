The specific task of instance search falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of attention models and saliency weighting is a technique that has been explored in multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of off-the-shelf representations, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
