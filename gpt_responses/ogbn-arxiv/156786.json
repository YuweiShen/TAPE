The paper proposes a new method called CASC, which is based on a large optimization problem and a greedy alternating minimization-based approach. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), and possibly also social and information networks (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
