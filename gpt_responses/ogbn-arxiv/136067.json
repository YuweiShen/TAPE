The paper also discusses the issue of storing a large distributed ledger, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and database systems (cs.DB). The proposed solution involves the use of oblivious random access memory (ORAM), which is a data structure commonly used in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a design that leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs), which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
