The paper also mentions the use of Word or Para2Vec, which are natural language processing techniques, indicating that it could also belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach that estimates semantic relevance scores, which involves machine learning techniques such as similarity estimation and ranking, suggesting that it could also belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses experimental results to evaluate the proposed approach, which involves data analysis and statistical methods, indicating that it could also belong to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
