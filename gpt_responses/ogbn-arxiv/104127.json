The paper deals with natural language processing and deep learning, which are both covered by the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. The use of neural networks and optimization techniques suggests the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category as well. The paper also involves the interpretation of internal representations, which falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of Tensor Product Representations and attention mechanisms suggests the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
