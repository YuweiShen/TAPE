The paper also discusses the interpretability of anomalies, which is a topic that is relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) community. Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach for anomaly description, which involves identifying subspaces and feature rules, which is a topic that is relevant to the database (cs.DB) community. Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting anomalies, which is a topic that is relevant to the cryptography (cs.CR) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
