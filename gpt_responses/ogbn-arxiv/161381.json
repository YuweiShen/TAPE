The paper specifically focuses on the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for remote inference, which suggests the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The case studies mentioned in the paper involve tasks such as spoken digit recognition, handwritten digit recognition, and sign language recognition, which suggest the categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper also mentions the limited compute power of edge devices, which suggests the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
