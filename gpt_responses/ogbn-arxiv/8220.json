The paper also introduces a character attention mechanism and uses RNNs for word recognition, which are techniques commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the optimization difficulties in training the two tasks in a unified framework, which is a problem in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel text-alignment layer, which involves geometric transformations, a topic in computer graphics (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the model on two datasets, which is a problem in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
