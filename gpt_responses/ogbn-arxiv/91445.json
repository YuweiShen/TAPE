The paper also establishes relations between codes over different rings, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of cyclic codes is also relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper considers the GC content constraint, which is a topic in computational biology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
