It also addresses the scalability issue in leader election, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper proposes a protocol that provides game-theoretic guarantees, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT). The use of blockchain also involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and the incentivization aspect relates to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
