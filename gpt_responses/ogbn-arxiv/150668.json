The use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also deals with semantic representations, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which could place it in the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category.
