The use of neural networks and attention mechanisms also suggests a possible fit with machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of the proposed method to video animation and view synthesis suggests a possible fit with multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
