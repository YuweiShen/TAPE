This is a topic related to computational geometry. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with the problem of deciding whether a given signed graph has a drawing in a given Euclidean space, which is a topic related to game theory and computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
