The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method and compares it with other compression techniques. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): DNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, and compressing them is crucial for deploying them on resource-constrained platforms. The paper focuses on compressing DNNs and optimizing the accuracy/model-size trade-off. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for optimizing the compression of DNNs, which is a crucial aspect of deploying AI models on resource-constrained platforms. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses customized operations inspired by genetic algorithms to adaptively sample the hyperparameter space for compressing DNNs. This approach is related to evolutionary computing, which is a subfield of neural computing. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper focuses on compressing DNNs for accelerated inference on resource-constrained platforms, which is a systems and control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
