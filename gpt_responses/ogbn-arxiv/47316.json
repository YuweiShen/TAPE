It also involves data structures and algorithms for nearest neighbor search (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.AI) since kNN is a common technique in these fields. Finally, the paper discusses memory-resident implementations, which falls under systems and architecture (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
