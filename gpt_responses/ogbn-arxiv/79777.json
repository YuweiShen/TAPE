This involves computer vision techniques such as image and video processing, which falls under the scope of cs.CV.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The proposed system aims to improve security in places where human behavior can be unpredictable, such as prisons and public protests. This involves designing a system that can interact with humans in a way that is effective and non-intrusive, which falls under the scope of cs.HC.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes using multiple modalities (facial expression, head, hand and body movement, speech) for detecting anger and aggressive actions. This involves processing and analyzing multimedia data, which falls under the scope of cs.MM.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes using support vector machines and rule-based features for recognizing aggressive behavior. This involves using machine learning and AI techniques, which falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes using support vector machines for recognizing aggressive behavior. This involves using machine learning techniques, which falls under the scope of cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
