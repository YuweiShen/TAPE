Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions techniques developed to prove the theorems, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The use of probabilistic methods in the proofs could also relate to cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper's discussion of the implications of the theorems for computing approximate solutions could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
