The paper proposes a new algorithm for deterministic selection, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the field of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AL). The paper also presents experimental results on random and normally-distributed inputs, which suggests that the algorithm may be of interest to researchers in the field of computational complexity (cs.CC) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper uses the concept of MedianOfMedians, which is a well-known technique in the field of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
