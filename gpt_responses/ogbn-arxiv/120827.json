The use of multivariate mutual information and total correlation is a common technique in information theory, which is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
