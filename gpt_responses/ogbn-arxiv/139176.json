Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces iterative algorithms for efficient reconstruction, which falls under the category of machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses theoretical recovery guarantees and numerical simulations, which involve mathematical analysis and numerical computations, respectively, making cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
