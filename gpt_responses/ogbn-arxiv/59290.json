The paper also proposes different measures to capture the quality of plan sets, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses heuristic approaches to find sets of plans, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed approach in real-world planning scenarios, which involves systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
