The paper also discusses applications of the derived bounds in nonlinear learning compression and inference. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
