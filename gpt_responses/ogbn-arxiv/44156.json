The proposed method, Multi-way BP, is a novel approach to address this issue and can be applied to various deep architectures, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of auxiliary losses, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
