The paper uses pose estimation algorithms and machine learning techniques to extract features from movement trajectories of individual joints. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper uses machine learning techniques such as random forests to detect and estimate the severity of parkinsonism and LID, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the potential clinical application of the proposed system, which could fall under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of computer vision for automated assessment of PD symptoms could also have implications for robotics and automation, which could place the paper under cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper uses deep learning algorithms, which could also place it under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
