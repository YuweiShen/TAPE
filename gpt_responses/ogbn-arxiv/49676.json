The paper also discusses the optimization process and the need for numerical stability, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper introduces an approach to training deep networks that depends on the eigenvector corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network, which suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses keypoint matching and 3D pose estimation, which suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with incorporating known notions of geometry into deep learning frameworks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
