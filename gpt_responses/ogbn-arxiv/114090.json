This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the analysis of communication systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of the bit mapper that determines the allocation of the coded bits to the modulation bits of the signal constellation, which falls under the category of computer communications (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of coded modulation setups with higher-order signal constellations, which could fall under the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of various types of GPCs, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.COM) as it deals with the complexity of decoding algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
