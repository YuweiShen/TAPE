The study focuses on analyzing the relations among the operator's head, hand, and operation location, which are all visual cues. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The study aims to understand how novice operators perceive the operational environment and formulate knowledge to deal with various operation situations. The findings can be used to design better human-machine interfaces for machine operation tasks. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The study involves analyzing the operator's behaviors during a machine operation task, which can be useful for designing robots that can perform similar tasks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper examines important features of operational behaviors in different skill level operators and confirms their correlation to the difficulties of the operation steps. Machine learning techniques can be used to model and predict the operator's behavior based on these features. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The findings of the study can be used to develop intelligent systems that can assist novice operators in machine operation tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
