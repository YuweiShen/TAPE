Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication systems. The paper also discusses the impact of the encoding techniques on the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM symbols, which is a key issue in communication systems. This suggests that cs.COMM (Communications) is another likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a framework for encoding complementary sequences (CSs), which can be used for frequency diversity and coding gain in communication systems. This suggests that cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of CSs with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) alphabet, which is a common modulation scheme in communication systems. This suggests that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
