Additionally, the implementation of sensorial fusion and decision making in the fungal electronics could also be considered a robotics-related task.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The development of a mycelium-based electronics involves the use of computational methods to functionalize the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers. This could fall under the scope of computational engineering.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of sensorial fusion and decision making in the fungal electronics could involve the processing and analysis of multimedia data, such as images and sounds.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The natural adaptation of the fungal buildings to the environment could be seen as a form of evolutionary computing. Additionally, the implementation of decision making in the fungal electronics could involve the use of neural networks.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed approach involves the development of a self-growing and self-repairing system for building construction, which could fall under the scope of systems and control. Additionally, the implementation of sensorial fusion and decision making in the fungal electronics could involve the use of control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
