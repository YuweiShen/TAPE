This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a student-teacher framework for training the networks, which involves regression and uncertainty estimation, indicating the use of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of discriminative latent embeddings, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on real-world datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
