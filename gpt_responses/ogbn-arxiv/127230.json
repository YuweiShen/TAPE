The focus is on Microsoft OneDrive and online maps, and the paper demonstrates how short-URL enumeration can be used to access shared content and sensitive information. This makes cs.CR the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of cloud services that encourage and support collaboration, and the integration of URL shorteners to help users share links to online documents, maps, etc. The paper also highlights the unintended consequences of this design decision, which leads to serious security and privacy vulnerabilities. This makes cs.SE a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the privacy implications of short URLs in cloud services, and how they can be used to access sensitive information about individuals. The paper also highlights the potential for large-scale, automated malware injection through cloud-stored files. This makes cs.CY a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the design and implementation of cloud services that encourage and support collaboration, and the unintended consequences of this design decision, which leads to serious"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
