The focus is on representation learning algorithms over symbolized sequences, which is a common topic in the machine learning subfield of natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition (CL). The end-to-end training approach and use of deep neural networks suggest a focus on machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). The use of deep learning for classification tasks also suggests a focus on computer vision (CV) and neural networks (NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
