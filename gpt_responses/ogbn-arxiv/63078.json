It also involves the use of temporal logic, which is a common tool in the field of formal methods (cs.SE) for specifying and verifying system behavior. Additionally, the paper focuses on controlling physical systems (cs.RO) and incorporates control barrier functions, which are commonly used in control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves developing a flexible and learnable system for specifying task objectives and constraints, which is a common theme in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
