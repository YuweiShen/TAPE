This is a classic problem in information theory and hence this category is the most likely fit.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of the symmetric alpha stable noise distribution which is known to accurately capture network interference. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the networking and internet architecture community.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper may be relevant to the social and information networks community as it deals with the performance of space-time coding over fading channels which is a common problem in wireless networks.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper may be relevant to the multimedia community as space-time coding is often used in multimedia applications such as video streaming.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a maximum-likelihood receiver and its approximation at high signal-to-noise ratio which may be of interest to the computational engineering community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
