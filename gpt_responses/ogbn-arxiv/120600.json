Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DB (Databases), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper mentions CountMin and CountSketch data structures, which are commonly used in the field of sketching and streaming algorithms, suggesting that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the optimality of the proposed algorithms, which may fall under the scope of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
