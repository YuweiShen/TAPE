This makes cs.DM a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper discusses the rigidity of networks, which is a topic closely related to computational geometry. Additionally, the paper mentions the Henneberg construction, which is a well-known algorithm in computational geometry for constructing graphs. Hence, cs.CG is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the construction of networks, which is a topic that falls under the purview of cs.SI. Additionally, the paper discusses the properties of networks, such as bearing rigidity, which is a relevant topic in social and information networks.\n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the rigidity of networks, which is a topic that can be analyzed using numerical methods. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of linear algebraic techniques to prove the main result. Hence, cs.NA is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the construction of graphs, which is a topic that falls under the purview of cs.DS.
