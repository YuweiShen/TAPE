The framework involves an end-to-end trainable network for imitating the expert demonstrator's driving commands and intermediately predicting visual affordances and action primitives through direct supervision. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a multi-task learning framework for autonomous driving, which involves an end-to-end trainable network. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves predicting visual affordances and action primitives through direct supervision, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for autonomous driving using multi-task learning from demonstration, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper involves learning to drive autonomously in urban settings, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics sub-category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves learning to drive autonomously in stochastic urban settings, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Systems and Control sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
