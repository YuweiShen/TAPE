The proposed approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction (cs.CV) and a proximity graph for vocabulary construction (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of binary hash codes for memory efficiency (cs.AI) and the need for real-time performance (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
