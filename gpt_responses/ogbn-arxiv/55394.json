This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses constructing networks from a knowledge base, which is a common topic in the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. The paper also discusses conditions that guarantee query completeness, which is a topic in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category.
