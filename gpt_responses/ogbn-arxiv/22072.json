This falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves the analysis of structured progressions in the reduction process, which could be related to topics in cryptography (cs.CR) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of query lengths and their monotonicity suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
