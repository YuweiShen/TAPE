Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a novel framework that utilizes view-specific networks and cross-view constraints, which involves learning and optimization techniques (LG) and multimedia (MM) processing. The paper also discusses the use of center loss, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI) for improving classification accuracy. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several benchmarks, which involves information retrieval (IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
