The use of continuous amortization to compute complexity bounds for these algorithms is a novel technique in numerical analysis, making this category the most likely fit for this paper.\n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a technique for computing the complexity of algorithms, which is a core topic in data structures and algorithms. The use of continuous amortization to achieve optimal complexity bounds is also a key aspect of this category.\n\n3. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): Root isolation algorithms are commonly used in symbolic computation, and the paper presents complexity bounds for several such algorithms. The use of continuous amortization to compute these bounds is also relevant to this category.\n\n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper extends the technique of continuous amortization to higher dimensions, which is relevant to computational geometry.
