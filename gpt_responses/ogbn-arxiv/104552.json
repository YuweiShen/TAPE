This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY) categories. The paper also discusses the effect of network size and energy availability level, which are relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) category. Additionally, the paper compares the proposed approach to a state-of-the-art distributed source coding system, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
