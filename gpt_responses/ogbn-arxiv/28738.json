The paper also discusses the construction of a decision theory for such calculi, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the practical applications of the transformations, which could be relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
