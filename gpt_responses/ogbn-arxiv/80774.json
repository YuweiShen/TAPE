This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The switch distributions used in the paper are mixtures of adaptive Markov chains, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning. Additionally, the paper deals with analyzing the non-Markovian nature of text, which is a topic of interest in natural language processing.\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper deals with analyzing the properties of natural language text and introduces new codes to test Hilberg's conjecture. This falls under the domain of computation and language.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper introduces new universal codes, which are a type of data structure used for compression.
