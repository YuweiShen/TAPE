The use of a Receding Horizon Planner (RHP) and the need to address the problem of finding a suitable value function based heuristic for efficient planning suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of reinforcement learning to optimize the value function further supports the inclusion of the paper in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world tasks of manipulation in clutter suggest that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
