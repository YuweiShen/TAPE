The proposed approach uses a deep neural network, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of LiDAR and camera sensors, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) for tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
