The methodology involves conducting questionnaires in a computer-mediated way while recording participants with modern RGBD sensors. The paper uses state of the art facial expression analysis based on Dynamic Deep Learning and 3D analysis of behaviour. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which suggest that cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves AI-based techniques for diagnostic predictions, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of modern RGBD sensors for data collection and analysis, which suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
