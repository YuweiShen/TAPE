The use of BERT and attention mechanisms also suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. Additionally, the use of multilayer perceptrons and bidirectional transformers suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) categories.
