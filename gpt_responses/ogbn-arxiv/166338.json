The authors also propose a novel locally-bounded deformation energy, which involves optimization techniques (cs.LG) and machine learning (cs.AI) to learn the stiffness bounds. Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach on cats and horses, which involves 3D modeling and animation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
