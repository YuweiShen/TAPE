The paper also proposes an algorithm for solving the non-convex optimization problem, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of approximation techniques to balance optimality and convergence time, which is relevant to the Mathematical Optimization (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
