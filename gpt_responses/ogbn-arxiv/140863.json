The paper presents a randomized algorithm for this problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this sub-category. \n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The problem of topological ordering is a well-studied problem in discrete mathematics. The paper presents an algorithm for maintaining a topological ordering in an incremental setting, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this sub-category. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The problem of cycle detection is related to the concept of negative cycles in game theory. The paper presents an algorithm for detecting cycles in an incremental setting, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this sub-category. \n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The problem of topological ordering is related to the concept of planar graphs in computational geometry. The paper presents an algorithm for maintaining a topological ordering in an incremental setting, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this sub-category. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - While this sub-category may not seem immediately relevant, the problem of cycle detection is related to the concept of feedback loops in neural networks.
