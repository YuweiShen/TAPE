This involves integrating local features with their corresponding global dependencies and highlighting interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. The paper also evaluates the proposed model in the context of abdominal organ segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
