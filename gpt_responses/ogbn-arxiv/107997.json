Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to improve the interpretability and stability of word embeddings. This technique is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis, which suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper explores the meaning of components in publicly available models for the Russian language, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of orthogonal transformations to modify word embeddings, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and optimization algorithms. This suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
