The paper also involves combinatorial aspects, such as the characterization of transducts of spiralling sequences and their degrees, which suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of degrees of infinite sequences is closely related to computability theory and logic, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.LO and cs.CC. Finally, the paper uses techniques from information theory, such as the notion of polynomial sequences, which suggests a connection to cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
