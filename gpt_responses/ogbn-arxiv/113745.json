Additionally, the use of deep learning for feature extraction suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The integration of deep neural networks also suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of publicly available datasets and analysis of tracking performance suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
