This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also introduces three variants of squeeze & excitation (SE) modules for image segmentation, which involves optimizing network parameters, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluations are performed on two challenging applications, whole brain segmentation on MRI scans and organ segmentation on whole body contrast enhanced CT scans, which fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
