The paper proposes a meta-learning approach to Few Shot Link-Prediction, which is a challenging task representative of real-world data with evolving sub-graphs or entirely new graphs with shared structure. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
