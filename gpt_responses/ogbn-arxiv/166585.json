The paper focuses on comparing two types of frameworks for constructing nonparallel hyperplanes and proposes a new method for multiclass classification. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
