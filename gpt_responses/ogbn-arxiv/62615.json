The paper specifically focuses on the Mean Normalized Citation Score (MNCS) and other size-independent indicators, which are commonly used in computer science research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper proposes recommendations for the scientometric community to switch to ranking by research efficiency, which is relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
