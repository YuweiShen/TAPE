It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as event cameras are commonly used in robotics applications. The use of deep learning techniques suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the algorithm on real-world sequences suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
