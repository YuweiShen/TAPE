This falls under the domain of information theory (IT) and network information theory (NI), which are concerned with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. The paper also discusses the joint optimization of downlink precoding and quantization, which involves the design of communication systems (COMM) that can efficiently transmit information over wireless channels. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed techniques over standard cellular models, which involves the simulation and modeling of complex systems (SY) such as wireless networks. Finally, the paper proposes a practical symbol-by-symbol fronthaul quantization algorithm, which involves the development of algorithms and computational methods (MM) for processing and analyzing data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
