The three communication models considered in the paper, UDG, SNR, and MISO, are all related to information theory (cs.IT). The Expanding Disk Broadcasting Algorithm used in the SNR and MISO models involves a distributed algorithmic approach, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The MISO model also involves cooperation among nodes, which is a topic in the field of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper provides asymptotic bounds and probabilistic analysis, which are techniques commonly used in theoretical computer science (cs.ITP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
