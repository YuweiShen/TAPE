This involves stochastic approximations and regularization to promote smoothness. These topics are closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
