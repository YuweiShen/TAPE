The paper introduces a new concept, the meta distribution of the SIR, which provides fine-grained information on the success probabilities of individual links. This topic falls under the broad category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper involves stochastic processes (cs.SI), mathematical analysis (cs.MA), and probability theory (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
