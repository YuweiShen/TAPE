The paper also discusses the effect of network connectivity on the expressive capacity of neural networks, which is a common topic in the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper specifically analyzes the effect of overlapping architectures in convolutional neural networks, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the theoretical analysis of neural networks, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of network connectivity on system control, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
