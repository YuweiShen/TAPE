The focus on containers as a solution suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the mention of GPU accelerators and specialized networking indicates a potential connection to distributed systems (cs.Distributed)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
