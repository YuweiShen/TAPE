Additionally, the paper deals with autonomous driving, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The proposed method involves the use of a CNN framework, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on two popular datasets in computer vision, which are commonly used in computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
