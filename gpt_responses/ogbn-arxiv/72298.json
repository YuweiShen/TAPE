The use of sequence to sequence algorithms suggests a focus on natural language processing, which is covered by sub-categories such as cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of neural networks also suggests a focus on machine learning, which is covered by sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision).
