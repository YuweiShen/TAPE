The paper also involves analyzing the width of these drawings, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The authors use techniques from graph theory (cs.GT) to prove their results. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.SI) as it involves analyzing the complexity of representing binary trees."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
