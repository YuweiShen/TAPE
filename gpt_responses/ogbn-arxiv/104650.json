This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new type of annotations to identify functions which never cooperate, and introduces CoroCheck, a tool for the static analysis and inference of cooperation annotations. This falls under the domain of software engineering.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the application of the CPC translator to QEMU, an open-source machine emulator which also uses annotated coroutine functions for concurrency. This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of coroutines and events as abstractions for writing concurrent programs, which falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the performance of the translated code with existing implementations of coroutines in QEMU, which falls under the domain of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
