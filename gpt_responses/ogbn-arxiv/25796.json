The use of deep neural networks (cs.LG) and Bayesian optimization (cs.AI) also suggest these sub-categories as likely candidates. Additionally, the use of spatio-temporal information (cs.MM) and the modeling of a dynamic objective function (cs.NE) further support these sub-categories as possible matches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
