The paper introduces a batch version of sparse recovery, which is a natural extension of the classical sparse recovery problem. The paper also leverages the assumption of average sparsity, which is a common assumption in many applications. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
