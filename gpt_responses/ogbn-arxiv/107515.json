The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for end-to-end training suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The integration of global contextual cues such as objects and places suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of the effects of context granularity and spatial resolution, which suggests that it may also belong to the subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
