The model uses deep learning techniques, such as full convolution network (FCN) and pyramid pooling, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces an alignment-free matching approach, which involves measuring similarities between two persons based on their spatial pyramid features, without requiring explicit alignment. This approach is related to similarity learning (cs.AI) and pattern recognition (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
