This falls under the scope of neural computing and hence, cs.NE is the most likely category.\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper deals with solving differential equations, which is a common problem in computational engineering and science. Hence, cs.CE is also a likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses deep reinforcement learning to solve differential equations, which is a subfield of machine learning. Hence, cs.LG is also a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with solving differential equations, which is a common problem in systems and control. Hence, cs.SY is also a likely category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a novel approach for solving differential equations using deep reinforcement learning, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.
