Additionally, it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with the training of neural networks. Furthermore, it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks. It could also be classified under cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) as approximate computing is an emerging technology. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as the use of approximate multipliers can enhance the speed and power efficiency of CNN training, which is relevant to distributed and parallel computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
