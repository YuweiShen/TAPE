Additionally, the paper proposes stochastic approximation algorithms for this purpose. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as neural networks are a popular tool in AI research. \n\nFurthermore, the paper's focus on training neural networks could place it in the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision), as neural networks are commonly used in image recognition and other computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper's use of first-order gradient information suggests it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with optimization techniques for neural networks. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on large minibatches could place it in the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as it deals with the optimization of large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
