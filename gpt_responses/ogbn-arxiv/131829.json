This involves handling large volumes of data and storing/querying them efficiently, which falls under the purview of database systems.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper employs probabilistic models and statistical theory to capture and quantify uncertainty in data streams, which is a common approach in machine learning.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses techniques for efficiently computing result distributions at stream speed, which involves designing and implementing algorithms and data structures for high-volume stream processing.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents the design and development of a data stream system, which involves software engineering principles and practices for building scalable and reliable systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the application of the proposed system in hazardous weather monitoring and object tracking and monitoring, which involves control and monitoring of physical systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
