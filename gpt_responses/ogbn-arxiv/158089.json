This involves learning from a standard scientific categorization and a sample of topic tagged articles to find semantically relevant articles and enrich its metadata accordingly. The paper focuses on improving information retrieval in scientific digital libraries, which is a common topic in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-categories. The use of semantic-based tagging and machine learning techniques also suggests a connection to Natural Language Processing (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
