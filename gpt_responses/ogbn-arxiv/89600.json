The approach is designed to improve the efficiency of distributed computing (cs.DC) and uses graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the approach is designed to learn generalizable placement policies that can be applied to any graph, which involves system-level considerations (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
