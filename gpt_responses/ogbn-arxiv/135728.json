The paper also uses vector-based semantic spaces, which are commonly used in machine learning and data mining (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses the time-stamped Google Books corpus, which is a large-scale dataset commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms to predict compositionality ratings, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with changes in compositionality over time, which is a topic related to computational creativity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
