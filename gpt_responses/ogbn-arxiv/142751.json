Given that the paper focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to non-neural network classifiers, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG), followed by computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
