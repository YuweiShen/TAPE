It also involves the use of neural networks (cs.LG) for self-supervised learning and discriminative feature learning. The use of unlabelled data for generating a synthetic dataset for training the model suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve the use of magnetic resonance images, which suggests the involvement of neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the use of medical images suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
