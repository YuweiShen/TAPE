The paper also focuses on the performance and validation of these networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and data management (cs.DB). The use of synthetic datasets and structure learning algorithms suggests a focus on computational methods (cs.CY) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
