The paper also discusses the impact of centralized and distributed deployments of LIS, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The concept of LIS is also related to massive MIMO (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves the use of intelligent surfaces to improve wireless communication and positioning performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
