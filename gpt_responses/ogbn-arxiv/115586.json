This falls under the broad category of machine learning and specifically deep learning. The paper also mentions the use of sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition, indicating a possible connection to the sub-categories of cs.CL and cs.NE.
