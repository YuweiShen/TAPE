The paper also discusses a technique for improving the scalability of multi-agent learning, which involves sharing experiences between agents. This could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or distributed computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper mentions a supervisor-directed transfer technique, which suggests a control systems (cs.SY) aspect to the work. Finally, the paper specifically focuses on applying the technique to a task allocation problem, which is a common topic in multi-agent systems research (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
