The use of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and fixed-point methods suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). The optimization of the generator for FPGA devices indicates a focus on hardware design, which could place the paper in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
