The paper proposes a new recursive construction for coded caching schemes, which involves designing algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between rate and packet number, which is a topic related to optimization and scheduling (cs.SI). Finally, the paper compares its results with previously known schemes, which involves analyzing and evaluating algorithms (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
