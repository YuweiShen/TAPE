The use of semi-definite programming algorithms and the Positivstellensatz algebraic proof system suggest that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of large deviation inequalities and random matrices suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
