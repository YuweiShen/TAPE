The paper also proposes a new framework for discovering subgoals in reinforcement learning, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image processing and computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed framework in large state spaces, which involves the use of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
