The paper proposes a new loss term that is aware of the higher-order topological features of linear structures, which suggests that it belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a refinement pipeline that iteratively applies the same model over the previous delineation to refine the predictions at each step while keeping the number of parameters and the complexity of the model constant, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper shows that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of data, from microscopy to aerial images, which suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
