This topic falls under the category of computer networks and communications (cs.NI). The paper also proposes an optimal placement algorithm that utilizes an exhaustive search (ES) and a low-complexity algorithm, which involves optimization techniques. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of robotics (cs.RO), information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
