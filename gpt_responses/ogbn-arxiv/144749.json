The use of agent-based hierarchical architecture and IoT technology also suggests a systems and control perspective.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed market-based approach for demand-side management involves the use of smart contracts and transactions between various actors, which can be seen as an application of AI techniques in energy management.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the integration of pro-sumers (consumers who also produce energy) and the need for collaboration between various market actors, which can be seen as a social and ethical issue in the context of energy management.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes the use of Virtual Distribution Grids (VDG) over a common physical infrastructure, which involves distributed computing and communication among various resources and actors.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes the use of blockchain-based generic platform for seamless transacting of smart contracts, which involves software engineering aspects such as design, implementation, and testing of the platform."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
