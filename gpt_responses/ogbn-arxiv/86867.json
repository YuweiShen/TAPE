The paper also uses tools from information theory (cs.IT) to quantify the diversity gain. The concept of proactive resource allocation involves predicting user behavior and balancing traffic over time, which can be seen as a control system (cs.SY) problem. The paper also discusses multicasting (cs.MM) and the cognitive networking scenario (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
