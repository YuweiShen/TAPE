The paper specifically addresses the challenges of parameter overhead and implementation difficulty, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also focuses on improving the accuracy of image classification tasks, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper proposes a general framework for ensemble-based Bayesian neural networks, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
