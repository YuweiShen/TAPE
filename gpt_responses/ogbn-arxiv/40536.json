This task is closely related to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are covered by the cs.CL and cs.IR sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel method that uses hashing to reduce memory cost, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and data mining, covered by the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning models like BERT, which is a popular model in the cs.AI sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on three popular answer selection datasets, which involves text classification and NLP tasks, covered by the cs.CV sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
