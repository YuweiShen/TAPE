The paper proposes a novel unsupervised paradigm for semantic representation of knowledge graph, which involves a two-level hierarchical generative process. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
