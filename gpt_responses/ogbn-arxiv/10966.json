Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper deals with machine learning techniques such as active learning, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The NLP tasks mentioned in the paper, text classification and sequence tagging, are also relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
