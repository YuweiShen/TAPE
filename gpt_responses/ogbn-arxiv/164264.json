The use of massive amounts of unlabeled and noisy Web images for training also suggests a focus on semi-supervised learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses data biases and reranking techniques, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the evaluation of learned representations on public datasets suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
