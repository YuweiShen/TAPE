The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the media forensic field also suggests the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also discusses the problem of determining forgery localization, which is related to image retrieval (cs.IR) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
