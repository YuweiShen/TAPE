Therefore, cs.DC is the most likely sub-category. The paper specifically focuses on deep learning models, which suggests that it could also fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the effects of system architecture on performance, which could place it under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as well. Finally, the paper deals with distributed training architectures/frameworks, which could also place it under cs.Distributed and Parallel Computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
