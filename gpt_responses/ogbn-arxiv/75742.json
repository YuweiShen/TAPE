This involves the use of compressive sensing techniques, which are typically studied in the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the recoverability of targets, which is a problem in the area of machine learning and optimization, and falls under the sub-category of Learning (cs.LG). The use of MIMO radar systems is also relevant to the sub-categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
