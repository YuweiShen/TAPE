The paper also mentions the use of linear classifiers in embedded systems and mobile devices, which could fall under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics). The analysis of the sparsity of feature weights in linear classifiers could be related to the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), as feature selection is a common technique in image processing. Finally, the use of robust optimization techniques could be related to the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as optimization algorithms are a fundamental part of this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
