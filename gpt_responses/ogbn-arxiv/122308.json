Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication systems. The paper also discusses hardware implementation, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper involves simulations, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
