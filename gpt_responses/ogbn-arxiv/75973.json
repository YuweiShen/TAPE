The integration of a systems theory based safety analysis technique also suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) category. The challenges and optimizations related to communication, planning, and requirements also indicate a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category. Finally, the focus on safety-critical systems and the need for empirical knowledge suggests a cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
