The use of log-polar sampling scheme and oversampling/undersampling techniques also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the mention of state-of-the-art results on different datasets suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
