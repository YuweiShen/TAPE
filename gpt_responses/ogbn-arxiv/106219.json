The proposed technique of DropWeight for pruning redundant connections in the CNN architecture is a form of network compression, which is also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of global pooling for building compact systems, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
