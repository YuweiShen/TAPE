The use of the Curry-Howard isomorphism and algebraic datatypes also suggests a focus on programming language theory.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions the use of automated theorem proving and logical conjunction, which are topics within logic in computer science.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper is concerned with generating complete, general-purpose programs from specifications, which is a software engineering problem.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of constraint solving and theorem proving techniques are common in artificial intelligence research.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the use of products, which are a type of formal language construct."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
