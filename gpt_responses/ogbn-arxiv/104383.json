This falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses different approaches to managing coordination problems, which involves decision-making and planning, falling under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses challenges that need to be addressed before autonomous vehicles can safely hit the streets, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) and safety-critical systems (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
