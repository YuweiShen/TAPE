This involves analyzing the information capacity of the system, which falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper investigates the performance of two options (fallback and relay) in mmWave wireless networks, which involves analyzing the network architecture and protocols. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mmWave communications to support extremely high data rate services, which is related to multimedia applications. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a criterion to decide which option should be taken under which network condition, which involves designing a control system to optimize network performance. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the design and deployment of future wireless networks, which could impact society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
