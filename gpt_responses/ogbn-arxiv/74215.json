The proposed method involves using sub peak suppression to improve the response map, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models and optimization techniques, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the proposed method to robotics and autonomous systems is also mentioned, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper includes experimental results and comparisons with other tracking methods, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
