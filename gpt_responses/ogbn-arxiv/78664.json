The paper also discusses the communication overhead and computational cost, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC). The proposed method is specifically tested on convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in various scenarios, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
