The use of a new activation function and modified gated recurrent unit also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with data analysis and classification, which could also fit under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
