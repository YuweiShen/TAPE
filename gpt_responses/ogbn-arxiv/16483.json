This falls under the scope of robotics, specifically in the area of autonomous vehicles.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential benefits of reducing energy consumption and pollutant emissions through the use of connected and automated vehicles. This falls under the scope of computers and society, specifically in the area of sustainable transportation.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a cooperative algorithm for coordinating the maneuvers of connected and automated vehicles at signalized intersections. This falls under the scope of systems and control, specifically in the area of traffic control systems.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper utilizes Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information to allow connected and automated vehicles to approach and depart from signalized intersections in an energy-efficient manner. This falls under the scope of information theory, specifically in the area of communication systems.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, the proposed cooperative algorithm may involve machine learning techniques for optimizing the intra-cluster sequence and cluster formation control. This falls under the scope of machine learning, specifically in the area of reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
