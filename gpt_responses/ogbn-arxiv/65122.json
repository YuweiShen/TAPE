The use of prioritized random linear coding (PRLC) and simultaneous transmission of data blocks suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI). The use of Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning approaches suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of an illustrative example for scalable video transmission suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
