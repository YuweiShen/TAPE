Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel feature fusion strategy, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also evaluates the proposed method's performance, which involves statistical analysis, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category.
