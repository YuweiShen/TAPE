This falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The use of distance functions and metric spaces also suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of words and numbers for representing domain vectors suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
