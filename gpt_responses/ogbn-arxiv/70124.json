The paper also mentions instantiations of the TTDF under the DDH and LWE assumptions, which are topics related to computational complexity and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
