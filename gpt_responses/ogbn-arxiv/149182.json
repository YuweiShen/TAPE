The paper focuses on the use of random feature maps, which have been shown to be effective in speeding up kernel-based methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions the use of the proposed technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications, which are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
