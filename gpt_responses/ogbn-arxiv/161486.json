The proposed method involves auto-tuning of the controller parameter using an optimal approach, which can be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The examples discussed in the paper involve robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
