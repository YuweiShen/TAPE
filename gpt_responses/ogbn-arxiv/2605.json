It also uses concepts from the traditional adaptive filter domain to provide insight into the dynamics and inner workings of BatchNorm. Additionally, it may belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks. It could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as these sub-categories are related to machine learning and neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
