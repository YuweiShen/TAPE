The use of discriminative correlation filters (DCF) is a popular approach for object tracking, which suggests that the paper is likely to be in the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces new concepts and algorithms for improving the DCF tracking, which suggests that it may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its method on standard datasets for object tracking, which suggests that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
