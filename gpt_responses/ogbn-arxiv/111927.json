The paper also mentions the use of universal value function approximators and hindsight experience replay, which are both techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The integration of symbolic action planning and reinforcement learning involves breaking down complex problems into simpler high-level actions, which is related to the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also mentions object manipulation problems, which can involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
