This involves analyzing the outage probability of each user, formulating an average power minimization problem, and solving it using a successive convex approximation based algorithm. These topics are related to information theory (cs.IT), network infrastructure (cs.NI), control systems (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
