The proposed method is applied to sequential data, which is often used in computer vision and natural language processing (cs.CV, cs.CL). The paper also mentions molecular generation and optimization problems, which are relevant to computational chemistry and materials science (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
