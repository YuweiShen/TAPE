The use of automated reasoning programs such as OTTER suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper specifically focuses on propositional calculus, which falls under the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). The study of axioms and inference rules also suggests a connection to Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the extension of the study to infinite-valued sentential calculus and intuitionistic logic suggests a connection to Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
