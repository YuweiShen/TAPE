The use of a deep neural network also suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of these psychological attributions on social decision making, which suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper also discusses the visualization of important features for perception of these attributes, which suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
