Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of deep learning models also suggests the possibility of cs.DL (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) as it aims to extract content from documents. The evaluation of the system's performance suggests the possibility of cs.LG (Learning) as well. Finally, the use of historical handwritten documents suggests the possibility of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
