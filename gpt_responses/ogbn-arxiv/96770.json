The paper develops a unified approach to time delay estimation from low-rate samples by formulating the problem in the broader context of sampling over an infinite union of subspaces. This approach is related to several subfields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and statistical inference (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
