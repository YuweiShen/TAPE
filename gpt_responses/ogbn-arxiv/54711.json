The paper also discusses the design factors and training methods for the neural network, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of residual networks and dropout techniques also suggests a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which is commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
