The paper discusses the development of a new model, CORnet-S, which is a shallow ANN with recurrent connectivity and is guided by Brain-Score, a composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for quantifying the functional fidelity of models of the primate ventral visual stream. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper is primarily focused on object recognition and visual processing, which are key topics in computer vision. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the development of a new neural network model, CORnet-S, which has recurrent connectivity and is guided by Brain-Score. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the evolution of deep convolutional ANNs and their performance on machine learning tasks, and also introduces a new model, CORnet-S, which is designed to perform well on both machine learning and neuroscience measures. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the development of a new neural network model, CORnet-S, which is designed to be more brain-like and perform well on both machine learning and neuroscience measures. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): While not a primary focus of"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
