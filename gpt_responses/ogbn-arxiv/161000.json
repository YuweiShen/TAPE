It may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the paper focuses on query-focused multi-document summarization. Additionally, the use of learning-based compression models and beam search decoder suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the integration of various metrics into the compression process may suggest that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
