The paper combines ideas from Harmonic Analysis and Hashing-Based-Estimators to provide a general framework for designing such data structures through hashing. This makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) the most likely category. The paper also deals with approximation theory and distance-sensitive hashing, which are relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), respectively. The paper's application to Kernel Density and Partition Function Estimation makes cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) possible categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
