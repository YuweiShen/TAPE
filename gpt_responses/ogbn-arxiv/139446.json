Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.DB (Databases) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents two operational definitions of SI as lock-based reference implementations, which could fall under the cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories. Finally, the paper introduces a new adaptation of SI called robust snapshot isolation (RSI), which could also fit under the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
