The first case study involves the use of deep learning techniques to extract visual information of buildings from satellite/street view images, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The second case study involves the use of automated deep learning-based procedures for identifying soft-story buildings from street view images, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed framework and statistical tool for building information modeling involve the use of graph theory and spatial analysis, which fall under the graphics (cs.GR) and augmented reality (cs.AR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
