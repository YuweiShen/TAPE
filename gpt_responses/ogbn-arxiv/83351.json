The use of a satisfiability modulo theory solver (SMT solver) suggests a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the hierarchical construction of vocabularies may also relate to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
