The paper also discusses practical aspects of the algorithm and presents experimental comparisons, which further supports the relevance to robotics.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with kinodynamic planning, which is a problem in systems and control. The assumptions on the system (Lipschitz-continuity of the dynamics) also suggest a connection to this sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a novel analysis of a planning algorithm, which is a common topic in AI. The algorithm also uses heuristics to guide the search, which further supports the relevance to AI.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the use of heuristics and the optimization of a cost function suggest a connection to this sub-category.\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper does not seem to have a direct connection to programming languages, but the algorithmic nature of the problem and the use of a tree-based planner suggest a possible connection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
