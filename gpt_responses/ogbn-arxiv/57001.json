The proposed algorithms are also evaluated on machine learning tasks.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes distributed methods for compressed iterates, which is a problem related to distributed computing. The communication complexity bounds also suggest a distributed computing perspective.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes iterative optimization methods with compressed iterates, which is a problem related to optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithms are also fixed point methods, which is a topic in algorithms.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper establishes communication complexity bounds for the proposed algorithms, which is a problem related to information theory.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes methods for distributed optimization, which is a problem related to control systems. The proposed algorithms also have variance reduction techniques, which is a topic in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
