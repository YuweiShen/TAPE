Specifically, the paper focuses on the approximation of various signal structures, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of ReLU activation functions and the analysis of network width and depth suggest a focus on neural network theory (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper's emphasis on approximation error and the use of exponential decay suggest a connection to statistical learning theory, which is a subfield of machine learning and falls under the cs.LG category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
