The paper also focuses on continuous control tasks, which are often studied in the robotics sub-category (cs.RO). The use of hierarchical structures and their benefits for transfer learning are also discussed, which could fall under the systems and control sub-category (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions empirical results on tasks that involve visual perception, which could relate to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
