The use of convexity and concave functions is a common technique in optimization and machine learning (cs.MA), and the paper applies this concept to the node self-dynamics. The paper also mentions the use of distributed sub-gradient methods, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and optimization (cs.NE). The paper deals with large-scale networks, which is a topic in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG).
