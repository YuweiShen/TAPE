The paper also discusses the use of Classical Planning heuristics and algorithms, which falls under the subfield of Planning (cs.PL). The paper also mentions Context-Free Grammars, which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). The paper's focus on heuristics and algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's discussion of limitations and potential improvements in Planning heuristics suggests that it may also be relevant to Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
