The paper proposes means to evaluate relative evolutionary distances between species and to infer common ancestor genomes to a group of species. This involves designing algorithms and distance formulae, which are typical topics in computer science. The paper also deals with the complexity proofs of these algorithms, which is a topic in theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with biological data and the study of species evolution, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.BIO (Computational Biology) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
