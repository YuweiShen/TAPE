The problem formulation and optimization techniques used in the paper also involve stochastic control (cs.SY) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper proposes a predictive control policy based on expected power reciprocal, which could be related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
