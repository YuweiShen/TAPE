The paper proposes a new optimization framework for personalized ranking, which is a popular approach in recommendation systems, and thus falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed framework on matrix factorization, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
