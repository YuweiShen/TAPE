The paper also deals with the concept of resilience, which is a common concern in the field of cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and protocols for distributed systems, which is a topic covered in the sub-category of distributed algorithms (cs.Distributed). Finally, the paper presents a proof, which involves mathematical reasoning and analysis, making it relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
