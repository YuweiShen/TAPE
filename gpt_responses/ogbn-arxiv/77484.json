It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as reinforcement learning is a subfield of AI. Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of algorithms, which could place it in the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The use of policies in computer vision tasks could also place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category.
