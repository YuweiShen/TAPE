This involves the use of information engineering concepts and the storage of data in IoT devices, leading to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT). The paper focuses on the underlying structure of IOMT, particularly the Personal Area Networks (PANs) that allow sensors to measure changes in stimuli and transmit information to various stakeholders. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses challenges related to security and privacy of data, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CY (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper explores prevalent IOMT applications, which could be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper discusses various vendors that provide IOMT services, which could be classified under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
