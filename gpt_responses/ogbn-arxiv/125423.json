The use of meta-learning and recurrent neural networks also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the optimization of functions, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed method to an industrial optimization problem, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
