This involves modeling sequential interactions between users and the recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses Reinforcement Learning to learn optimal strategies for recommending items to users. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of recommending personalized items or services to users, which is a core problem in Information Retrieval. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to building recommender systems that can continuously improve their strategies during interactions with users, which is a key problem in Artificial Intelligence. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the problem of recommending personalized items or services to users, which is a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with the problem of information overload and proposes a solution that can help mitigate this problem, which is a key problem in Computers and Society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
