The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The authors also mention the improved generalization of their approach, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper includes experiments with popular network architectures, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
