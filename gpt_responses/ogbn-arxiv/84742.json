The use of optimization techniques to find optimal sensor locations and the focus on efficient classification suggest that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of l1-minimization and the mention of a coupling parameter suggest that the paper may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on optimization and efficient classification may also make it relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
