Therefore, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new method for detecting adversarial examples, which falls under the sub-field of cybersecurity (cs.CR). The use of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to characterize adversarial regions involves the analysis of high-dimensional data, which is relevant to the sub-fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
