The concept of functional currents is introduced as a new mathematical framework to model and process these shapes. Given this focus, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deals with image and signal processing. The paper also involves geometric and functional analysis, which suggests the sub-categories cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.IT (Information Theory) as likely candidates. The use of a Hilbertian norm and processing algorithms points towards cs.LG (Machine Learning) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the registration of functional shapes under diffeomorphic transport suggests cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as a potential sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
