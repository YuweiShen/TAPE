Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of feature selection and morphological analysis, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and data mining, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper describes the use of Semcor for training in the English all-words task, indicating that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper focuses on the development of systems for specific languages, which suggests that cs.CY (Computers and Society) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
