The paper focuses on the limitations of the empirical Fisher approximation, which is commonly used in machine learning optimization algorithms. Given this focus, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
