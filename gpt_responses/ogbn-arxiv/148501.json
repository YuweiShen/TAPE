The triangulations are constructed on smooth closed submanifolds of Euclidean space, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the subcategory of computational geometry dealing with geometric representations of surfaces and manifolds (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the stability of Delaunay triangulations, which is a topic in computational topology (cs.DG). Additionally, the paper discusses the tangential Delaunay complex, which is a concept in computational geometry related to the study of geometric graphs (cs.SG). Finally, the paper mentions the avoidance of geodesic distances, which is a topic in computational geometry related to the study of metric spaces and their embeddings (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
