The paper proposes a ten-dimensional metric to quantify the structural characteristics of information cascades, and analyzes the high-order structural patterns of information cascades. The paper also evaluates to what extent the structural features of information cascades can explain its dynamic patterns and semantics. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DL (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
