The problem also involves optimization and decision-making, which could place it in the cs.AL (Computational Complexity) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) categories. The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as supply-chain management and sensor networks, suggest that it could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) category.
