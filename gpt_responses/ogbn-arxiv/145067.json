This falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also uses data-driven methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Time Delay Neural Network, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the control of a robotic system, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
