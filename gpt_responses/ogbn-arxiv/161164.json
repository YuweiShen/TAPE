These are typical topics in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper uses matrix multiplication and determinant algorithms, which are also relevant to cs.NA and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
