The use of low-power wireless technology and embedded devices also suggests that it could belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) category. The use of inverted pendulums as a physical system suggests that it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) category. The evaluation of stability and associated costs suggests that it could belong to the electromagnetics (cs.EM) category. Finally, the focus on promoting adoption, scalability, repeatability, and integration with existing wireless testbed infrastructures suggests that it could belong to the cybernetics (cs.CY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
