The use of graph-cut algorithm and RANSAC also suggests that cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.RO (Robotics) are possible categories. The paper also introduces a novel method for estimation, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
