The algorithm is based on tensor recovery with sparse and low-rank constraints, and it is solved with an alternating minimization approach. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.NA sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with a big-data approach to handle many process variations in the design of integrated circuits, microelectromechanical systems, and photonic circuits. The approach is based on tensor recovery with sparse and low-rank constraints, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the idea of exploiting hidden structures in a high-dimensional data array is a common theme in network analysis and machine learning. Therefore, the paper could be relevant to the cs.SI sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a tensor recovery algorithm with sparse and low-rank constraints to handle high-dimensional data arrays efficiently. This is a common technique in machine learning, and it suggests that the paper could be relevant to the cs.LG sub-category.\n- cs.ET (Emer"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
