Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses measurement techniques and control schemes, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and system and control theory (cs.SY). The use of highly directional antennas and the need for precise alignment also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of beam management on the overall network architecture, which could be categorized under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
