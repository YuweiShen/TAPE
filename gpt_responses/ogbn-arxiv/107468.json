Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel method for introducing orthogonality into the CNN structure, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on image classification tasks, which is a sub-field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
