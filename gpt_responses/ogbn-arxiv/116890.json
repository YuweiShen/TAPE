Additionally, the use of cascaded regression and mapping matrices are common techniques in computer vision. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as the proposed method is based on a summation model and uses cascaded regression, which are both machine learning techniques. \n\nThe artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper proposes a method that can automatically generate both pose-and-expression-normalized (PEN) and expressive 3D faces, which requires some level of artificial intelligence. \n\nThe multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is another possibility as the paper deals with 3D face reconstruction, which is a multimedia-related topic. \n\nFinally, the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category is a possibility as the paper deals with 3D face reconstruction, which is a graphics-related topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
