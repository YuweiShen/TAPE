It also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which could place it in the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
