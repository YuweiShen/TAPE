The metric is based on three components related to localization, false negative rate, and false positive rate, which are all common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the results of experiments on state-of-the-art object detectors, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper provides source code for computing the metric on popular datasets, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
