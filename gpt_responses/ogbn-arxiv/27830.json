The paper also mentions the use of string diagrams in programming language semantics (cs.PL), representation theory (cs.LO), algebraic quantum information (cs.QA), and quantum groups, which are all related to the use of category theory in computer science. Finally, the paper discusses the use of a tool for (semi-)automatic construction of equational proofs, which is a topic that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
