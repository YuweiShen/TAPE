Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel architecture for this task, which involves a recurrent neural network language model, so it is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a large dataset of images and captions, so it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
