The paper focuses on image classification tasks and experiments are conducted on image classification datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of different metrics for the optimal transport loss, which suggests relevance to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
