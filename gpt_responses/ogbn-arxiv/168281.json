The use of a side channel for communication between sensors suggests a focus on social and information networks (cs.SI) and networked information systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses optimization and allocation problems, which are relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
