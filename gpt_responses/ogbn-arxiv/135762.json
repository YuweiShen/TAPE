The paper also discusses the second-order achievable rate problem, which is related to statistical inference and estimation, and could be categorized under cs.MM (Machine Learning) or cs.SI (Statistical Learning). The paper uses information spectrum methods, which are commonly used in the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper establishes achievable rate regions for i.i.d. correlated sources and mixed correlated sources, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
