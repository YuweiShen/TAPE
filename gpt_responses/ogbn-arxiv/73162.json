The paper also discusses the issue of distinguishing and characterizing the activities of primary users, which involves system modeling and control (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on cognitive radio networks, which falls under the category of computer networks (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a binary inference algorithm for primary user separation, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
