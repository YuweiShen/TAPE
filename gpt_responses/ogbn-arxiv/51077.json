The paper also proposes a novel framework for object detection, which involves training a neural network to learn contextual information (cs.LG). The use of deep learning and neural networks also suggests that this paper could fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves experiments and evaluations of the proposed framework, which could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
