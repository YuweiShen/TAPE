Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also mentions deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant, as the paper discusses retrieving passages from the web to extract answers. The paper also mentions risk control, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses evaluating the approach using metrics, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
