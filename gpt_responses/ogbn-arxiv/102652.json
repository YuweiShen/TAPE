This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine the nature of the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on machine learning, natural language processing, and other AI-related topics, which are relevant to the development of the proposed system. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers research on techniques for retrieving relevant information from large datasets, which is relevant to the task of identifying the nature of the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on various machine learning techniques, which are relevant to the development of the ensemble classifier used in the proposed system. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers research on natural language processing, which is relevant to the task of identifying the nature of the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category covers research on the social and ethical implications of computing, which may be relevant to the discussion of the impact of the proposed system on the service delivery business."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
