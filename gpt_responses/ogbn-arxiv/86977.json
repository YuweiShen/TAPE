The application of these concepts to MR imaging and spectroscopy suggests a focus on Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Signal Processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the development of novel formulas for phase transitions suggests a focus on Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
