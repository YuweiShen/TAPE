The paper focuses on the development of an algorithm that combines ideas from model compression and imitation learning to learn decision tree policies guided by a DNN policy and its Q-function. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, since the paper deals with safety and stability of learned policies, it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
