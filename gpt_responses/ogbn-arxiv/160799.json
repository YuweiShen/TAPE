The paper also introduces a regularized attention mechanism to GCNNs, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The use of noisy data in KGs is a major challenge, which is addressed in the paper, making it relevant to the database (cs.DB) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
