The use of linear orderings also suggests a connection to the area of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and the study of linear orders (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper's focus on reactive systems and decision procedures suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
