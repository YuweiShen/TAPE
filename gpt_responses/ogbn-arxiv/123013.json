It also discusses the impracticality of certain construction algorithms, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the construction of LDPC codes, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of input alphabet size on the construction of codes, which could fall under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
