The use of voting weights and the Penrose square root rule also suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The consideration of single-peaked preferences and positive correlation of local voters suggests a connection to social choice theory and computational social science (cs.SI). The use of the Shapley value, a concept from cooperative game theory, suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
