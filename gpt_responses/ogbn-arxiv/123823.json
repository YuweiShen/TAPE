The paper discusses the extension of higher-order algebraic specification languages, which is a topic in logic and formal methods (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the extension of Combinatory Rewrite Systems (CRSs), which is a topic in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also discusses termination and confluence, which are topics in software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages (cs.FL), and data structures (cs.DS).
