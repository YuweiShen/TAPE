It also involves linear systems of equations, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and can be related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of semi-algebraic proofs and Gaussian elimination suggests a connection to computational geometry and real algebraic geometry (cs.SC), while the focus on unsatisfiability and refutations suggests a connection to logic and automated reasoning (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
