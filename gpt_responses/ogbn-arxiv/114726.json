The paper also discusses the running time of algorithms for this problem, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of 3SUM-hardness assumptions in the paper suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the problem of indexing a text for substring queries can also be viewed as a problem in computational geometry (cs.CG), where the text is viewed as a set of points in a high-dimensional space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
