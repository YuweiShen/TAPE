The paper proposes a new algorithm for solving asymmetric distributed constraint optimization problems (ADCOPs), which is a subfield of MAS and AI. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.MA are the most likely categories. The paper also deals with optimization problems, which is a subfield of computer science (CS) and machine learning (ML).
