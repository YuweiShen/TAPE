The paper focuses on the development of a decision-making process that simulates the steps of analyzing aspect sentiment in a document by human beings. This involves the selection of aspect-relevant clauses and sentiment-relevant words while discarding noisy clauses and words. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the study of natural language processing and computational linguistics. The proposed approach in this paper involves the use of reinforcement learning to improve DASC, which falls under the scope of cs.CL. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents, machine learning, and decision-making processes. The proposed approach in this paper involves the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning to simulate human-like decision-making in DASC, which falls under the scope of cs.AI. \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data. The proposed approach in this paper involves the use of reinforcement learning to improve DASC, which falls under the scope of cs.LG. \n\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the study of techniques and models"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
