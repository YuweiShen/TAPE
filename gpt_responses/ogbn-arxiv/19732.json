This involves the design of stepping controllers for global stabilization of the orbits. The paper also discusses the use of the model to create and stabilize the walking of bipedal robots. Given these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with the development of a model for bipedal walking, which is a key area of research in robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of stepping controllers for global stabilization of the orbits, which is a key aspect of control systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning, but the development of a model for bipedal walking could potentially involve machine learning techniques. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to the previous point, the development of a model for bipedal walking could potentially involve AI techniques. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision or pattern recognition, but these areas could potentially be relevant for the development of a model for bipedal walking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
