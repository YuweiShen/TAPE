The proposed Siamese architectures and loss functions are designed to learn discriminative features from unlabeled videos, which is a problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed models involves discovering actions and scenes in video collections, which is a task in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the benefits of using unsupervised learning as a prior for supervised recognition tasks, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
