The paper also mentions the use of active learning, which involves selecting the most informative samples for labeling, and this falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of overfitting to specific image backgrounds, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
