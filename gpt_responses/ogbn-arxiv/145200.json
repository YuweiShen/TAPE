The use of algebraic techniques and constructs such as automorphisms, cyclotomic extensions, and Kummer extensions suggests that the paper may be relevant to the subfields of information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), number theory (cs.NT), and algebraic algorithms (cs.ALG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
