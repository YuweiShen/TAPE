This involves designing equivariant convolutional models using convolution with equivariant kernels, conjugation by averaging operators, and a naturally equivariant generalization of convolution called group correlation. The paper focuses on physical dynamics, including turbulence and diffusion systems, and demonstrates the advantage of their approach. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
