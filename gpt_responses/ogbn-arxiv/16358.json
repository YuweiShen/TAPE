The use of deep learning models for anomaly detection suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The mention of a new dataset suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. The use of weakly labeled training videos suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the mention of sparsity and temporal smoothness constraints suggests that it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
