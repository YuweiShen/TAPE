This involves techniques from information theory (IT) such as probability mass functions and coding, as well as networking (NI) concepts like synchronization and equalization. The paper also discusses the experimental setup and performance evaluation, which falls under the category of optical networking (OH) and communication (COMM). Finally, the use of QAM modulation and shaping techniques is closely related to the field of photonics (PHOTONICS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
