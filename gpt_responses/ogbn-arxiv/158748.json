The paper also discusses the use of pretext tasks and the development of a new approach called Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL), which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on several benchmarks for self-supervised learning, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
