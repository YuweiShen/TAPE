This involves designing a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices to incentivize households to manage energy resources in a way that responds to both pro-sumer and operator needs. This requires a systems and control perspective to ensure the stability and reliability of the grid.\n- cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The proposed solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform, which requires cryptography and security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of transactions and data.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The proposed market mechanism involves game-theoretic concepts such as Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficiency to ensure that households have incentives to participate in the market and trade energy with their neighbors.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Similar to cs.CY, the proposed solution involves cryptography and security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of transactions and data.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed solution involves a distributed architecture where households can autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators, and market actors. This requires efficient and scalable distributed computing techniques to ensure the timely and reliable execution of transactions and data processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
