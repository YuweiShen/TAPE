Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses the addition of new connectives, which is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions interaction principles, which are studied in the context of computational complexity (cs.CC). Furthermore, the paper involves the characterization of fragments of logic, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
