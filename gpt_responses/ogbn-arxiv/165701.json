The use of deep learning methods also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of SLAM suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The evaluation of the method on datasets suggests that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning methods for semantic labelling suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
