The paper also focuses on the usability and human-computer interaction aspects of these passwords, which suggests a potential fit for the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category. The use of Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) and Markov chains for modeling the password distributions suggests a potential fit for the information retrieval (cs.IR) category. The paper also discusses the statistical distribution of password spaces, which could fit under the social and information networks (cs.SI) category. Finally, the paper discusses the security of Android unlock patterns, which could fit under the cryptography and security (cs.CY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
