It proposes a new algorithm called Least Squares Deep Q-Network (LS-DQN) and tests it on Atari games. The paper focuses on the improvement of DRL algorithms and the stability of the learning process, which are topics that are commonly studied in the machine learning and artificial intelligence communities. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper uses neural networks and optimization techniques, which are also relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with control and decision-making problems, which are relevant to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
