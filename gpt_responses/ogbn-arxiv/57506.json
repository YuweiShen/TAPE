However, since the paper focuses on the algorithmic aspect of the problem, cs.DM and cs.DS are the most likely categories. The use of decomposition-based algorithms and the decomposition theorem of da Silva and Vuskovic also suggest that cs.CG and cs.GT are possible categories. Finally, the running time analysis of the algorithm indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the field of cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
