The hierarchical structure of the code ensembles also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of the generalized random energy model (GREM) and its application to code design may also fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
