This involves learning communication protocols in a partially observable environment. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper discusses the learned protocols, which suggests a focus on natural language processing and communication, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) a likely sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning technology also suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
