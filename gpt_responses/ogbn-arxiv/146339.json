The use of exploration bonuses is a popular technique in reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of machine learning. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, which is a topic of interest in the field of theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of exploration bonuses in multi-agent settings, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed algorithms in continuous state spaces, which is a topic of interest in the field of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
