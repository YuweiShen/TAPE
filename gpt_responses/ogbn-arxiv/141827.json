The paper also discusses the Kozachenko-Leonenko estimator of differential entropy, which is a well-known method in statistics and data science (cs.DS). The paper's focus on nonparametric estimation and the use of nearest neighbor distances suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of similarity search (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's discussion of modifying the KSG estimator to construct a superior estimator suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of algorithm design and optimization (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
