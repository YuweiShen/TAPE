The paper proposes a new approach called preference-driven similarity join, which allows users to specify their preferences for the similarity join result instead of a fixed threshold. This approach involves optimization techniques and objective functions to compute the similarity join result. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DB (Database Systems): The paper proposes a new approach for similarity join, which is a common task in database systems. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on real-world web datasets. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of finding similar objects across different sources, which is a common task in information retrieval. The paper proposes a new approach for similarity join that can capture user preferences. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach for similarity join that involves optimization techniques and objective functions. These are common techniques in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new approach for similarity join that involves optimization techniques and objective functions. These are common topics in data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new approach for similarity join that can capture user preferences. This involves objective functions, which are commonly used in machine learning"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
