This technique is applicable to many online selection problems, including Bayesian online selection, oblivious posted pricing mechanisms, and stochastic probing models. These problems are typically studied in the areas of data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information theory (cs.IT). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
