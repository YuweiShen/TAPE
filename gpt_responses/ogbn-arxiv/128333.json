The use of Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SdA) and deep neural networks also suggests a focus on \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The application of these techniques to improve SVM classification accuracy suggests a focus on \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV) and \"Natural Language Processing\" (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
