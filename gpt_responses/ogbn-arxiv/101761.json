The paper also discusses defending against these attacks, which involves machine learning techniques such as kernel density estimation and Bayesian uncertainty, suggesting a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the attacks and defenses, which could fall under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the dataset of annotated photographs of adversarial patches could be useful for researchers working on multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
