The paper proposes a new exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods, which is related to the topic of reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses neural networks to predict features of the observations, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses combining intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
