The analysis of equilibria and interventions is a typical topic in game theory, which makes this category highly likely. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses different hiring practices and their impact on fairness, which is a common concern in machine learning applications. Moreover, the use of statistical discrimination and reputation systems can be seen as machine learning techniques, which further supports this category. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the social implications of hiring practices and fairness interventions in the labor market, which is a core topic in the computers and society field. The discussion of group-based and individual-based fairness also aligns with this category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes the feedback loop between individual and collective reputations, which is a typical topic in social network analysis. Moreover, the use of reputation systems and fairness interventions can be seen as network interventions, which further supports this category. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although less likely, the paper discusses the impact of hiring practices on discrimination and social justice, which can be seen as a security issue.
