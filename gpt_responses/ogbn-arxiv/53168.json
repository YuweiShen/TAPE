This is a topic related to data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper mentions the use of lightweight cryptographic hash functions in the protocol, indicating a possible connection to cryptography and security. \n4. cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing) - The paper deals with BFT storage, which is a subfield of distributed computing. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper presents a new protocol for BFT storage, which can be seen as a system or control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
