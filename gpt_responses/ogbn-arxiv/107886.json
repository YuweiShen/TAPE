Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of a fixed model-based decoder, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The re-projection module controlled by the view parameters suggests the involvement of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of weak supervision, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
