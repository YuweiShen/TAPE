It also discusses the semantics of a logic system, which is a topic in mathematical logic (cs.LO). The paper also introduces a new entailment relation, which is a topic in logic programming (cs.PL). The denotational semantics used in the paper is related to set theory and mathematical structures, which are topics in computer science theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the expressiveness of the logic system, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
