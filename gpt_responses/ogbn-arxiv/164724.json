The use of deep learning models for this task also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The mention of similarity scores and the use of a similarity-based approach could indicate that it belongs to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of few-shot learning techniques suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of benchmarks and evaluation metrics suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
