Information theory is closely related to coding theory, and polar codes are a recent development in coding theory. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper mentions the use of synthetic channels and ranking them through a closed-form $\\beta$-expansion. This could be related to network analysis and modeling. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the recursive construction of polar codes and solving polynomial equations at each step. This could be related to algorithm design and analysis. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper mentions the desire for low-complexity construction of polar codes, which could be related to computational complexity. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper mentions an example of AWGN channels, which could be related to networking and communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
