The paper also demonstrates the quality of the generated images using Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which is a common metric used in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper involves formulating an objective function for GAN training, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves clustering in the embedding space, which is a common topic in graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
