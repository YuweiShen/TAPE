This tool has implications for urban design and transportation, which are relevant to the societal impact of computing. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the analysis of street networks, which can be considered a type of social network. The paper also discusses the use of graph theory to analyze these networks, which is relevant to the study of information networks. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of algorithms to correct network topology and to calculate metric and topological measures of street networks. These topics are relevant to computational engineering and science. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): There is no direct mention of cryptography or security in the paper, but the use of OpenStreetMap data raises potential privacy concerns that could be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the saving of street networks to disk in various file formats, which is relevant to databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
