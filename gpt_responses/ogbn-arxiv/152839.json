The paper also discusses lattices and constellations, which are topics in discrete mathematics and computer science (cs.DS). The study of goodness properties such as packing goodness and AWGN goodness falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions a number-theoretic conjecture, which suggests a connection to theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
