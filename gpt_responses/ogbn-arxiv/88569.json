It also discusses a heuristic approach to balance the greediness of backups, which is a common problem in AI. \n\nThe paper also involves theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, which suggest that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) categories. \n\nThe paper's focus on decision-making and optimization suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper's use of MCTS in robotics applications suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
