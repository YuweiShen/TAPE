This falls under the domain of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of semantic annotations and event analytics also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the unlocking of knowledge in text corpora, which can be related to database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
