The paper proposes a multi-channel attention mechanism for feature space analysis, which is related to attention models in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper applies the proposed method to multi-attribute recognition, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
