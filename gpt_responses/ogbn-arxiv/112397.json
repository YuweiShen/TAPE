Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves human-computer interaction, as it uses human gaze data to train the model, which suggests the category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Additionally, the paper involves multimedia processing, as it deals with video frames, which suggests the category cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves clustering, which suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves neural networks, which suggests the category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
