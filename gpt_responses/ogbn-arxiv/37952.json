The use of deep neural networks (DNN) autoencoders in the communication system suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing category (cs.NE). The paper discusses the vulnerability of the communication system to adversarial attacks, which is a topic related to computer security (cs.CR). The paper also compares the performance of classical coding schemes and autoencoders, which suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning category (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of adversarial attacks on the overall system, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control category (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
