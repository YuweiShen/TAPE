The paper also makes use of Channel State Information (CSI) to extract keys, which is a concept related to information theory (cs.IT) and wireless networking (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes mechanisms to fully exploit the properties of CSI, which could be considered as a contribution to computer engineering (cs.CE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
