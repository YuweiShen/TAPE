The paper also introduces a new variant of the Stochastic Probing model, which is a well-studied problem in game theory and algorithmic mechanism design (cs.GT). The paper proposes approximation algorithms based on multilinear relaxation and contention resolution schemes, which are common techniques in approximation algorithms and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.IT). The paper also discusses the special case when the set systems are the intersection of matroids, which is a classic topic in combinatorial optimization and algorithmic graph theory (cs.DS, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
