This involves developing new algorithms that explicitly discover the underlying G-causality structure in a principled manner. The paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
