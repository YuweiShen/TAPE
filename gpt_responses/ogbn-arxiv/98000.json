The focus on optimizing transmit power and considering channel estimation and pilot contamination also suggests a strong connection to information theory and networking. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.AR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
