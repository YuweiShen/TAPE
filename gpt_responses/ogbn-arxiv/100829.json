The paper discusses combinatorial algorithms for various classes of graphs, which suggests that it may belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also discusses group theory and its limitations in solving ListIso, which suggests that it may belong to cs.GT (Group Theory) as well.
