The use of random features of the kernel's Fourier transform also suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms, which could be relevant to topics such as numerical optimization (cs.NE) and scientific computing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
