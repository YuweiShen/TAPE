Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the processing, transmission, and storage of information. The paper also proposes an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for solving the optimization problems, which involves computational techniques and algorithms, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) another likely category. The paper also discusses the use of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and global optimization, which are topics covered in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), respectively. Finally, the paper's focus on signal processing applications suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
