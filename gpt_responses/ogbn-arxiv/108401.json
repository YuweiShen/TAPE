This approach has potential applications in robotic vision and autonomous driving, which suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of inverse methods based on Expectation-Maximization, which suggests that it may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves experimental results with a prototype keyhole imaging system, which suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) or other (cs.OH) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
