The use of multiple antennas and quantization of signals suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.COMM sub-category. The analysis of achievable rates and performance loss involves system modeling and optimization, which are covered by the cs.SY sub-category. The use of multiple antennas and feedback also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the cs.MM sub-category. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the cs.NI sub-category, which covers networking and internet architecture, as it deals with the challenges of inter-user interference in wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
