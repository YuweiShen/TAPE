Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves analyzing and improving upper bounds, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of mathematical techniques and proofs suggests that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
