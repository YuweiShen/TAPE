This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the optimal signaling structure for communication for asymmetric MIMO, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI). The study of MIMO channels and their properties is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
