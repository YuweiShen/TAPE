This is a common problem in machine learning and optimization, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also provides non-asymptotic bounds on the performance of various algorithms, which is a topic of interest in numerical analysis and optimization, falling under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The paper also deals with optimization algorithms, falling under cs.Optimization. The use of an optimization oracle and the analysis of the estimation error component is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence, falling under cs.AI. Finally, the paper deals with stochastic systems, which is a topic of interest in control theory and systems engineering, falling under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
