This involves analyzing real-world loading conditions in high-frequency supervisory control and data acquisition data, which falls under the purview of systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method for continuously optimizing the farm's control protocols without the need to fully understand the loads that occur involves the use of machine learning algorithms, which falls under the purview of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a method to detect operational zones in wind farm data and link them with load distributions, which involves computational analysis of large datasets. This falls under the purview of computational engineering. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a preventive row-based control protocol for a case of cascading emergency brakes induced by a storm, which involves the development of software for controlling wind turbines. This falls under the purview of software engineering. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): While the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the use of wind turbines can be seen as a form of robotics, and the proposed methods for optimizing control protocols and preventing failures can be seen as falling under the purview of robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
