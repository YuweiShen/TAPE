The algorithm is also inspired by the well-known RELIEF algorithm, which is commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data mining (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper mentions empirical tests performed on the method's ability to handle large sets of instances, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
