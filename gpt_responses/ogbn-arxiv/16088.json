It also involves the use of Grammatical Framework, a categorial grammar formalism specialized for multilingual grammars, which is commonly used in the field of computational linguistics. \n\nIt could also belong to \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper discusses the use of a computational approach to extract and generate a multilingual grammar and lexicon. \n\n\"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category as the paper involves the use of annotated corpora to automatically extract semantico-syntactic valence patterns, which is a common technique in machine learning for natural language processing. \n\n\"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural networks or evolutionary algorithms, but these techniques could potentially be used in the implementation of the proposed approach. \n\nFinally, \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) is another less likely sub-category as the paper does not focus on information retrieval specifically, but the developed resources could potentially be used in information retrieval applications that involve controlled natural language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
