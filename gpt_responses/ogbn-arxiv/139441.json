The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also supports this assumption as CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks. The paper also discusses the use of wavelet transform, which is a signal processing technique, indicating that it may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The focus on improving the performance of CNNs suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
