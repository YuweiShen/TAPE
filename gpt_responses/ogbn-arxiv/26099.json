The use of folded Reed-Solomon codes and their connection to RS codes suggest that the paper may also be relevant to algebraic coding theory (cs.DS) and computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of expander-based codes and list recovery techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
