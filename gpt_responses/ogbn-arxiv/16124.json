This topic falls under the scope of social networks and computational social science, which are covered by the cs.SOC and cs.SI sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of a model to capture the behavior of agents, which suggests a potential fit for the cs.AI sub-category. Additionally, the paper analyzes the impact of exogenous parameters on network evolution, which could be relevant to the cs.DS sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for asymmetries in popularity evolution, which could be relevant to the cs.CYBER sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
