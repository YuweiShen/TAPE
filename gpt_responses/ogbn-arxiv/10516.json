The use of site graphs, which have locally unique names, suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS). The algorithms presented are based on edge enumeration and partition refinement, which are common techniques in computational geometry (cs.CG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the algorithms in terms of automorphisms and bisimulation equivalences, which are concepts commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
