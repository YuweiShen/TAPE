It also mentions the use of implicit surface representation, which is a common technique in computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for learning a general shape template, which falls under the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of structured implicit functions, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
