Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of orthogonal frequencies to avoid destructive interference, which falls under the category of electromagnetic theory and applications, making cs.EM (Electromagnetics) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the development of low-energy battery-less sensor nodes, which falls under the category of electronic devices and circuits, making cs.ET (Embedded Systems) a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of multiple transmitters to compensate for path-loss attenuation, which falls under the category of control systems and robotics, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of spectrum analysis to measure received power, which falls under the category of information theory and signal processing, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
