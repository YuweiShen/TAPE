This involves both computer security (cs.CR) and networking (cs.NI) aspects. The paper also discusses implementation considerations such as stealth and modulation methods, which fall under software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper evaluates AirHopper and demonstrates how textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from physically isolated computer to mobile phones, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
