It proposes a time-aware retrieval model that leverages temporal evidence from external collections to improve search results. The paper focuses on the application of this model to social media data, which is a common topic in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques, such as query expansion and re-ranking, which are relevant to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques, which are relevant to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which are relevant to the Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
