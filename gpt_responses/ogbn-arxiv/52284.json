The proposed approach is evaluated on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) datasets, indicating the potential applicability of the method to these subfields. Additionally, the use of deep neural networks in the proposed approach suggests the relevance of the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
