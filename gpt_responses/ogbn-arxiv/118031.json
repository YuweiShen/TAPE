Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security problems and proposes solutions, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, since NDN involves data centers and content distribution, it could also be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, since the paper discusses security issues, it could also be categorized under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
