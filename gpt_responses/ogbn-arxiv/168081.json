The paper proposes a framework for decomposing global types into lighter ones, which can reduce redundant interactions. This work is likely to be classified under Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) because session types are closely related to process calculi and formal methods. It could also be classified under Programming Languages (cs.PL) because session types are used to ensure communication safety in programming languages. Software Engineering (cs.SE) is another possible category because session types are used to specify and verify communication protocols in distributed systems. Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) is also a possible category because session types are used to ensure communication safety in distributed systems. Finally, Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) is another possible category because session types are related to formal language theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
