The paper also discusses the use of architectural modifications to achieve this goal, which is a common theme in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of adversarial attacks, which is a topic in the computer security (cs.CR) sub-category.
