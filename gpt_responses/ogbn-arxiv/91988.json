This falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). The paper specifically focuses on the interpretation of deep learning models using graph structure and cooperative game theory, which is relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of fMRI data for ASD biomarker discovery is relevant to cs.CV, while the application of neural networks is relevant to cs.NE. Finally, the use of computational methods for biomarker discovery falls under the sub-category of cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
