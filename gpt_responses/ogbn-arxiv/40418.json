Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and end-to-end models, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of adaptive training, which could fall under the category of speech processing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
