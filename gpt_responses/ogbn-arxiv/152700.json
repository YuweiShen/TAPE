The proposed analytical expressions and link adaptation algorithm are related to networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper uses the Shannon theorem to analyze the transmission in terms of Signal to Noise Ratio, bandwidth utilization, and energy per transmitted bit. This is related to information theory.\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper discusses the new transmission approaches introduced by NB-IoT to improve coverage extension beyond existing cellular technologies. This is related to communications and networking.\n4. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The paper mentions the large number of low-complexity and low-power devices that are connected in massive Machine-Type Communications applications. This is related to multiagent systems.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed link adaptation algorithm is a control system that adjusts the transmission parameters based on the device's coverage. This is related to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
