The use of hard decision decoding is also a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to network information theory (cs.NI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the design of binary and nonbinary codes, which is related to coding theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
