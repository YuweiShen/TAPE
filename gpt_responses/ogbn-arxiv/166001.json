The paper also proposes several methods using fully convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it uses deep learning methods for change detection. The paper may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category as it deals with processing large scale Earth observation data. Finally, the paper may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) category as it deals with land cover mapping and visualization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
