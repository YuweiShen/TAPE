The paper also discusses random coding techniques, which are often used in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of superposition coding, which is a technique commonly used in wireless communication systems (cs.SI). The paper also discusses multiuser channels, which fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) and networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
