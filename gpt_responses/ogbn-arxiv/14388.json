The paper also discusses the use of knowledge compilation, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for efficient reasoning. The paper introduces a new technique for constructing lineage representations, which involves decomposable circuits, a topic that falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO).
