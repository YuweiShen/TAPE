This involves navigation and image processing, which are core topics in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method also relies on image analysis using deep neural networks (cs.CV) and reinforcement learning algorithms (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with control policies for the UAV (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
