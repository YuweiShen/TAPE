The framework uses reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of graph neural networks, which are a specific type of neural network designed for graph data (cs.DS). The problems being solved are NP-hard, which is a subfield of theoretical computer science (cs.DM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel learning strategy based on AlphaGo Zero, which is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, falling under the scope of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
