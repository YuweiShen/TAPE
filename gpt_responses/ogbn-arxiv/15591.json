This involves using a model of dialectical argumentation to represent scientific uncertainty and conflict in a manner suitable for qualitative reasoning about the domain. This work involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) in developing the intelligent system, natural language processing (cs.CL) in modeling dialectical argumentation, and cybersecurity (cs.CR) and social and information networks (cs.SI) in considering the implications of scientific reasoning in risk assessment and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
