The paper proposes a novel algorithm for generating large and accurate sets of redescriptions, which can be used for constructing knowledge bases and decision support systems. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), databases (cs.DB), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
