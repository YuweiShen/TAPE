This involves data transfer rates and signal processing, which are key areas of information theory.\n\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the limitations of current VR systems and proposes a novel multi-detector hemispherical VR headset design to tackle the beam misalignment problem caused by the VR user's random head orientation. This involves designing for human factors and interaction, which is a key area of human-computer interaction.\n\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new wireless technology for VR systems, which involves networking and internet architecture.\n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of VR and AR systems, which are multimedia technologies.\n\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of visible light communication (VLC) for establishing high-speed wireless links between a rendering computer and a VR headset. This involves robotics and automation, which is a key area of robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
