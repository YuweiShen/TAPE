This involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques to detect and locate the sweet peppers, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) to enable the robot to learn and improve its harvesting performance. The use of sensors and control systems to enable autonomous operation also falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
