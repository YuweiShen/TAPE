This work involves computer vision (facial video representation) and machine learning (deep learning model), which are both covered by the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on pain intensity assessment, which is related to healthcare (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. Finally, the proposed model is inspired by brain disorders that affect facial expressions, which is related to neuroscience (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
