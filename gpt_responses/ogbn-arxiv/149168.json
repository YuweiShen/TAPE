Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves the use of polynomials and their properties, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the analysis of linear complexity involves the study of algorithms and data structures, which could place the paper in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
