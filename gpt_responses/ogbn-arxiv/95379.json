This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The proposed algorithm involves reducing noise in the resulting image, which could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the computation cost of the algorithm, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
