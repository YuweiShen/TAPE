The paper specifically addresses the issue of supervisory signals in the training process, which is related to the sub-field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed Max-Mahalanobis center loss is a novel technique for improving robustness, which could also be relevant to the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
