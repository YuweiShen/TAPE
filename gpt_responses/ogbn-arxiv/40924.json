The proposed methods involve optimization algorithms and feature fusion, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses communication costs and convergence, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
