The use of compressed linear measurements suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The proposed correlation model and optimization problem involve regularization and feature selection, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
