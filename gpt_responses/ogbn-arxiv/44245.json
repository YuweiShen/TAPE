The paper also discusses the use of the metric in selecting bridge languages for machine translation, which further supports its relevance to NLP. \n\nThe paper also involves statistical hypothesis testing, which suggests that it could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe use of vector representations and similarity measures could also make this paper relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's potential applications in computer vision (e.g., image captioning) could make it relevant to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
