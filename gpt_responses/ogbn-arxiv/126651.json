Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of noisy labels, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses convergence rates, which is a topic in optimization (cs.DS) and statistics (cs.ST). Finally, the paper mentions the use of crowdsourcing, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
