The paper proposes a new algorithm called Unconfused Multiclass additive Algorithm (UMA) which is a generalization to the multiclass setting of the previous approaches. The paper also uses confusion matrix as a multiclass extension of the classification noise studied in the literature. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
