The paper deals with interactive question answering in visual environments, which involves tasks such as navigation, object interaction, and planning. This suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Additionally, the use of reinforcement learning and hierarchical controllers suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of natural language processing to interpret questions suggests a focus on computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
