The use of distributed word representations to search for similar questions in the virtual patient dialogue system suggests that the paper may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the evaluation of the dialogue systems on datasets collected during tests with students suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The focus on medical education and the use of conversational agents suggests that the paper may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of semantic similarity to improve question understanding suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
