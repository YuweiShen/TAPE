This approach is based on artificial intelligence techniques. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions a cost function that takes into consideration the likelihood scores of symbols and structures. This suggests the use of machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with the recognition of mathematical expressions, which involves natural language processing techniques. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the recognition of online handwritten graphics, which is a subfield of computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
