The benchmark uses object sets and proposes different metrics to account for the features and limits of the test platform, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses how the obtained indicators can provide insight into how different steps of the pipeline affect the overall grasping performance, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
