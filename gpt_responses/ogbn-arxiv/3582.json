The use of cloud computing as a delivery model for IoT applications suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The development of a tool for discovering and configuring sensors in a smart environment suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). The use of a plug-in architecture to address the challenge of heterogeneity suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the validation of the proposed solution using a test-bed of sensors suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
