Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with image and video processing. The paper also involves image compression and coding, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper proposes a novel mapping strategy for embedding secret data, which involves coding and information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely category. The paper also deals with security and cryptography, which falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves data hiding and steganography, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
