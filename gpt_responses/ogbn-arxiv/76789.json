The paper proposes a novel approach based on a knowledge graph for designing the 20Q game on Bollywood movies. The approach uses a probabilistic learning model for template-based question generation and answers prediction. The dataset of interrelated entities is represented as a weighted knowledge graph, which updates as the game progresses by asking questions. The approach can be applied to various domains, including disease detection, recommendation systems, etc., which are related to AI, machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing, and databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
