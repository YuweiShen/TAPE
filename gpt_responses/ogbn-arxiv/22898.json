The paper also proposes a secure-learning paradigm to mitigate the impact of evasion attacks, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed approach, which involves software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper argues that the proposed approach can be applied to other malware detection tasks, which falls under the category of systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
