The approach involves training a convolutional neural network on automatically-acquired datasets, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the usage of the approach as the sole input of an obstacle-avoidance controller, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
