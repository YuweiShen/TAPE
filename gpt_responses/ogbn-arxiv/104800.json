This problem is highly relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) communities. The proposed approach is based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which is a popular decision-making framework in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed approach, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.SY, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
