The paper specifically mentions the combination of Boolean algebra and Kleene algebra, which are topics within Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). The paper also discusses the encoding of Hoare logic, which is a formal system for program verification, indicating that it could belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category.
