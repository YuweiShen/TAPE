This is a core topic in logic and automata theory. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper is concerned with modelling and testing software interfaces, which is a key topic in software engineering. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the compositionality of software specifications, which is a key concern in programming language design. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper introduces a new type of automata, and discusses their properties and applications. This is a core topic in formal languages and automata theory. \n- cs.LT (Computational Linguistics): While not directly related to natural language processing, the paper's focus on automata and formal languages may be of interest to researchers in computational linguistics who work on language modelling and parsing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
