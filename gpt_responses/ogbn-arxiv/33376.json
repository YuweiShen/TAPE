This problem is related to network science and machine learning, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. The paper uses convex optimization and stationarity of graph signals to identify the graph shift operator given only its eigenvectors. This approach is related to spectral graph theory, which is covered by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also develops efficient inference algorithms based on convex relaxations of nonconvex criteria, which are related to optimization and machine learning, covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also considers noisy or incomplete eigenvectors, which are related to information theory, covered by cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper applies the proposed algorithms to social, brain, and amino-acid networks, which are related to neural networks and computational biology, covered by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
