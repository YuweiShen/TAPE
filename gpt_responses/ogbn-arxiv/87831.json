The paper proposes a novel preprocessing method for outlier removal, which is a key step in point cloud registration. This method is based on purely geometric operations and is deterministic and fast. The paper also presents experiments on synthetic and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO), computational geometry (cs.CG), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
