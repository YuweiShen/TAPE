The paper also uses concepts such as maximum likelihood estimation and expected decoding delay, which are commonly used in information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of multicast completion and decoding delay minimization in a network coding environment. The paper also proposes a graph update extension to the multicast IDNC algorithm, which is a networking-related concept. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a partially blind policy for handling completion and decoding delays in IDNC in a lossy feedback environment. This involves designing a control policy that takes into account uncertainties in the network state. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of minimizing completion and decoding delays in a network coding environment, which is a topic closely related to multimedia applications such as video streaming. \n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a graph update extension to the multicast IDNC algorithm, which involves distributing the computation of the optimal policy across multiple nodes in the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
