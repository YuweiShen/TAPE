The paper proposes a method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning agents, which involves deep learning techniques such as self-supervised learning and contrastive learning. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also involves the use of dynamics models and control, which are relevant to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of adapting to real-world conditions, which is relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
