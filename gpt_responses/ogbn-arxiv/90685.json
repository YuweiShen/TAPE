The use of sentential decision diagrams also suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The mention of non-linear constraints and potentials suggests a possible connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of propositional knowledge compilation suggests a possible connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
