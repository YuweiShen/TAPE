This involves learning the force-torque dynamics, which is a common problem in robotics and falls under the category of robot control (cs.RO). The approach involves using a multi-pose force-torque state representation and learning the dynamics model in an offline fashion, which involves machine learning techniques such as model predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning, falling under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is also applicable to various shapes, scales, and elasticities of peg-and-holes, which involves system identification and transfer learning, falling under the categories of control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
