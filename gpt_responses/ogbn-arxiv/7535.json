The paper involves techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) such as reinforcement learning (RL) and planning, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.AI sub-category. The paper also deals with optimization and decision-making problems, which are common in the cs.LG and cs.MA sub-categories. The paper's focus on high-dimensional environments and multiple moving obstacles suggests that it may also belong to the cs.RO sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of safety constraints and its approach to decomposing the CMDP problem into two MDPs suggests that it may also belong to the cs.SY sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
