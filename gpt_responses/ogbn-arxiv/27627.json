The paper also discusses the impact of quantization on accuracy, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper explores methods to lower bit-precision beyond quantization limits, which could be relevant to the field of neuromorphic computing (cs.NE) or distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
