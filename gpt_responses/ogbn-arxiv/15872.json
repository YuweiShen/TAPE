The proposed method involves graph mode-seeking and belief propagation, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of synthetic and real data, which suggests a focus on data-driven approaches, another common theme in machine learning and computer vision. The method also involves controlling the score density by localised region, which could be related to graph theory (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
