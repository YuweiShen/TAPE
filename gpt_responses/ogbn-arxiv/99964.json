It also involves the use of reachability trees, which is a tool commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and logic (cs.LO). The study of cellular automata and their properties is also relevant to systems and control theory (cs.SY) and the field of dynamical systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
