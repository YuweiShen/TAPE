This makes cs.LO a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes a new programming abstraction, which is likely to fall under cs.PL.\n3. cs.TL (Type Theory) - The paper discusses typed lambda calculi, which is a type theory. Therefore, cs.TL is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Although the paper does not directly discuss machine learning, the use of linear lambda calculus and session types may have applications in machine learning. Therefore, cs.LG is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper does not discuss computational complexity, but the use of lambda calculus and logic may have implications for computational complexity.
