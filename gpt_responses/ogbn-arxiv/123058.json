The paper also introduces new directed width measures and formalisms for the specification and manipulation of digraphs, which are topics that are commonly studied in the sub-categories of Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper provides polynomial time algorithms for counting minimum spanning strong subgraphs and maximal subgraphs, which are topics that are commonly studied in the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
