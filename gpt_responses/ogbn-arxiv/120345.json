Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses motion estimation and image deconvolution methods, which are related to machine learning (cs.MM), deep learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the restoration of structural details, which is related to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
