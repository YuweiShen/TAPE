This concept has connections to information theory and coding theory. \n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses logical reasoning and algebraic techniques to prove the main result, which is a statement about the non-existence of certain families of polynomial functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
