The strategy involves dynamically changing the video compression level depending on environmental conditions, which requires machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the impact of communication bandwidth on the accuracy of the pedestrian detection model, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a lossy compression strategy, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
