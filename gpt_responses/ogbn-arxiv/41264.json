The proposed network-based quality indicators also suggest a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). Additionally, the study involves the exploration of different software systems, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
