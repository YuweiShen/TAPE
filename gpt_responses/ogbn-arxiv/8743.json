The paper introduces a simple language for describing error models in terms of correction rules and formally defines a rule-directed translation strategy. These aspects suggest that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the system on real student attempts, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper focuses on providing feedback for introductory programming assignments, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Science Education (cs.EDU) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
