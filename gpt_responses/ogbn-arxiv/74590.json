The use of a mesh and angle constraints also suggests that the paper may fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The mention of optical flow and image tracking further supports the possibility of the paper being categorized under multimedia (cs.MM) and computer graphics (cs.CG). Finally, the use of optimization techniques and constraints may also make the paper relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
