This involves studying the propagation environment and exploiting the customizing capabilities of the RIS reflection elements. The paper also proposes two optimization schemes and a low-complexity technique for determining phase shift values. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
