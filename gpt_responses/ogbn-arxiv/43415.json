The paper also considers the use of successive interference cancelation (SIC), which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The optimization of data rates and the use of water-filling techniques are related to mathematical modeling (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the existence of an optimal number of dimensions, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
