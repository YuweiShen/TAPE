Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper involves image processing techniques, which could also fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on real-world images, which could be relevant to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper could be of interest to researchers in cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) who are interested in improving the user experience of low-light image capture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
