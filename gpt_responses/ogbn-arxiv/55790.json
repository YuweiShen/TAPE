The lower-bound proofs involve connections to computational complexity theory, specifically the #ETH and CSPs, which are topics in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves arithmetic operations in the base field, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The embeddings of CSP instances as questions about codewords of full support in a linear code involve geometric embeddings, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the Tutte polynomial is a topic in combinatorial optimization, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
