The use of CAD models also suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.MM) for automated mesh generation. Finally, the study of different approaches for correcting the frame field topology involves optimization and numerical methods, which could fall under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
