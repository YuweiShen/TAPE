It focuses on learning action embeddings for discrete actions in RL and leveraging them to transfer policy across tasks with different state space and/or discrete action space. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics and Control). The paper also validates the proposed method on gridworld navigation tasks, discretized continuous control tasks, and fighting tasks in a commercial video game, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
