Additionally, the paper mentions the maximum likelihood estimator, which is a common concept in machine learning.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions orientation estimation in cryo-Electron Microscopy, which is a common problem in computer vision and image processing.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a relaxation of the NUG problem to an SDP, which involves solving a large-scale optimization problem. This is a common problem in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SD (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a relaxation of the NUG problem to an SDP, which is a common technique in systems and control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
