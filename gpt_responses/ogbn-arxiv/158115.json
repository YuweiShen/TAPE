The use of types and type systems to characterize normalisation and cost of evaluation suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.PL (Programming Languages). The study of denotational semantics and the use of multi types (aka non-idempotent intersection types) also suggest that the paper could be classified under cs.TL (Type Theory and Logic) or cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). Finally, the operational and implementative studies of proposals for open call-by-value suggest that the paper could also be classified under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
