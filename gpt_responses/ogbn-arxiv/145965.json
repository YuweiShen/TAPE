The algorithms are designed to read a number of pixels polynomial in $1/\\epsilon$ and independent of the size of the image, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the VC-dimension bounds, which are related to machine learning and data mining (cs.DM), and the running time of the testers, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
