This method is applicable to various data modalities and model architecture choices, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
