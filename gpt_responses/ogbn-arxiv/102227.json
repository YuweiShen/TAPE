The paper also discusses the importance of features close to the higher layers, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes an extension to existing CNN architectures, which involves modifying the network connections, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on the standard ImageNet task, which is a common benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
