The paper also discusses the properties of generator and parity check tensors, which are objects commonly studied in linear algebra and combinatorics (cs.DS). The paper proposes a new coding theoretic parameter, the tensor rank, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and data science (cs.SI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between minimal tensor rank codes and MDS codes, which is a topic in coding theory and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
