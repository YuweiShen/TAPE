The paper uses techniques from differential privacy and generalization error to bound the number of samples needed to answer different types of queries. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), cryptography (cs.CR), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
