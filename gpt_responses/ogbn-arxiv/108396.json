This involves computer vision techniques such as pose estimation and feature extraction. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper involves a user study to record participants performing tasks involving deceptive walking. The study also involves annotating various gestures performed by participants during their tasks. This falls under the domain of human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves training a deep neural network to obtain deep features for detecting deceptive walking. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves using a combination of psychology-based gait, gesture, and deep features to detect deceptive walking. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper involves detecting deceptive behavior, which has implications in security and fraud detection. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
