The paper proposes a novel approach to slice-based resource allocation, which is a critical component of network slicing. This approach involves setting up a constrained resource allocation game, which is a variation of the well-known Fisher market. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) category. Additionally, the paper proposes a practical slice strategy with provable convergence properties, which may place it in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) category. The paper also involves optimization and allocation of resources, which may place it in the cs.IT (Information Theory) category. Finally, the paper deals with network efficiency, which may place it in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
