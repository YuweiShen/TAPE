The use of an extended cost volume and multiscale contextual information suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the proposed networks to stereo disparity estimation benchmarks suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
