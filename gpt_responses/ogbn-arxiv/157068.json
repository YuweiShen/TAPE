The paper also discusses the impact of discretization approaches on mining stronger rules, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses a real-life dataset and discusses the generation of rules, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
