The paper also discusses regularization and optimization techniques, which are relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of denoisers and score-matching also suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses comparisons to plug-and-play ADMM, which is a popular method in multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
