The use of feedback and the distributed nature of the transmitters also suggest a possible connection to networked systems (cs.NI) and control theory (cs.SY). The paper also involves the study of the degrees of freedom (DoF) region, which is a common concept in multiple antenna systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of secure transmission, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
