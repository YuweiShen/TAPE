This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also considers the impact of hardware impairments on the ergodic capacity, which is a measure of the long-term average transmission rate, and this falls under the domain of networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper considers the impact of hardware impairments on the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR), which is a measure of the quality of the received signal, and this falls under the domain of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
