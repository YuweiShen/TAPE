The paper also discusses the impact of space diversity and multi-user diversity, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and system theory (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of numerical simulations, which is a common practice in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
