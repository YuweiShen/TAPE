This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to AI. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses coordination mechanisms in a global service delivery system, which involves distributed teams. This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to distributed computing. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses work performance and coordination mechanisms in a large-scale global delivery system, which suggests that it is likely to be related to software engineering. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a stochastic model of service requests and a receding horizon control approach for coordination. This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to systems and control. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the importance of formal coordination mechanisms as human-based service delivery becomes more globalized, which suggests that it is likely to be related to human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
