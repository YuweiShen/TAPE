This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a bootstrap resampling method to quantify non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model estimate. This is a machine learning technique. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a learning-based control algorithm that uses a nominal model estimator and a robust control design method. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a control algorithm that can be applied to robotic systems. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention neural or evolutionary computing, the proposed algorithm can be seen as a form of adaptive control, which is a common application of neural and evolutionary computing techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
