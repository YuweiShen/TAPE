The use of finite element approximation and quadratic assignment suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of computer graphics (cs.CG) or computer vision (cs.CV). The iterative algorithm and sparsity control are also relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of point clouds and local pairwise descriptors may suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) or geometric modeling (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
