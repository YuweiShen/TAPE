The paper also discusses the stability analysis of the proposed approach. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations in ImGs, which involves adding or removing DGUs without compromising the overall ImG stability. This requires distributed computing and communication among the DGUs. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses the use of Distributed Generation Units (DGUs) in AC Islanded microGrids (ImGs), which is an emerging technology in the field of power systems. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper does not directly discuss programming languages, but it proposes a design algorithm for local controllers that can be easily implemented in software. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational approach for synthesizing local controllers for stabilizing voltage and frequency in ImGs. The approach is line-independent, which simplifies the computational complexity of the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
