The problem of determining a set of indistinguishable integers falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the use of queries and comparisons suggests a potential application in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
