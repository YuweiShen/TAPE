Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security aspects of ICN, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the management of large amounts of data, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper proposes a naming scheme for IoT-based smart campus, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
