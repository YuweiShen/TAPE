It could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it discusses the deployment of a large number of antenna elements at the base station for improving the coverage and capacity of cellular networks. The paper also focuses on the use of mmWave frequency bands, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The proposed algorithms for hybrid precoding and combining could be considered as a system-level approach, which could place the paper in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the complexity and power consumption of the proposed method, which could make it relevant to the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
