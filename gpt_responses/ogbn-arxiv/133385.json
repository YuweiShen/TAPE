The study of communication cost and error probability also falls under distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of algorithms and computational methods to solve the problem relates to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the importance of proper basis selection and reduction in dimensions suggests a possible connection to signal processing and information retrieval (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
