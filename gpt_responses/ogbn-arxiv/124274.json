The paper uses Stein variational gradient as a repulsive force to push the samples of Langevin dynamics away from the past trajectories, which is a technique commonly used in optimization and control theory. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
