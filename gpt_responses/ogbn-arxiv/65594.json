Specifically, it employs 3D-CNN and LSTM networks to analyse perturbations in the frequency and time domains, respectively. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories of arXiv CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
