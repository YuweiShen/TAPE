The use of auxiliary hypotheses from other tasks is a common technique in transfer learning, which is a subfield of both machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of these techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the Rademacher complexity, which is a measure of the complexity of a function class, and is relevant to statistical learning theory (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
