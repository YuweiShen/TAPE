This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories related to data management, machine learning, and information retrieval. \n\n- cs.DB (Database): The paper deals with large databases and proposes a MapReduce-based approach for subgraph selection. This suggests that cs.DB could be a likely sub-category. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for subgraph selection, which could fall under the scope of cs.DS. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with feature selection, which is a common problem in machine learning. This suggests that cs.LG could be a likely sub-category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with subgraph selection, which could be relevant to information retrieval tasks such as document clustering or recommendation systems. This suggests that cs.IR could be a likely sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach for subgraph selection, which could be relevant to several AI applications such as image recognition or natural language processing.
