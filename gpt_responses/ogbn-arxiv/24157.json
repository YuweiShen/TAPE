The use of relaxation oscillators and state transitioning devices also suggests a connection to \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Embedded Systems\" (cs.ES). The focus on controlling and programming the dynamics of these systems relates to \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY), while the experimental results demonstrate the potential for \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
