This falls under the scope of several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SD (Software Engineering). However, given the focus on mapping and analyzing scientific production across countries, we believe that cs.SI and cs.DL are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.IR, cs.CY, and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
