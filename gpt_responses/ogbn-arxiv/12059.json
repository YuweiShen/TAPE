The paper also involves the use of sparse representation and convex optimization, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of atomic norm constraint, which is a technique in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
