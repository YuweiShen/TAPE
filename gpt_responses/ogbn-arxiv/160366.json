The paper focuses on achieving capacity with low-complexity sequential decoders, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the optimization of polar codes for successively degraded channels, which could fall under the categories of coding theory (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of incremental retransmissions, which could fall under the categories of networking (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
