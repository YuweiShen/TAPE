The use of LP relaxations and integrality gaps suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of information theory (cs.IT). The focus on approximation algorithms and analysis of their performance suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of geometric structures in the problem formulation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of computational geometry (cs.SI).
