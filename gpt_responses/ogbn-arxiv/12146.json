The use of free probability theory to compute the singular value distribution of a network's input-output Jacobian suggests that the paper may also fall under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The comparison of different nonlinearities and weight initialization methods in deep networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the focus on improving the performance of deep learning models suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
