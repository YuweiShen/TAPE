The use of Fourier analysis in the paper suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and the study of Boolean functions on discrete structures (cs.DS). The mention of polynomial approximations and degree bounds also suggests a connection to algebraic methods in computer science (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the concentration of Fourier mass on small subsets, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
