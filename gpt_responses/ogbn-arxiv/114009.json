The proposed method, $\\propto$SVM, is a new approach that models the latent unknown instance labels together with the known group label proportions in a large-margin framework. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data science (cs.DS). Among these, machine learning (cs.LG) is the most likely sub-category as the paper proposes a new machine learning method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
