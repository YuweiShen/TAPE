This involves modeling the tuning procedure as a Markov decision process and using the policy gradient algorithm to tune the hyper-parameters. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, which is the basis for the proposed framework. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to artificial intelligence, which is also relevant to the proposed framework. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers topics related to neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are examples of stochastic optimization algorithms. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers topics related to algorithms, which is the focus of the paper. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers topics related to control systems, which is relevant to the optimization problems considered in the experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
