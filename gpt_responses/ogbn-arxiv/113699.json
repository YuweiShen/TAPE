The use of 3D convolution and spectral-spatial residual module also suggests that it may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of hyperspectral images may also make it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
