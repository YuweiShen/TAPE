The use of graph feedback and the analysis of Thompson sampling and Information Directed Sampling are also relevant to the fields of network science and information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of graph feedback and the analysis of graph structures may also make the paper relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
