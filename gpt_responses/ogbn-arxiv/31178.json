The authors also discuss the trade-off between accuracy and robustness, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of data corruption, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the authors propose a new augmentation technique, which involves adding noise to images, and evaluate its effectiveness on various benchmarks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
