The paper proposes a new approach using tropical geometry, which is a new development in the area of algebraic geometry. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), data structures (cs.DS), and control systems (cs.SY). However, given the focus on neural networks and decision boundaries, we believe that cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.NE, cs.DS, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
