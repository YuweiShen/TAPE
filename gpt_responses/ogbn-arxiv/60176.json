The paper proposes two techniques for semi-supervised learning, which involves leveraging class labels for classification or regression tasks related to the landmarks. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using these techniques on datasets with hands and faces, which suggests that it may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions backpropagation and learning effective detectors, which suggests that it may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
