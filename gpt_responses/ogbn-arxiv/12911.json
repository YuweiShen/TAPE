Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques for improving the conversion accuracy, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of entity types and coreference resolution, which are related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing).
