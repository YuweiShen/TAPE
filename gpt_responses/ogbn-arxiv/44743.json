The use of deep reinforcement learning and policy gradient methods suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The experiment involves navigation and exploration tasks, which could fall under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of computer vision techniques may also suggest the sub-category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
