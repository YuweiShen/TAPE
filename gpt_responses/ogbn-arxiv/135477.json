The paper also proposes a new pooling layer for more robust classification and regression, which involves machine learning techniques and can be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of public benchmarks for evaluation, which suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as another possible sub-category.
