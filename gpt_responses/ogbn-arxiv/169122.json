The use of a cutting-plane algorithm and a branch-and-cut algorithm suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also proposes a new formulation and introduces a new class of inequalities, which may be of interest to researchers in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
