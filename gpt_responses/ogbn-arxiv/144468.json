The study of MSTD sets in additive number theory is also mentioned, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the construction of polar codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of non-canonical kernels, which is related to number theory (cs.NT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
