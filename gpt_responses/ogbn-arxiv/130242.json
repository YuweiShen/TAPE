The paper deals with the issue of noise type mismatch between training and testing conditions, which is a critical problem in deep-learning-based SE systems. The paper proposes a domain adversarial training approach to tackle this issue. The paper uses an encoder-decoder-based enhancement model and a domain discriminator model. The paper evaluates the proposed system on TIMIT sentences. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SD (Sound), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
