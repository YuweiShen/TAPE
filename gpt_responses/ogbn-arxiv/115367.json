The paper also proposes an efficient recovery algorithm based on semidefinite programming, which falls under the category of optimization (cs.NA). The problem of community detection is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and the paper discusses the stochastic block model, which is a common model in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
