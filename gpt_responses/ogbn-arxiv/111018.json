The paper also proposes a new method for detecting adversarial attacks, which involves optimizing the margin between class clusters in the embedding space, which could be considered a form of optimization or search algorithm (cs.AI) or a neural network architecture (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
