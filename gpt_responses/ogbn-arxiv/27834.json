The study of error-correcting codes also has applications in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also uses algebraic structures to study the codes, which could fall under discrete mathematics (cs.DS) or symbolic computation (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses a decomposition theorem to investigate the structural properties of the codes, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
