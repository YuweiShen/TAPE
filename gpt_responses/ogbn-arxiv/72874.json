The use of Deep Learning techniques such as Deep Q-Network and Deep Recurrent Q-Network suggests that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of raw image data and feature maps for navigation suggests that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of reinforcement learning for control and navigation suggests that the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
