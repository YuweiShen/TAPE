This involves both cognitive and social processes, which are key areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Therefore, cs.HCI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the explanation model and dialogue types, which are core topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computational Linguistics (CL), respectively. Hence, cs.AI and cs.CL are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the importance of secure and trustworthy communication in XAI systems, which is a concern in Cybersecurity (CYBER). Finally, the paper proposes an interaction protocol and evaluates it in a human-agent interaction study, which falls under the sub-category of Multi-Agent Systems (MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
