This involves optimizing the ANN architecture and using an innovative pre-input layer selection method, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG: The paper uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network, to predict global radiation. The authors also discuss the performance of the standalone ANN model compared to the hybrid model, which suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning techniques.\n- cs.NE: The paper uses an artificial neural network to predict global radiation, which falls under the category of neural networks and computational neuroscience.\n- cs.SD: The paper discusses a technique for forecasting global radiation using data from a numerical weather prediction model, which involves analyzing and processing large amounts of data. This could fall under the category of software development or data management.\n- cs.CE: The paper proposes a technique for predicting global radiation, which could have applications in the field of renewable energy and environmental engineering. This could fall under the category of computational engineering or scientific computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
