The nominal approach is a well-established framework for handling binding operators, which are ubiquitous in programming languages and formal systems. The use of Coq for formalisation suggests a focus on correctness and rigor. The paper also mentions algebraic techniques and combinatorics, which are relevant to several areas of computer science. Based on these considerations, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Algebraic Manipulation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
