The use of transfer learning and ensembling techniques also suggests relevance to machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL). The paper also involves classification of text-based documents, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of image datasets and deep learning models could also relate to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
