The method leverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage, and driver network concentration principles and accepts as its input a user determined combination of heterogeneous patient data, such as that available from TCGA (including mutation, copy number, and gene expression information), and creates a large number of clusters containing mutually exclusive mutated genes in a particular type of cancer. The paper also performs a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and glioblastoma data and shows that the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene modules and identifying driver genes. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), databases (cs.DB), computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
