This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper proposes a new technique to solve it. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the broadcasting of public channels and control information in wireless networks, which is a key issue in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new technique for joint beamforming and broadcasting, which involves controlling the transmission of signals to different groups of terminals. This is a problem that falls under the purview of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of information to different groups of terminals, which is a key issue in multimedia systems. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new technique for transmitting information to different groups of terminals, which involves designing efficient algorithms for joint beamforming and broadcasting. This is a problem that falls under the purview of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
