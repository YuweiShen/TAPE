The comparison with auto-encoders and the analysis of the results suggest that the paper also relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the discussion of hardware implementations and the need to address some bottlenecks in SNNs suggest a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
