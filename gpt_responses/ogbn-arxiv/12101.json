The experiments conducted are synthetic robotic experiments, which further support the relevance of this paper to the Robotics sub-category. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The proposed model is built on a dynamic vision network, which processes and integrates direct perception of dynamic visuomotor patterns. This indicates the relevance of this paper to the Computer Vision sub-category. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a deep learning approach for developing adequate coordination among different cognitive processes of a humanoid robot. This indicates the relevance of this paper to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep dynamic neural network model for end-to-end learning of direct perception of visuomotor stream. This indicates the relevance of this paper to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed model is a deep neural network model, which indicates the relevance of this paper to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
