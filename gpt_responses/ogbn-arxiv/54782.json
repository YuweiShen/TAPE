The use of mirror descent guided policy search (MDGPS) and deep learning techniques such as neural networks and convolutional neural networks suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the learned policies to deal with changes in system parameters and environmental conditions suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of simulated experiments and the evaluation of the learned policies using sensor measurements suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
