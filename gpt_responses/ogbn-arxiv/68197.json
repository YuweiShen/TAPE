The use of machine learning classifiers and feature extraction methods suggests that this paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of neural networks (FNN and CNN) suggests that this paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers suggests that this paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of ROC curve analysis suggests that this paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
