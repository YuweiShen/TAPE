Additionally, the paper mentions the use of feature extraction techniques commonly used in computer vision, such as bag-of-words and histogram of gradients.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The ODSE approach can be considered a form of artificial intelligence, and the paper proposes a classification system based on this approach.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not focus on cryptography or security, but it mentions the use of a dissimilarity measure based on the Jaccard index, which is commonly used in cryptography and security applications.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The ODSE approach involves the use of data structures and algorithms to construct a dissimilarity space and perform classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
