It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories because the authors propose a mapping from preposition senses to relation labels, which involves machine learning techniques. Information retrieval (cs.IR) and software engineering (cs.SD) are also possible sub-categories because the inventory of preposition relations could be useful for information retrieval systems and software applications that deal with natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
