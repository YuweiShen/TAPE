The problem setting involves network routing and partial observability, which are common topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper also builds on recent work in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, which falls under the category of machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves game theory and control theory, which are relevant to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
