This suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves data structures and algorithms, which are common topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses trade-offs between space and query time, which is a topic often studied in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves the construction of convex hulls, which is a classic problem in computational geometry and falls under cs.GR (Graphics) as well. Finally, the paper involves probabilistic analysis, which is a common technique in cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
