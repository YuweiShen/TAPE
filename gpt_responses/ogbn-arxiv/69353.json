The paper also discusses the effects of noise and nonlinearity in the channel, which are relevant to the fields of network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on the optical properties of the fiber, which falls under the subfield of photonics (cs.PHOTONICS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
