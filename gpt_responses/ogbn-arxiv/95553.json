The text recognition is specifically for Chinese characters, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of a synthetic data engine, which involves generating data using machine learning techniques, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed algorithm using two datasets, which involves data analysis and evaluation, making it relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
