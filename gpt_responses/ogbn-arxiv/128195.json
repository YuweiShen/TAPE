This involves training a meta-critic network that observes the learning process and meta-learns an additional loss for the actor to accelerate and improve actor-critic learning. The paper also demonstrates improvements in a variety of continuous control environments when combined with contemporary Off-PAC methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, since the paper deals with continuous control environments, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper uses deep neural networks for learning, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
