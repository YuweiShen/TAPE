The paper proposes an adaptive estimation framework and refines the minimax results of existing work. The problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and data structures (cs.DS) as it involves estimating a parameter from data. The paper also discusses the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which is a common method in statistics and machine learning, and thus may be relevant to the sub-category of statistical inference (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
