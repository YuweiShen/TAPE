The paper proposes a non-convex objective function and analyzes its properties, which are relevant to optimization and information theory. The paper also discusses the sample complexity of the proposed method, which is related to statistical inference. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
