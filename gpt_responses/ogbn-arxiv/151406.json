Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper extensively discusses the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also discusses the design challenges of implementing CEM, which could place it in the categories of cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
