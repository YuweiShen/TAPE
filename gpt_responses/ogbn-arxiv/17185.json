This is the most likely category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of WoT in robotics and examines the concepts, characteristics, and architectures of IoT-based robots. This category is likely because the paper involves information retrieval and analysis.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but it discusses the use of sensors and actions in IoT-based robots, which could involve machine learning techniques. This category is somewhat likely.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper examines the hardware, software, and communication methods of IoT-based robots, which could involve systems and control techniques. This category is somewhat likely.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of software in IoT-based robots and examines the potential of WoT in robotics.
