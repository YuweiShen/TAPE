Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely categories. Additionally, the method involves adaptive and input-driven regularization on a per-neuron basis, which is related to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper demonstrates its effectiveness on a language dataset, which could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
