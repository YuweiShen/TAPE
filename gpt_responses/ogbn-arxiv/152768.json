The paper also discusses the implications of their findings for building successful defenses, which is relevant to the subfield of computer security (cs.CR). The paper proposes a general attack strategy formulated as an optimization problem, which is relevant to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the experimental evaluation of their proposed solution strategies, which is relevant to the subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
