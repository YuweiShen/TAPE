The paper focuses on referential communication games and the input representation of raw pixel data. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of deep learning methods and neural networks, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. The use of raw pixel data as input also suggests the involvement of computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a likely sub-category. Finally, the use of reinforcement learning suggests the involvement of neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
