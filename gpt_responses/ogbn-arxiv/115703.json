It could also belong to \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) as it leverages recent findings in word embeddings research. Additionally, it could be categorized under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the automatic induction of word senses. \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with the disambiguation of word senses in corpora. Finally, \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks) is a possible sub-category as the paper models the set of ambiguous words as a complex network and uses community detection methods to cluster the obtained context embeddings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
