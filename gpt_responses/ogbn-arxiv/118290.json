The paper also uses natural language processing techniques to map teachers' descriptions to perceptual reward detectors, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper uses reinforcement learning to train the behavioural policies, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper uses visual demonstrations and images to train the agents, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
