The paper also discusses the Cognitive Radio Channel (CRC), which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses scenarios where one receiver has access to non-intended messages, which is a topic related to security and privacy (cs.SI). The paper also presents new capacity results for the basic structures, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.MM) and the study of communication networks (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
