The focus on envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) as a fairness concept suggests a connection to algorithmic mechanism design (cs.DS) and social choice theory (cs.DM). Finally, the use of algorithmic techniques and analysis of welfare suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
