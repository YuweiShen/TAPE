This work involves speech processing and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science. \n\n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category deals with sound processing and analysis, including speech processing. The paper's focus on voice conversion makes it highly relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. While the paper does not focus on these tasks, it does involve speech modeling, which is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with various machine learning techniques, including generative models. The paper proposes a novel framework using a generative adversarial network, making it highly relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.SD (Signal Processing): This sub-category deals with signal processing techniques, including speech processing. The paper's focus on voice conversion makes it relevant to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with various AI techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing.
