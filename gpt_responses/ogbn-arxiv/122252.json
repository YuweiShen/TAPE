This involves image-based rendering and computer graphics techniques, which are commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR) communities. The approach also involves training a neural network to synthesize view-dependent images, which falls under the category of deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on real and synthetic data, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
