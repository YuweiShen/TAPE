This suggests a focus on database (cs.DB) and software engineering (cs.SE) aspects of system development, as well as distributed computing (cs.DC) and deep learning (cs.DL) for managing and analyzing large amounts of data. Additionally, the paper mentions the need for traceability and discoverability in interoperability, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
