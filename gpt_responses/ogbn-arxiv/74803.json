This involves computer vision techniques such as stereo vision and the relative perspective N-point problem (PNP), as well as the use of an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to fuse prior knowledge about the wing model with real-time measurements. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
