This technique involves identifying rare branches in the code and creating a mutation mask to bias mutations towards producing inputs that hit those branches. This falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) and security (cs.CR). The paper also mentions implementing the approach on top of AFL, which is a program written in C, indicating a focus on programming languages (cs.PL). The evaluation is conducted on real-world programs, which suggests a focus on systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions conducting qualitative analysis, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
