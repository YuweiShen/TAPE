The paper also discusses information theory and coding, which suggests that it belongs to the cs.IT (Information Theory) category. The paper presents a new trade-off for the BWT-based FM-index, which involves the use of compressed partial-sums data structures, suggesting that it belongs to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) category. The paper also discusses lower bounds for symmetric data structures, which suggests that it belongs to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) category. Finally, the paper's results on locally-decodable Move-to-Front codes may be of interest to researchers in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) category, as they have applications in data compression and storage for large-scale networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
