The paper proposes a new training protocol based on self-paced learning, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the architecture of the Fast-RCNN model, which is a type of convolutional neural network used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper mentions the use of a low-capacity AlexNet network, which is a type of neural network used in deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
