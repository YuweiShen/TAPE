The use of reverse hypercontractivity and change-of-measure techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-categories. The fact that the paper deals with network communication and information exchange suggests that it may also be relevant to the networked systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the use of strong converse theorems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the learning theory (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
