This falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also proposes a stochastic search strategy that combines elements from the 20 questions approach and social learning, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of decentralized estimation with active queries can also be viewed as a control problem, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
