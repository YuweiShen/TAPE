Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new framework that uses deep learning models, which suggests that it could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with noisy data, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SD (Sound) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
