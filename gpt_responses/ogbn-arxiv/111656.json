Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper mentions the automatic analysis and understanding of natural-language texts, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of integrated information technologies and the solution of complex problems suggest the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) as possible options as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
