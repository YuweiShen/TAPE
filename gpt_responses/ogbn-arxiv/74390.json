This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed algorithm is based on comparison of actual voltage measurements with a library of signatures derived from possible topologies simulation. This involves the use of machine learning techniques and falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes an algorithm for detecting topology transitions in distribution networks, which involves software development and implementation. This falls under the domain of software engineering. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the analysis of time-series voltage measurements in distribution networks, which involves the use of networking and internet architecture concepts. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed algorithm involves the simulation of possible topologies and the comparison of actual voltage measurements with a library of signatures.
