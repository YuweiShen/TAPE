The use of causal graphs and graph classes also suggests a connection to the sub-fields of data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of acyclic causal graphs and planning instances suggests a connection to the sub-field of planning (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
