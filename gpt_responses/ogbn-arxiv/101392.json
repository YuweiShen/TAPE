The paper's goal of exploring the behavior of word embeddings on Czech language falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Word embedding methods are often based on neural network models, and the paper experiments with Word2Vec, which is a neural network-based algorithm. Therefore, cs.NE is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a new corpus for word analogy task, which involves designing efficient algorithms for solving analogical reasoning problems. Therefore, cs.DS is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
