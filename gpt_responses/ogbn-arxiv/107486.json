This paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the task of relationship type tagging between events and time in news articles. Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). It also involves the use of decision trees and parsing, which are common techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with information retrieval and text mining, which are relevant to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
