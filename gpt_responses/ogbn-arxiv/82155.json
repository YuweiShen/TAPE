The mention of multilinear and low-degree multivariate polynomials suggests a connection to algebraic complexity theory, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The mention of Fourier transformation suggests a connection to signal processing and information theory (cs.IT). The mention of similar techniques instrumental for different results suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of deterministic computation suggests a connection to control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
