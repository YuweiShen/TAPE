The paper also introduces a novel construction for reasoning about statistical divergences, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of program logic for proving differential privacy properties suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
