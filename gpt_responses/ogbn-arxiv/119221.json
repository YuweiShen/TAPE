The focus on turn-based games and parity games suggests a connection to logic and automata theory, which falls under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also introduces a new type of game called obligation games, which could fall under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The use of Markov chains and analysis of algorithms suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of p-automata, which could fall under cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
