The paper also discusses differential privacy and Byzantine resilience, which are important topics in the sub-categories of cs.CR and cs.SY. The proposed method is based on stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization algorithm in the sub-category of cs.LG. The paper also introduces novel gradient compressors, which can be related to the sub-category of cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
