The paper also discusses the use of wavelet transforms, which are commonly used in signal processing and multimedia (cs.MM). The authors propose a method for directly using compressed images in deep learning models, which involves information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of augmentation techniques to improve classification accuracy, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
