LPD communication is also relevant to wireless networks (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY) as it addresses privacy and security issues. Additionally, the paper mentions the challenges in designing practical LPD communication systems, which may involve multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
