This work involves machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks and prioritized experience replay. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with the problem of less informative reward in MARL, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of multiple agents in the proposed algorithm suggests that it belongs to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The proposed algorithm also involves robotics and control, which are covered by cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
