The paper presents lower bounds on the number of queries required to find a stable marriage, which is a fundamental algorithmic question. Hence, cs.DS is a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper presents lower bounds on the number of queries required to find a stable marriage, which is a question of computational complexity. The paper also uses techniques from communication complexity to derive the lower bounds. Hence, cs.CC is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Stable Marriage Problem is a classic problem in AI, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is a well-known algorithm for solving it. The paper deals with the analysis of the algorithm and presents lower bounds on the number of queries required to find a stable marriage. Hence, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The Stable Marriage Problem is a classic problem in game theory, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is a well-known algorithm for solving it.
