The approach of algorithm selection and optimization is also related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of optimization and selection mechanisms also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the accuracy and performance of the algorithms, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR).
