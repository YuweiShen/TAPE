The paper specifically focuses on three fundamental statistical estimation problems: phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind deconvolution, which are all subfields of computer vision and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
