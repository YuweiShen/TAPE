The proposed learning rule can be thought of as a Bayesian agent who cannot recall the priors based on which other agents make inferences. This approach preserves some aspects of Bayesian inference while being computationally tractable. Therefore, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a network of agents that communicate with each other to benefit from local observations. The proposed model involves each agent selecting one of her neighbors randomly at each time and refining her opinion using her private signal and the prior of that particular neighbor. Therefore, cs.SI is also a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the asymptotic rate of learning the truth by establishing a correspondence with a random walk on the network graph. The asymptotic rate is expressed as the sum of the relative entropies between the signal structures of every agent weighted by the stationary distribution of the random walk. Therefore, cs.IT is another likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a network of agents that aim to learn an unknown state of the world using private observations and exchange of beliefs.
