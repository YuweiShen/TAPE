Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of Reeb graphs in various applications, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also introduces a measure of similarity between Reeb graphs, which involves the use of category theory, suggesting that it could belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
