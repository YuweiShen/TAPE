The focus is on increasing the complexity of the network and coping with imperfect hardware components. This work is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including electronic design automation (cs.ET), neural networks (cs.NE), computer architecture (cs.AR), circuit design (cs.CE), and electromagnetics (cs.EM). However, given the emphasis on neuromorphic networks and memristive crossbar arrays, cs.ET and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
