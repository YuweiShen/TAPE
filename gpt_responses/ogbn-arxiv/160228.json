The paper also uses methods from circuit complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) to prove lower bounds. Additionally, the paper discusses the class of propagation-complete clause-sets, which is related to the study of logic and proof theory (cs.LO) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
