The use of block coordinate descent is a popular optimization method in this area. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses classification tasks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of large datasets implies that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
