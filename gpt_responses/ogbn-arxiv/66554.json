Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the findings in AI, robotics, and human-robot interactions, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of eye and mouse movements to analyze the strategies used in maze solving also suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the role of memory and decision-making in maze solving, which could also place it in the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
