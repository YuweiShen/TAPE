This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science subfields, including neural networks (cs.NE), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and control systems (cs.SY). Given the focus on DRL and optimization, cs.NE and cs.AI are the most likely categories. However, the paper also discusses compression techniques and distributed decision-making, which could fall under cs.IT and cs.SY, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
