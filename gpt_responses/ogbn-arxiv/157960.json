The use of R\\'enyi entropy and log-concave random vectors suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also uses mathematical tools such as the reverse Young inequality and R\\'enyi entropy comparison, which are commonly used in the sub-category of discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The study of entropy power inequalities is also relevant to the sub-category of mathematical statistics (cs.MS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI), as entropy power inequalities have applications in this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
