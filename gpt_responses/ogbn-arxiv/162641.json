This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses neural network architectures, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses the Transformer architecture, which is commonly used in NLP and could also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing).
