The paper also involves the development of a differential analysis framework, which could be considered as software engineering (cs.SE) research. The use of secure enclaves and the involvement of the operating system kernel in the attacks could also relate to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY).
