This involves using topic extraction techniques based on latent analysis and word embeddings to identify the main complications, frequently reported symptoms, and common concerns of diabetic patients. This work involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing). Additionally, the paper deals with health-related data and patient experiences, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.CY (Computers and Society). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of this work on improving the efficiency and timeliness of healthcare, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
