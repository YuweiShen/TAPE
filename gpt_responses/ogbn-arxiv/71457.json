The use of deep learning also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) categories. The alignment network and the use of affine matrices suggest that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the application of the method to lane detection on road videos suggests that it could belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
