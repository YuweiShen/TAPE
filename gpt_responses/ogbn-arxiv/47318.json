The use of learned neural network models for control suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component to the paper. The conditioning of the dynamics models on camera images indicates a computer vision (cs.CV) aspect to the work. The use of predictive models for effective gaits on different terrains suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) component. Finally, the use of neural networks for learning and control suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) aspect to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
