This involves the use of machine learning techniques and falls under the scope of cs.LG.\n- cs.CE (Computational Epidemiology): The paper deals with the patient similarity matching problem over a cancer cohort of more than 220,000 patients. This involves the use of computational methods to analyze and understand disease patterns and falls under the scope of cs.CE.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with matching patients based on their discharge code sequences, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. The use of sequential matching algorithms also falls under the scope of cs.IR.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with a large-scale dataset of more than 220,000 patients and proposes a method for case-control matching. This involves the use of database techniques for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data and falls under the scope of cs.DB.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel method for patient similarity matching using vector representations and sequential matching algorithms. This involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques and falls under the scope of cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
