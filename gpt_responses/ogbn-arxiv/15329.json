It also focuses on the evolvability of linear functions under smooth distributions. These topics are closely related to machine learning, neural networks, data structures, artificial intelligence, and information theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
