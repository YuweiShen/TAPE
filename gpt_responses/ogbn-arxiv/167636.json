The use of deep neural networks for policy design and the proposed minimax iterative dynamic game framework suggest that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on robustness against disturbances, model mismatch, or model uncertainties indicates that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
