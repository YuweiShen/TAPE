The proposed solution uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in the fields of neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the solution on a resource-constrained hardware platform, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
