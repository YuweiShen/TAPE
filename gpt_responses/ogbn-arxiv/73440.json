This is a classic problem in information theory, and hence cs.IT is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of NOMA in 5G millimeter-wave communications, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with millimeter-wave communications, which is a key technology for multimedia applications such as high-definition video streaming and virtual reality.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a suboptimal solution to a non-convex optimization problem, which involves both power allocation and beamforming. This is a classic problem in systems and control, and hence cs.SY is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal with social or ethical issues related to computing, but it does discuss a key technology (NOMA) that is likely to have a significant impact on society in the near future. Hence, cs.COM is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
