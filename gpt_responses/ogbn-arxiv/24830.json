The problem is NP-hard, so it is likely that the paper proposes algorithms that use data structures (cs.DS) and combinatorial optimization techniques (cs.DM). The paper also mentions that book drawings have applications in visualization (cs.SI) and that the authors propose a benchmark set of graph classes (cs.GR) to evaluate the performance of existing algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
