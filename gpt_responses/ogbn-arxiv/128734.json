The proposed method involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict normalization parameters, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method is for robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) tasks, specifically for 3D pose estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
