This involves the use of information theory concepts such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rate (BER). \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme is designed for wireless networks, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on enhancing physical layer security in IoT networks, which is a topic within the scope of cryptography and security. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed scheme involves the use of adaptive and robust null-space projection (AR-NSP) for beamforming, which is a control system technique. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not the primary focus, the paper mentions the use of Root Multiple Signal Classification (Root-MUSIC) algorithm for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, which is a technique used in multimedia signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
