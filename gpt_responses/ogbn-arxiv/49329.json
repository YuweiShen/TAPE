This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper deals with computing the vertices of a polyhedron defined by inequalities, which is a problem in computational geometry.\n3. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) - The paper uses symbolic computation techniques to solve the problem of checking the extremality of a point in a polyhedron.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper mentions an application to static analysis, which is a problem in systems and control.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the use of hypergraphs and the characterization of extreme points could potentially be relevant to certain machine learning problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
