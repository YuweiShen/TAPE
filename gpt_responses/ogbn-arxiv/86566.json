The use of Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) and output feedback techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of control engineering (cs.CE). The application of the proposed observer to a Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of nonlinear functions and finite-time Lyapunov principles suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
