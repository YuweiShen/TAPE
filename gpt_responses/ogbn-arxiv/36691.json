This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a unique learning method that considers purely the relationship between channels without spatial information, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
