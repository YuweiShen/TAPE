The paper deals with relation extraction from simple questions using neural networks, which is a common topic in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and ML topics. The paper also involves knowledge graphs, which are commonly used in AI (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the paper deals with finding similar questions. Finally, the paper involves working with a dataset, which is relevant to database research (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
