The network properties are used to reveal the internal corporate positioning of the three largest automotive manufacturers with respect to innovative trends and their international outlook. This falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of digital transformation on the automotive industry and how new market entrants threaten established sectors of the economy. This falls under the scope of computers and society.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses web scraping to obtain unstructured text content from web pages and applies sentiment analysis to uncover a relationship between page linking and use of positive language. This falls under the scope of information retrieval.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper presents a method to reveal hierarchical structures of unstructured text content obtained from web scraping, which could be used to gain complementary insights into innovative strategies of firms and competitive landscapes. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss computational complexity, it involves constructing and analyzing large networks, which could potentially have computational complexity implications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
