This involves the use of mobile networks with high-fidelity communication bandwidth, which is a key challenge in rural areas. The paper proposes a bandwidth-compliant criticality-aware system for transmission of massive clinical multimedia data adaptive to varying bandwidths during patient transport. The system uses model-based clinical automata to determine the criticality of clinical multimedia data and proposes physiology-aware adaptation techniques to transmit more critical clinical data with higher fidelity in response to changes in disease, clinical states, and bandwidth condition. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.OH (Other Computer Science), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
