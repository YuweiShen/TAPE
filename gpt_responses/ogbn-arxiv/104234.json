The paper also focuses on the need for secure and bug-free software in the cryptocurrency community, which suggests that it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of the Solidity language and EVM also suggests that the paper could belong to the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses techniques for producing high-quality software, which could fall under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the perception that FM increase software costs, which could suggest that it belongs to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
