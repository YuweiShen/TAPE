The use of continuation optimization is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) that is applied to improve the training of MIL models. The paper also discusses the discovery of Stable Semantic Extremal Regions (SSERs), which is related to object recognition and classification (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments are conducted on image datasets (cs.MM) and the paper discusses the use of smoothed loss functions, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
