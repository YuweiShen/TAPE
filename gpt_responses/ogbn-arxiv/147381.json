However, the focus on wireless channels and the use of deterministic models suggest that the paper is most likely to be classified under Information Theory (cs.IT), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of local sources of randomness and the Alice-Bob-Eve setting, which are concepts that are relevant to System and Control (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) subfields, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
