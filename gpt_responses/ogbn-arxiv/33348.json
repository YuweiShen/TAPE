The proposed algorithm is based on the difference of convex functions algorithm (DCA), which is a popular optimization technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm is applied to sparse metrics, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also includes numerical examples and experiments, which involve numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
