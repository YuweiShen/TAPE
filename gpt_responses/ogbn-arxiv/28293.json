This involves the use of machine learning techniques to reduce the manual labelling efforts. The paper also introduces an open-source tool for collaborative and machine-aided annotations. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are: \n\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on the interaction between humans and machines in the context of social signal annotation. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with the processing of natural language in the context of social signals. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves the analysis of visual signals in the context of social signals. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to reduce manual labelling efforts. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to speed up the annotation process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
