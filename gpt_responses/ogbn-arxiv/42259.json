The paper also discusses communication efficiency and network topology, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The privacy-aware aspect of the proposed algorithm suggests that it may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
