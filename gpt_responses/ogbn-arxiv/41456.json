The focus of the paper is on data reduction algorithms for preprocessing the input graphs to make the problem more tractable. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), game theory (cs.GT), or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
