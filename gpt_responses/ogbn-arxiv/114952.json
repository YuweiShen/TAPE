The problem also involves finding a median point, which is a common task in clustering and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents a Monte Carlo algorithm, which is a technique often used in randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
