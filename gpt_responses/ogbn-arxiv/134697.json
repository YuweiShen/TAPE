The specific type of signal-dependent noise considered in the paper is relevant to molecular and optical communication, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of additive Gaussian signal-dependent noise channels, which is relevant to signal processing and communication engineering (cs.SI, cs.NI, cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
