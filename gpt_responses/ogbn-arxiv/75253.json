The use of i.i.d. random variables suggests a connection to probability theory and statistics, which are also relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper's focus on correlation and partial sums may also make it relevant to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category.
