The paper proposes a new formulation that maximizes the $\\ell^4$-norm over the orthogonal group to learn the entire dictionary. This formulation is related to optimization and linear algebra, which are core topics in computer science. The paper also provides strong theoretical guarantees and experimental results on real images, which suggest that the paper is likely to be submitted to the machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), or signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories of arXiv CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
