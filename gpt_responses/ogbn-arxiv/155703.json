The paper also discusses the role of noise in making the long-term behavior of a system computationally tractable, which relates to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of statistical measures to describe the behavior of dynamical systems, which is a topic in both machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
