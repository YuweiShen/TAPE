The paper proposes a deep and shallow feature learning network for efficient online tracking. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as feature learning and channel reliability measurement, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with video processing and real-time tracking, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
