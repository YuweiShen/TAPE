This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision sub-category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions a wearable system and testing the performance of visual localization under practical scenarios, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the robotics sub-category.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on improving the navigational assistance for visually impaired people, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the human-computer interaction sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may also belong to the machine learning sub-category as it proposes a robust and efficient visual localization algorithm that takes advantage of priori GNSS signals and multi-modal images.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses multiple image descriptors to achieve accurate localization, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
