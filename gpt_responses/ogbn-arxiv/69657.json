The paper proposes an online feature selection system that can handle big data, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of large-scale machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of automated negotiation, which is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper deals with decision-making and classification, which are common topics in data science (cs.DS). The paper also mentions real-world applications, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
