Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel framework for weakly supervised segmentation, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning and active learning. Hence, it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of adapting autonomous driving systems to different environments, which involves security and privacy concerns. Therefore, it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
