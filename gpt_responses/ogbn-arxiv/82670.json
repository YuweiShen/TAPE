It proposes a novel method based on Preferential based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) to guide the agent towards the end goal. The paper also discusses the extension of the current imitation framework to new horizons, including continuous-to-discrete action imitation and primitive-to-macro action imitation. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
