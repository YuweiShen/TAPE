The paper also discusses machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) and their performance in software quality prediction. The use of Deb's principle of $\\epsilon$-dominance suggests a focus on optimization and decision-making (cs.AI). The paper also mentions defect prediction methods, which falls under software development (cs.SD). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for simplification in software quality predictors, which could involve programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
