Additionally, the paper proposes a new training algorithm for TTS models, which is a common topic in the cs.CL sub-category. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the cs.SD (Sound) sub-category as it deals with generating speech audio. \n\nThe use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the proposed algorithm suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on addressing the exposure bias in autoregressive module training suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which deals with the development of intelligent agents that can learn from data. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of GANs to equalize the difference between real and predicted data suggests that it may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category, which deals with the development of systems that can learn and adapt to changing environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
