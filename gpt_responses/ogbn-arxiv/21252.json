Therefore, cs.SP (Signal Processing) is a likely category. The paper also uses tools from information theory, such as finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) sampling, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as another likely category. The paper also involves computational geometry, as it deals with signals on a geometric object, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as a possible category. The paper also applies the proposed algorithm to sound source localization, which is a problem in computer vision and machine learning, suggesting cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with applications of the proposed algorithm, such as shot noise removal and diffusion processes, which suggests cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
