The use of Cloud providers and virtualization is also a key aspect of the paper, which could place it in the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems) or operating systems (cs.OS). Finally, the paper also touches on scalability and optimization of computing resources, which could relate to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
