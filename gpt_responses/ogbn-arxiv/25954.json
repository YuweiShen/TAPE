The paper proposes a new approach to incorporate prior information about the block support into regularization-based block-sparse recovery, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions simulations on both synthetic and real data, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
