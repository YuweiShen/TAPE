Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes using decoder pre-training and back-translation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and deep learning, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses multilingual datasets, which could involve image captioning or other visual tasks, suggesting cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
