The approach involves no learning, but rather analytical design decisions, which could also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also proposes a novel feature pooling technique, which could be of interest to the machine learning community (cs.LG, cs.NE). Finally, the paper applies the proposed approach to dynamic texture recognition, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
