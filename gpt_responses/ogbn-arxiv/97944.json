Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of interference on network performance, which is related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely sub-category. The use of massive MIMO and cooperative relay networks also suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SI (Signal Processing) could be relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses stochastic geometry to analyze the networks, which could fall under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
