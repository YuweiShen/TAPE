It also presents findings based on a study investigating the limits of zero-interaction security (ZIS) - a novel concept, leveraging sensor data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices to pair or authenticate devices. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
