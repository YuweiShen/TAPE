This problem falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem in different scenarios, which involves optimization and algorithms (cs.MM). The study of mutual information and optimal precoding can also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and complexity theory, which can be classified under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
