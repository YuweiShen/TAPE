It could also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category as it addresses security concerns in network file systems. Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) is another possible category as the paper deals with file system operations in a distributed environment. Operating Systems (cs.OS) is also a likely category as the paper discusses the implementation of FileWall for the NFS protocol. Finally, Software Engineering (cs.SE) is a possible category as the paper presents a solution for implementing context-aware access policies without modifying clients or servers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
