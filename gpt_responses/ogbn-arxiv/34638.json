This problem is a generalization of many classical graph problems, such as Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, and Odd Cycle Transversal. The paper uses techniques from parameterized complexity theory to show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) and admits a polynomial kernel, for any fixed constant $\\alpha$. The paper also shows that the problem is W[1]-hard for $\\alpha \\in O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
