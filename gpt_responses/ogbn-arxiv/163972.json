It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as pose tracking is an important problem in robotics. The use of a Transformer-based network for binary classification suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper's focus on real-time tracking may suggest it belongs to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of benchmarks and evaluation metrics suggests it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
