This problem is commonly studied in the data mining (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. The paper also discusses approximation ratios, which are a common topic in theoretical computer science (cs.THE). Additionally, the paper involves optimization algorithms, which are relevant to the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
