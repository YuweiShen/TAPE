The manipulation, bribery, and control problems mentioned in the abstract also suggest the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the study of election systems can also fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
