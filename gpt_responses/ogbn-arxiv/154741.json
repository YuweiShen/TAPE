This is a core problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a framework for learning first-order symbolic representations for planning from the structure of the state space, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG), planning (cs.PL), natural language processing (cs.CL), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
