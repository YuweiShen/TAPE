The paper also involves optimization of power allocation and cooperative jamming, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses numerical simulations to evaluate the proposed schemes, which could be considered as a multimedia application (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
