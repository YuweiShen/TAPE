This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including network infrastructure (cs.NI), cryptography and security (cs.CR), information theory (cs.IT), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). However, given the focus on cellular networks and wireless communication, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
