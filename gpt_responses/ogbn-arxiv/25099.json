The proposed method involves the use of deep neural networks, which falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the security implications of face recognition systems, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves the use of data augmentation techniques, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
