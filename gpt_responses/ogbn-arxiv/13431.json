Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and achievable sum-rate are also discussed. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of a cost-effective 5G wireless system with large MIMO using lens antenna arrays. The proposed PDMA scheme can also be applied in wireless networks to improve multi-user communication efficiency. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint design of analog beamforming at the MSs and digital combining at the BS to maximize the achievable sum-rate of the MSs based on their effective MIMO channels. This involves system optimization and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of millimeter wave communication for 5G wireless systems, which can support high-speed multimedia applications. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes the use of a full-dimensional (FD) lens antenna array at the base station (BS) and conventional uniform planar array (UPA) at the mobile stations (MSs) for a cost-effective millimeter wave MIMO system. The hardware architecture of the proposed system is discussed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
