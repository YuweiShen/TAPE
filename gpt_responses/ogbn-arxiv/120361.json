The use of weighted automata on infinite words also suggests a connection to formal language theory (cs.FL) and algorithms for manipulating infinite data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of undecidability hints at a potential connection to computational complexity theory and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
