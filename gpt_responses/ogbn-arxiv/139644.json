The use of structured mappings and joint-source channel coding also suggests a possible connection to Multimedia (cs.MM) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The problem of communication with feedback is also relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of random unstructured mappings/codes, which could be of interest to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
