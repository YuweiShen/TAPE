Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper presents theoretical complexity analysis and practical efficiency evaluation, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
