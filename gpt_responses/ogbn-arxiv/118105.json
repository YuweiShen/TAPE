The paper also uses coinductive definitions, which are commonly used in the study of formal languages and automata, placing it in the realm of theoretical computer science. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.LT (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
