This involves the use of wireless communication technologies and network infrastructure, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the technical challenges in designing high spectral efficient scheduling and resource allocation schemes, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and computer engineering (cs.CE).
