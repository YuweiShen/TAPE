The paper also discusses the impact of noise correlation and channel phase information, which could be considered as topics related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also proposes new codes and derives upper bounds on their data rate, which could be considered as topics related to coding theory and error correction (cs.CE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
