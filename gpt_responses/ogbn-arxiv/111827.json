Specifically, the paper studies these data structures in newer models of distributed computation such as the Congested Clique model and the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which are subfields of Distributed Computing. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the tradeoffs between various complexity measures, which is a topic that falls under the category of Data Management (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of hopsets, which is a topic that falls under the category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the application of the results to the streaming model, which is a subfield of Streaming (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
