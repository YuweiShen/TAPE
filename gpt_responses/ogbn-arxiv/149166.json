Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses parallelizing finite state algorithms on GPUs, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses achieving decoding speedups, which is a topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning). The implementation of the Viterbi and forward-backward algorithm involves data structures and algorithms, which is a topic in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the use of OpenFST, which is a tool for manipulating finite-state transducers, and therefore falls under the category of cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
