This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Programming Languages (cs.PL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on extending existing session type theories to improve the integration mechanism, which suggests a stronger connection to cs.PL and cs.SE. However, the use of process calculi and the analysis of key properties also indicate relevance to cs.LO and cs.SY, while the discussion of distributed systems points towards cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
