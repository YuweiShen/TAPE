This involves the use of hardware acceleration, which falls under the category of computer architecture and embedded systems (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the Levenshtein distance computation kernel, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the CAPI interface for cache coherence, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
