The paper also discusses the use of learning-based methods, which suggests that it could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the application of the proposed techniques to an autonomous convoy of vehicles, which suggests that it could be relevant to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of convex optimization problems, which suggests that it could be relevant to optimization and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
