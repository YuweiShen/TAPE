The proposed network utilizes a fully convolutional network and two localization networks, which are specialized for localizing objects with different scales, to improve the localization accuracy. This involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.AI), and the use of ensemble methods (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational cost of the proposed method, which could be of interest to researchers in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on several datasets, which could be of interest to researchers in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
