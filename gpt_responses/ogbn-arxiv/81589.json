It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it uses a deep U-Net with residual connections and a novel hybrid deep supervision scheme for multi-task learning. Additionally, it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as mammograms are a type of medical image. It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves the development of an intelligent system for mammogram analysis. Finally, it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it involves the extraction of information from medical images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
