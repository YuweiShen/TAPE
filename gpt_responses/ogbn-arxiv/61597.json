The paper proposes novel algorithms for joint inference of the network topology and processes from partial nodal observations using structural models for graph processes. The paper also discusses the use of Kalman smoothing and online joint inference for delay-sensitive applications. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
