The paper also discusses the use of coherence parameter for uniform and non-uniform recovery, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of discrete-cosine transform (DCT) domain, which is a common technique in image and video processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
