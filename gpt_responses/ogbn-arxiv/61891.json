The paper discusses machine reading comprehension (MRC) and the use of heuristics to split datasets into easy and hard subsets. This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which are covered by cs.CL and cs.AI. The study also involves examining the performance of baseline models, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the study investigates the reasoning skills required for answering different types of MRC questions, which could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and cognitive science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
