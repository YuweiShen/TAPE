The use of designs in coding theory also makes it relevant to the sub-category of coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the properties of the codes used, which may be of interest to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the construction of designs involves solving systems of equations, which falls under the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
