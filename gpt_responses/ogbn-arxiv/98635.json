This work is related to the field of analog and mixed-signal circuits (cs.ET), as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning (cs.AR, cs.NE). The proposed model and circuits are designed for energy efficiency (cs.CE) and can be applied to various types of neural network structures (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
