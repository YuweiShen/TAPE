The paper also uses formal methods such as Differential Dynamic Logic (dL) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), which are commonly used in the sub-fields of logic (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the issue of safety in a dynamic environment, which is relevant to the sub-field of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a compositional design approach, which is related to the sub-field of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
