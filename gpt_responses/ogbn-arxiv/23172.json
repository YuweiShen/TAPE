Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) categories. The paper also proposes a novel Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching (RCM) approach that uses reinforcement learning (RL), which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the paper deals with navigation in physical environments, which falls under the Robotics (cs.RO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
