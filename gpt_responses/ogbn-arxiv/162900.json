Additionally, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as these fields are closely related to natural language processing and neural network models. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a new objective function for neural models. Finally, cs.SD (Sound) is a less likely sub-category as it is not directly related to the topic of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
