The use of antenna arrays and the need for efficient computation also suggest that it could fall under the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiuser MIMO techniques, which could relate to multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
