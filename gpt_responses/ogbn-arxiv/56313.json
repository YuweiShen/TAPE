It also involves experiments on simulated datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is a common practice in the field of machine learning. \n\nIt could also belong to \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision) as deep learning models are widely used in computer vision tasks, and the proposed approach could potentially improve the robustness of such models under noisy supervision. \n\nAdditionally, it could be categorized under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) as deep learning is a subfield of AI, and the proposed approach could contribute to the development of more robust AI systems. \n\n\"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with training neural networks, which is a core topic in this field. \n\nFinally, \"cs.CR\" (Cryptography and Security) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not explicitly address security or privacy concerns, but it could be relevant if the proposed approach is applied to secure or private machine learning scenarios."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
