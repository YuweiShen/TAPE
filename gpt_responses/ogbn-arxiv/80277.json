Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves generating a large-scale multi-view set of correspondences for training the network, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of a new loss function to train a deep network suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with processing images, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
