The algorithm involves using diffusion geometry to characterize cluster cores, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of spatial regularization, which is a common technique in both computer vision and machine learning (cs.AI). The algorithm involves sampling from estimated cluster cores, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the algorithm on real hyperspectral images, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
