The use of tailored loss functions and generative models also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of dynamic images as a representation of human motion suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
