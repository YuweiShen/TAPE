The paper also discusses the use of different loss functions and computational efficiency, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of depth-wise separable convolution and nearest neighbor interpolation are techniques commonly used in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
