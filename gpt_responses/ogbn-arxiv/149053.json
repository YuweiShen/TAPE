The paper proposes two contributions to improve the scene composition, which involves using heuristic-based relations and extreme points representation. These methods are based on machine learning (ML) techniques, which fall under the category of artificial intelligence (AI). The paper also discusses how scene graphs can be used for retrieval tasks, which is related to information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM). Finally, the paper involves optimizing the scene graph representation, which is a problem in graph theory (GR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.GR, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
