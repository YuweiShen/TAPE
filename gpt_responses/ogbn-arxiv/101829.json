This topic is closely related to robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the errors that emerge from object recognition trials in a real-world robotic scenario, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
