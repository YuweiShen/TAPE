The paper discusses the limitations of CNN-based absolute camera pose regression and proposes a theoretical model to understand the behavior of these techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the applications of visual localization in self-driving cars and SLAM, which are related to robotics, making cs.RO (Robotics) another likely sub-category. The paper proposes a theoretical model to understand the behavior of CNN-based techniques, which suggests that it is related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of CNN-based techniques compared to handcrafted image retrieval, which suggests that it is related to computer vision and pattern recognition, making cs.CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a likely sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
