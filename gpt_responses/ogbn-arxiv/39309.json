The paper also proposes algorithms for optimizing transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of these algorithms in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers, which is a topic related to communication and networking (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
