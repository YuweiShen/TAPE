This work involves networking, artificial intelligence, and data structures. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the use of rule-based reasoning and the evaluation of caching strategies suggest that this paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach in terms of security and performance could also place this paper in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
