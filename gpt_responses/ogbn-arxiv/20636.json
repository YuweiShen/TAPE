The use of data augmentation and Bayesian optimization also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves neural networks, which could place it in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
