The paper also discusses the use of algebraic expressions to generate a physical representation of data, which is related to the field of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the architecture of RodentStore and its interface with other parts of a database system, which falls under the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also discusses the potential performance gains of using RodentStore, which is related to the field of cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper discusses the use of RodentStore in representing dense geospatial data collected from a mobile sensor network, which is related to the field of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
