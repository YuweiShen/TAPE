The paper also uses specially designed environments to control for specific factors that affect performance, such as reward sparsity and perceptual complexity, which are relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper deals with deep nonlinear models, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
