Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.BIO (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics). The paper also proposes a lightweight method for computing the LCP and BWT of large sequence collections, which involves compression techniques and information theory, suggesting possible relevance to cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
