This is a common problem in machine learning, and the proposed solution is applicable to a wide range of tasks, including image classification, CNN fine-tuning, and RNN training. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
