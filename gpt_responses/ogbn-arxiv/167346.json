The paper also proposes a new method that improves the efficiency of an existing method, which involves machine learning techniques such as discriminatively learned correlation filters and ridge regression, so it is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
