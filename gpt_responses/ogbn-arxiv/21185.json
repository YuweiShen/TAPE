The use of approximation algorithms and the mention of NP-hardness suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of planar graph classes suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the mention of word clouds and semantically related words suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
