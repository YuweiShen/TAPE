This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses techniques from computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR) to prove the lower bounds. Additionally, the paper deals with matrices and submatrices, which are commonly studied in the field of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
