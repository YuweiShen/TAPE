The use of deterministic epsilon-steps and the comparison to the work of Senizergues suggest a connection to parsing and language theory (cs.PL). The regularity problem and the extension to nondeterministic PDA indicate a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and automata theory (cs.LT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
