The paper also mentions fine-grained complexity arguments, which is a subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper discusses problems related to geometric algorithms, such as planar nearest neighbors, which falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also mentions reductions from dynamic OV to other problems, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses algorithmic consequences of dynamic OV being easy in the cell-probe model, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
