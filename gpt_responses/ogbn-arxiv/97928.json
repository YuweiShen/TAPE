This involves the use of machine learning techniques and falls under the domain of cs.AI. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The use of neural graph computation in FASum also falls under the domain of cs.LG, which deals with the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses the evaluation of summarization systems using a factual correctness evaluator, which is a measure of the relevance and accuracy of the information presented in the summary. This falls under the domain of cs.IR, which deals with the retrieval and analysis of information from large datasets. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - The use of neural graph computation in FASum also falls under the domain of cs.NE, which deals with the development of neural network models for various applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
