The paper also discusses applications in supervised learning and dynamical systems, which are both areas of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of risk-sensitive Markov Decision Processes suggests a connection to control theory (cs.SY), and the use of stochastic gradient methods suggests a connection to stochastic processes and optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
