This involves designing a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves optimization and decision-making, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
