The use of hypergraphical sources and finite linear sources suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of discrete structures (cs.DS) and scientific computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of capacity, which is a concept in communication complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
