This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computer science that deal with information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), data mining (cs.DL), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Among these, cs.DL is the most likely category as the paper discusses the use of supervised machine learning for automatic feature selection. The other sub-categories are also relevant as they deal with the analysis of text and networks, which are important for identifying academic influence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
