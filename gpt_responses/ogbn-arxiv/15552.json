Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also involves programming language/proof assistant Agda, which suggests it could also belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.SE (Software Engineering). The use of natural numbers in the demonstration of the decision procedure suggests it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
