This problem falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of pre-coding, which is a technique used in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also deals with the transmission of common and private messages, which is a topic in source coding (cs.SI). The paper also involves the use of inner bounds, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the transmission of messages to multiple receivers, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
