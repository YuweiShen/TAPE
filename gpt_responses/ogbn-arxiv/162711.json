This involves the deployment of a large number of access points (APs) instead of large co-located massive MIMO arrays. This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-disciplines, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for the development of power allocation and user scheduling strategies. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
