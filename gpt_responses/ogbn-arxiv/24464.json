The use of object detection and click-supervision also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on different datasets, indicating the relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
