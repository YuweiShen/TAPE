The paper also mentions a trainable model, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of appearance evidence and graph likelihoods, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also mentions benchmark face datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of norm minimization and regularization, which are common in information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
