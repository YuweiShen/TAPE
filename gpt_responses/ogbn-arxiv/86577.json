This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational approach to enhance existing thermostats for energy-efficient control of ACs. This falls under the domain of computational engineering.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of advanced features such as monitoring the fitness level of ACs to provide actionable and corrective feedback to users. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of grey-box modeling techniques, which can be considered a form of machine learning, to enhance existing thermostats for energy-efficient control of ACs.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the reduction of occupants' discomfort by 23% when maximising the user experience, which falls under the domain of human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
