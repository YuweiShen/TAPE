The approach involves using static analysis and machine learning techniques, which are also relevant to software engineering (cs.SE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of a new approximate signature matching algorithm, which could be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
