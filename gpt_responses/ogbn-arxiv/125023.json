The use of cryptographic techniques and a tamper-proof ledger also suggests a focus on security and data management, which are common themes in the cs.CR and cs.DB sub-categories. The use of statistical tests and evaluation on real and synthetic datasets suggests a focus on machine learning and data analysis, which are common themes in the cs.LG and cs.DS sub-categories.
