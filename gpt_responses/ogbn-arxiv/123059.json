The use of $\\ell_1$ loss suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of compressed sensing (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the entropy of distributions, which is a concept that is studied in probability theory and statistics (cs.ST). Finally, the paper draws connections to other areas of adaptive estimation, which may fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
