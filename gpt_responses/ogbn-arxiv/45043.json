It also mentions the use of well-known datasets for testing, which is a common practice in the computer vision field. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of hyperparameters and the risk of overfitting, which suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of metrics to measure inter-class separability and intra-class compactness indicates that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe mention of time-consumption in the experimental results suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as multimedia applications often require real-time processing. \n\nFinally, the use of a single adjustable constant for intra-class compactness control suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category, as this is a common technique in neural network optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
