The use of Selective Mapping (SLM) technique and nested lattice codes suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). The mention of trellis precoding framework indicates a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
