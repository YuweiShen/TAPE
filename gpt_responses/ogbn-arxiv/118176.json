The physical processes being studied involve partial differential equations (PDEs), which are commonly used in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA). The paper also mentions the use of sparse regression and regularization, which are common techniques in statistics and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of linear programming and block parallel algorithms, which are topics in optimization and distributed computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
