The paper proposes a novel approach to model the static artefacts in a scene and using these to predict the dynamic trajectories. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning models for unsupervised feature learning, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper deals with predicting abnormal events, which suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with navigation systems, which suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a sequence to sequence model coupled with a soft attention mechanism, which suggests that it could belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
