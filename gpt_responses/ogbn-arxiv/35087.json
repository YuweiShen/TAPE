The applications of deep RL in healthcare, robotics, and smart grids suggest that it may also fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of deep RL in computer vision (cs.CV) is becoming increasingly popular, making it another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
