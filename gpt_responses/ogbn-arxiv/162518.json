The use of excluded minors as a restricted family of graphs suggests that the paper may fall under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) or graph theory (cs.GT). The mention of local algorithms and distributed settings suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the use of sparsity constraints and the analysis of distances between vertices suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
