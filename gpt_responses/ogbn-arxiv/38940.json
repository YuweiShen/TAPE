This falls under the domain of information theory and communication systems, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.IT and cs.COMM. The paper also discusses the use of lattice codes, which are commonly used in signal processing and control systems, covered by the sub-categories cs.SY and cs.NI. Finally, the paper mentions the threshold effect in non-linear modulation systems, which is a topic in multimedia processing and communication, covered by the sub-category cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
