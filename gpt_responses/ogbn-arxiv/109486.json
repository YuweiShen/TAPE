This technique involves unfolding additional dimensions only if certain criteria are met in an observation, which makes the ontology of the input hierarchical in nature. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category, as it deals with the interaction patterns for selecting or highlighting polylines. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of PC for two different datasets, one related to AutoML hyperparameter search log and the other related to session results from a conversational agent, which suggests that it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Database (cs.DB), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
