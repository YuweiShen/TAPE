This problem is a classic topic in the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Robotics (RO), which are covered by the arXiv sub-categories cs.MA and cs.RO, respectively. The paper also discusses the use of logical predicates to formally describe the algorithm and its correctness, which is related to the sub-category cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of removing the chirality restriction in PF, which involves symmetry and group theory, and is related to the sub-categories cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
