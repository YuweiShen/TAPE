The proposed method involves using two network branches with different designs to extract rotation-sensitive and rotation-invariant features for classification and regression tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which covers topics related to image processing and analysis. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
