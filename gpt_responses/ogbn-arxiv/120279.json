The paper proposes a method for transferring appearance and retargeting human motion from monocular videos that takes into account body shape, appearance, and motion constraints. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with motion estimation and shape modeling, which are also relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also mentions view synthesis and image-to-image translation, which are relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper proposes a unifying formulation for transferring appearance and retargeting human motion, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the proposed method, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
