The paper discusses the challenges of scalability, preventing misuse of credentials, and managing insiders. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the design of a highly-available and dynamically-scalable system, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The implementation of the system on the Google Cloud Platform involves software engineering and system design, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
