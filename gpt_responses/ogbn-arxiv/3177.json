The study of cognitive biases in auctions is also relevant to behavioral economics (cs.DS). The paper specifically focuses on the existence of Walrasian equilibria, which is a central concept in microeconomics and auction theory (cs.EC). Finally, the paper uses LP relaxations and local maxima, which are techniques commonly used in optimization and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
