The use of a novel CNN based deep regression network also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the system. The system also supports gesture based interactions, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses user studies and numerical results, indicating the use of machine learning (cs.LG) for evaluation and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
