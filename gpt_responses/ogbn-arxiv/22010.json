The use of incentives and game theory to manage user behavior is also a key aspect of this paper, which suggests the categories of game theory (cs.GT) and information theory (cs.IT). The consideration of different classes of applications with different delay sensitivities suggests the category of signal processing (cs.SI), while the study of constant and dynamic demand levels suggests the category of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
