It could also belong to cs.SD (Sound) as it deals with audio processing. The use of deep learning models such as ResNet and CNNs suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of Grid-RNNs suggests that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
