The paper also discusses the use of $D^2$-sampling, which is a common technique in the field of data mining (cs.DM). The paper's focus on streaming algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of distributed computing (cs.DC) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
