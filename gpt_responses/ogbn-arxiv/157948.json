This problem is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) as it requires the development of efficient optimization procedures and algorithms to accurately estimate poses. Additionally, the paper involves the use of integer programming and column generation techniques, which are relevant to discrete optimization (cs.GR) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
