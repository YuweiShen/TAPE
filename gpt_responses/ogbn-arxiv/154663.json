This involves using a probabilistic model to represent the cost function and iteratively updating its parameters based on the difference between the observed and synthesized trajectories. This approach is closely related to energy-based models, which are commonly used in machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also applies the proposed method to autonomous driving tasks, which suggests a possible connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
