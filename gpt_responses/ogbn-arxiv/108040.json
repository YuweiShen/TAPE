The paper discusses the limitations of existing evaluation metrics and benchmarks that focus mainly on the geometric accuracy of the reconstructed model. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Graphics (cs.GR), and Geometric Topology (cs.GT) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the approach on a range of methods, including standard geometry-plus-texture pipelines as well as image-based rendering techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
