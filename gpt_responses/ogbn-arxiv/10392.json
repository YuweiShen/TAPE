It also discusses the use of coding schemes to approach the theoretical achievable rate pairs, which falls under the category of network coding and information theory (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of BCJR algorithm, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI). The numerical results involve computing mutual information rates for Gaussian interference channels with embedded convolutional codes, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
