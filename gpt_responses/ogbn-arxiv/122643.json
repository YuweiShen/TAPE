The paper also focuses on planar and bounded-genus graphs, which are important classes of graphs in computational geometry and topology. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The paper also involves combinatorial optimization and parameterized complexity, which suggest cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
