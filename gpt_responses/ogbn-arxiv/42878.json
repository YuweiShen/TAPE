The use of mixed integer programming and convex concave constraints suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) categories. The application of the technique to computational social choice problems suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories.
