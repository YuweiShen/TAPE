This problem is related to compressed sensing (cs.SP) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses convex relaxation and optimization techniques (cs.LG) and applies them to image processing (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions invariance to circular shifts and reflections, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
