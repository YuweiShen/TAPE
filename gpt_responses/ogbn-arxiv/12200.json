This falls under the scope of logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper makes use of the Lean metaprogramming framework to verify certain Mathematica computations. This involves programming language concepts such as reflection and translation.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper deals with the exchange of arbitrary information between Lean and Mathematica, which are both systems for symbolic computation.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents an interface between two software systems and discusses how to extend it in a flexible manner. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper does not explicitly discuss data structures and algorithms, but the connection between Lean and Mathematica involves the manipulation and transformation of mathematical expressions, which can be seen as a form of algorithmic computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
