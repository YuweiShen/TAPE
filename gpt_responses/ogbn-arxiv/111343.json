The paper also discusses alternative pooling strategies for CNN features, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper evaluates a novel dataset, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper uses natural language processing techniques to describe the experiments and results, which could fall under computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
