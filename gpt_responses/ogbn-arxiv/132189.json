It also involves the study of self-dual codes and their hulls, which are important in cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.IT). The paper uses techniques from algebraic geometry and combinatorics, which are relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the construction of generator matrices and Gray maps, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SD) and coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
