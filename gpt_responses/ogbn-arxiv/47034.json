This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with the estimation of camera poses and scene geometry for navigation purposes. The visual part of the system involves direct minimization of photometric error, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of measurement preintegration and inclusion of scale and gravity direction in the model are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY), respectively. Finally, the optimization of variables such as poses and scale involves the use of optimization algorithms, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
