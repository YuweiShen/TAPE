The problem also involves graph theory (cs.DS) as it deals with directed graphs. The paper presents exact and heuristic algorithms, which are related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DM). The problem of placing arrow heads in directed graph drawings is also related to graph theory (cs.GT) as it deals with the representation of graphs. Finally, the paper reports on a practical study, which is related to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
