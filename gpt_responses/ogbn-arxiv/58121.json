The closed-form expression of a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity is also derived. These topics are closely related to information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on enhancing physical layer security of wireless communications, which is a core topic in cryptography and security. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme is designed for wireless communications, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an optimization of transmission power allocation to enhance the secrecy capacity, which can be viewed as a control problem. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed scheme can potentially be applied to secure transmission of multimedia data in wireless communications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
