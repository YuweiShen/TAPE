It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a learning framework for training SNNs. Additionally, since the proposed framework is applied to image classification tasks, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the focus is on efficient and rapid inference, it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
