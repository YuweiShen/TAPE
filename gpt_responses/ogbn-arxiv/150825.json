The paper specifically focuses on image recognition tasks, which suggests that it could also fall under \"Computer Vision\" (cs.CV). The proposed approach involves selecting optimal paths for new tasks, which could be related to \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). The paper also mentions knowledge distillation and retrospection, which could be related to \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
