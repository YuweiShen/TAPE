The paper also mentions the use of Hadamard matrices, which are commonly used in coding theory and signal processing, as well as in computational geometry (cs.CG). The problem of transferring an n-dimensional Lee sphere into a small box involves geometric considerations and may be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) or numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the construction of perfect codes with minimum distance four may be of interest to researchers in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
