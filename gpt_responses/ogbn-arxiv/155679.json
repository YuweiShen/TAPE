The paper proposes a method for automatic control synthesis, which involves the use of logic-based formalisms such as Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL), indicating a connection to the field of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with the problem of satisfying individual task specifications as well as team global task specifications, which involves the use of logical reasoning and planning, indicating a connection to the field of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper proposes a systematic procedure for control synthesis, which involves the use of algorithms and optimization techniques, indicating a connection to the field of cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of timed constraints, which involves the use of temporal logic and formal verification techniques, indicating a connection to the field of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
