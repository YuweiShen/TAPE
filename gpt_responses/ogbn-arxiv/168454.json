The paper also mentions the use of formal methods for capturing stimulus-response requirements, which could be related to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of program provers for checking candidate programs against stated requirements, which could be related to formal methods (cs.FL) and emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
