This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a regularization term to improve the content-invariance of the mapping codes learned by the GAEs, which involves penalizing the symmetric cross-reconstruction error. This regularization term is related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with 3D object rotation, which is related to computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
