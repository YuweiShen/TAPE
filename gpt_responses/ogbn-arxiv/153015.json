The paper proposes a new pipeline design for SDN that provides fast reroute of traffic flows in case of failures, and it discusses the implementation and experimental validation of the proposed design. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also deals with fault detection and recovery, which are important topics in computer security. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. \n\nThe proposed pipeline design involves switches' periodic link probing and fast reroute of traffic flows, which are topics related to control systems. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a new pipeline design for SDN, which involves stateful data plane abstractions such as OpenState or Open vSwitch. Therefore, it may also belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the implementation and experimental validation of the proposed design, which involves programming and software development. Therefore, it may also belong to the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
