The use of anti-aliasing filters is also a common technique in signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the design of optimal filters, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of statistical assumptions to bound the information loss, which is a topic in statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
