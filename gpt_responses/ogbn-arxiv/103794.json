Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel objectness criterion, which involves ranking candidate boxes based on their gradients, indicating a machine learning component, making it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with visual objects, making it possible to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
