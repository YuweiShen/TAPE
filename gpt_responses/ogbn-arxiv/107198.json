The paper proposes a new method for robust matrix completion that can recover a low-rank matrix from a few corrupted coefficients with respect to a general basis. This problem is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, since the paper focuses on matrix completion and subspace recovery, we believe that cs.IT and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CV, cs.NA, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
