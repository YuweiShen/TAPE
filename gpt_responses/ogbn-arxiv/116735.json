This problem is closely related to difficult problems from information theory, which suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.IT. However, the paper specifically focuses on databases and functional dependencies, which are topics related to cs.DB. The paper also provides a precise characterization of the bound in terms of finite groups, which could be relevant to cs.DS. Additionally, the paper uses entropy vectors, which are a tool commonly used in machine learning and statistics, suggesting a possible connection to cs.LG. Finally, the paper deals with worst-case bounds, which could be relevant to cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
