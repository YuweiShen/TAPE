The paper also discusses the structural properties of these codes, which could fall under the sub-categories of Data Structures (cs.DS) and Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). The explicit construction of the codes and the lower bound on their parameters could also be of interest to researchers in the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the recursive structure of some partially symmetric monomial codes, which could be relevant to researchers in the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
