The proposed solution learns a similarity function that combines cues from both image and spatial features of objects. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): Multi-object tracking is a crucial task in robotics, especially for autonomous vehicles. The paper evaluates the proposed approach on the KITTI dataset, which is a popular benchmark for autonomous driving. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper exploits the power of deep learning to formulate the data association problem as inference in a CNN. The proposed solution learns to perform global assignments in 3D purely from data. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a data-driven approach to solve the multi-object tracking problem, which is a fundamental task in AI. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with tracking objects in video sequences, which is a multimedia-related task. The proposed solution combines cues from both image and spatial features of objects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
