This is a common problem in artificial intelligence, and falls under the category of active learning. \n2. cs.LG - The paper proposes a method for learning how to query without knowledge of the hidden hypothesis, which involves building an implication model that predicts the outcome of the potential next observation conditioned on the results of past observations. This is a machine learning problem, and falls under the category of learning to acquire information. \n3. cs.DS - The paper deals with the problem of finding the optimal subset of observations, which is intractable in general. This is a problem in computational complexity, and falls under the category of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SE - The paper proposes a method for selecting the next most-informative observation based on the results of previous observations, which is a common problem in software engineering. This falls under the category of software engineering. \n5. cs.RO - The paper proposes a method for selecting the next most-informative observation based on the results of previous observations, which is a common problem in robotics.
