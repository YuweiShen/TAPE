It may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it considers the transmission of the video over a wireless network. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses tiling and encoding of the video. Graphics (cs.GR) is also a possibility as the paper deals with the immersive viewing experience of VR. Finally, the paper proposes two low-complexity algorithms, which may place it in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
