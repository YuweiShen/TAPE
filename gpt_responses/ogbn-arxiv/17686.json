Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for multi-modal feature fusion, which is a common problem in VQA, indicating that it may also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also uses deep neural networks, suggesting that it may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
