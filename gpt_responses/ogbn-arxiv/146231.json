The paper also discusses regularization strategies for these methods, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel technique based on Sobolev gradients, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NE) and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
