Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The tool also supports collaborative annotation, which suggests a possible fit with sub-categories such as cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The annotations can be exported to plain text data formats, which could be used for further processing and analysis, indicating a possible fit with sub-categories such as cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
