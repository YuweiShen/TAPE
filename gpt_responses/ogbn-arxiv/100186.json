The paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) due to the analysis of the time complexity of the algorithms and the use of game-theoretic concepts in the problem formulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
