It may also fall under Multimedia (cs.MM) as it explores the use of DCT representation for image compression. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible category as the paper discusses methods for efficient transmission of compressed images. Machine Learning (cs.LG) is also a possibility as the paper tailors an existing network to the DCT inputs. Finally, the paper may also fall under Graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with image representation and manipulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
