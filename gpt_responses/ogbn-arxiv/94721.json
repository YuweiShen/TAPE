Therefore, the most likely category is Computer Vision (cs.CV), which deals with image and video analysis. The paper also involves the use of embedded systems for real-time performance, which falls under Robotics (cs.RO). The use of deep learning models for object detection is a popular topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the economic analysis of the proposed solution, which could be relevant to Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) in terms of cost-benefit analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
