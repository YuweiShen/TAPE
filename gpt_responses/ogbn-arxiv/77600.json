The proposed framework and models are evaluated on several datasets, including citation networks and molecular datasets, which are commonly used in machine learning research related to graph analysis (cs.SI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions using the proposed models for whole graph classification and regression, which are tasks related to computer vision and image analysis (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
