The paper focuses on the development of imitative models, which are probabilistic predictive models that can plan expert-like trajectories to achieve arbitrary goals. Given the focus on machine learning and control, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves computer vision techniques for autonomous driving, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper also involves system-level considerations for autonomous driving, which suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
