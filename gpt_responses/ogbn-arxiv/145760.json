The use of MMSE and ZF receivers also suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI). The term \"macrodiversity\" in the title indicates a possible interest in wireless communication systems (cs.MA), and the analysis of symbol error rate for M-PSK or M-QAM modulations suggests a focus on communication theory (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
