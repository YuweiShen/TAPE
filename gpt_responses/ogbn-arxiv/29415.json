This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), social and information networks (cs.SI), information retrieval (cs.IR), social computing (cs.SOC), and cybersecurity (cs.CYBER). The focus on altmetric performance also suggests a potential fit with the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HCI). However, given the specific context of the study, the first five sub-categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
