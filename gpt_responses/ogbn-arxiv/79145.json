The paper proposes algorithms for the Multi-Round Influence Maximization (MRIM) problem, which involves selecting seed nodes in multiple rounds to maximize the expected number of activated nodes. This problem is related to social influence, network analysis, and optimization, which are all areas of interest in CS. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science). Additionally, the paper involves designing algorithms and analyzing their performance, which falls under cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
