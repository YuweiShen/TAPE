This involves selecting questions that optimize the trade-off between robot and human uncertainty, and determining when these questions become redundant or costly. The paper also includes simulations and a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with learning algorithms for robots. Additionally, the paper also focuses on human-robot interaction and user studies, which could place it in the cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) category. Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of questions, which could also place it in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
