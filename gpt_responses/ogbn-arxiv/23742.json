This technique is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and robotics (cs.AR). However, given the focus on training deep neural networks, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.AR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
