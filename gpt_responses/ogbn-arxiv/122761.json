Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely categories. The paper also uses self-supervised learning, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia), and conventional multi-view stereo algorithms, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper does not require manual interaction or patient CT, indicating the use of artificial intelligence, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
