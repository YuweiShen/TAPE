The paper also discusses distributed problems, which could fall under the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories. The paper also touches upon topics such as common randomness and secret key agreement, which are relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category.
