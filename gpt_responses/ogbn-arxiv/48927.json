The paper also mentions game theory and equilibrium selection, which are subfields of computer science that fall under the category of cs.GT (game theory). The use of likelihood estimates and fictitious play learning models suggests that the paper may also fall under the subfields of cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.MA (multiagent systems). Finally, the discussion of convergence and the use of maximum likelihood suggests that the paper may also fall under the subfield of cs.SY (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
