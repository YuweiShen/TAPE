The paper also mentions the use of these algorithms in formal verification tools and decision procedures for logical theories, which suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper describes techniques based on trace inclusion and simulation relations, which are concepts that are often studied in the area of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
