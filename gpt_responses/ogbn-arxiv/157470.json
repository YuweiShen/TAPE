This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of deep learning also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed method also involves post-processing to eliminate outliers, which relates to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of false positives, which is a concern in the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
