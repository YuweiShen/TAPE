It also involves the study of codes with specific properties, such as maximally recoverable and partially maximally recoverable codes, which can be considered as topics in discrete structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of finite fields in code construction, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
