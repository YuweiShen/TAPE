The proposed method involves the use of adversarial training and sub-domain aggregation, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method is for autonomous driving, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper uses datasets commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research, such as Cityscapes and BDDS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
