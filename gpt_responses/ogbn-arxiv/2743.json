This involves the use of probability density functions (pdfs) to model the fluctuations of the irradiance of optical channels distorted by atmospheric conditions. The paper proposes novel and precise analytical expressions for the ergodic capacity of MIMO FSO systems based on reliable approximations of the pdfs. This work involves aspects of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), optics (cs.OH), physics (cs.PH), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
