The paper also discusses submodular and subadditive valuations, which are concepts from discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The use of algorithms to find equilibria suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the focus on social welfare aligns with the field of computational economics (cs.EC). Finally, the mention of communication complexity hints at information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
