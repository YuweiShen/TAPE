The use of evolutionary algorithms and benchmarking also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of a classical planner (YAHSP), which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the comparison of different variants of the algorithm on different instances suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
