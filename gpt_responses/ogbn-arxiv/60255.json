The paper also introduces a new notion of local polarization, which could be of interest to researchers in the areas of distributed systems (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the application of polar codes to compressing i.i.d. sources and channel coding, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
