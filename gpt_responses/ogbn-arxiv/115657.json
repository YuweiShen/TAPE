The paper also involves analyzing a trained network, which falls under the cs.LG sub-category. The need for explainability in safety critical systems also suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.CR sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a solution for generating explanations, which could fall under the cs.SE sub-category.
