This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper proposes a solution using maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper is primarily concerned with distributed computing, specifically the problem of speeding up large-scale tasks using redundancy. It proposes a solution to the straggler problem in this context. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with link failures in wired/wireless networks, which is a classic problem in networking. The proposed solution involves modeling the links as packet erasure channels, which is a common technique in networking research. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a solution to a control problem, namely how to speed up large-scale tasks in a distributed computing system while dealing with link failures. The proposed solution involves designing an MDS code that can tolerate packet erasures. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a solution to a classic algorithmic problem, namely how to speed up large-scale tasks in a distributed computing system using redundancy.
