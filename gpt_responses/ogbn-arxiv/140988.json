Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The algorithmic approach used in the paper involves sorting and binary search, which are common techniques in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem of enclosing a set of points in a minimum-width shell is related to the concept of bounding volumes, which is a topic in cs.GR (Graphics). The paper also presents an algorithm that can be extended to higher dimensions, which falls under the scope of cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
