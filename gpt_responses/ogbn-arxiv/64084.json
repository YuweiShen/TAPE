This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of deep supervised hashing for multimedia retrieval, which is a common application in this sub-category. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper may also be relevant to this sub-category as it discusses the use of deep supervised hashing for text retrieval, which is a common task in natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
