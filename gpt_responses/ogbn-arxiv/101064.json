Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a common technique in computer vision research. The paper also involves understanding and visualizing deep models, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of a new loss function and evaluation metrics could also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The study of how deep models extract features for fixation prediction could fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the role of high-level semantic knowledge in saliency, which could fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
