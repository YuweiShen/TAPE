The paper specifically focuses on embedding entities and relations of knowledge bases in a continuous vector space. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and databases (cs.DB). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
