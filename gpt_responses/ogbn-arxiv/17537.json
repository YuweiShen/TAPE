The paper also talks about the use of DNS for communication and tunneling, which is related to network protocols and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper proposes solutions to combat malicious DNS tunneling, which involves system and software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability and efficiency of name resolution, which is related to systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
