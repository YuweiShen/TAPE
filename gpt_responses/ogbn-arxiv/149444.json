This falls under the scope of natural language processing and language modeling, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques to learn effective representations of EHR data for downstream tasks such as mortality prediction and length of stay. This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is a subfield of CS.LG.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the challenges and importance of effective representation learning of EHR data, which has implications for healthcare and society. This falls under the scope of computers and society, which is a subfield of CS.CY.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper applies computational techniques to healthcare data, which can be seen as a form of computational science. This falls under the scope of CS.CE.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses AI techniques such as transformer networks and BERT language model to learn effective representations of EHR data. This falls under the scope of CS.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
