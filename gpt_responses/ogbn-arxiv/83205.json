The use of structured convolutions and the sampling of both $f$ and $f^{\\prime}$ on the real line suggest a numerical analysis (cs.NA) perspective. The experimental results with the Gerchberg-Saxton method suggest a machine learning (cs.LG) perspective. Finally, the comparison between conjugate phase retrieval and phase retrieval suggests a signal processing (cs.SP) or information theory (cs.IT) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
