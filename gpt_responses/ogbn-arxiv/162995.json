The problem involves optimization of certain measures such as sum-channel capacity, Bit Error Rate (BER), and distance criteria. These measures are typical in the field of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networked Systems (cs.NI). The use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) also suggests a connection to the field of Swarm Intelligence (cs.SI). The paper also deals with the practical implementation of suboptimal large signature matrices, which could be relevant to the field of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of optimization algorithms and statistical measures suggests a connection to the field of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
