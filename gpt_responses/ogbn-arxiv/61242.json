The use of feedback and channel state information (CSI) is also a common theme in this field. The paper specifically focuses on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which are often studied in the context of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses coding schemes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with the concept of degrees of freedom (DoF), which is a topic in both network information theory and multi-agent systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of feedback and CSI on the DoF region, which is a topic in communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
