Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves multimodal learning, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia).
