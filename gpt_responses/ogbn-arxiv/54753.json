This is a common topic in machine learning and falls under the sub-category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of embeddings for visualizing and clustering data, which could fall under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Computer Vision\" (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of embeddings for datasets with high cardinality features, which could fall under \"Databases\" (cs.DB).
