This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically involves social influence modeling (cs.SI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and social network analysis (cs.SOC). Additionally, the proposed model utilizes neural networks for learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
