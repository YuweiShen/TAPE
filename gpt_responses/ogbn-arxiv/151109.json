Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also mentions information retrieval and question answering systems, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The creation of a lexicon and the use of patterns indicate that it could also fit into cs.LG (Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
