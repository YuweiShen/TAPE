This involves the use of cognitive radio techniques for spectrum sensing and access. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This category covers research on computer networks, protocols, architectures, and applications. The paper's focus on D2D communications and HetNets makes it relevant to this category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This category covers research on the mathematical foundations of information and communication. The paper's analysis of the queueing process and probability mass function of delay and queue length makes it relevant to this category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This category covers research on the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, as well as security and privacy issues in computer systems. The paper's use of cognitive radio techniques for spectrum sensing and access makes it relevant to this category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category covers research on social networks, online communities, and other types of information networks. The paper's focus on caching popular contents for frequent access makes it relevant to this category.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia):"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
