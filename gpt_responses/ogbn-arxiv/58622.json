The title and abstract suggest that the paper focuses on multiscale geometric representations, which are commonly used in computer vision and image processing. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions frequency selectivity, which is related to signal processing and information theory, suggesting cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of dictionaries and algorithms suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
