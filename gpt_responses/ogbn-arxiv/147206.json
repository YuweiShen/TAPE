This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method also involves sparse learning, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the proposed algorithm, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
