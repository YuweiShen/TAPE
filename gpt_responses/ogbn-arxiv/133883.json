It could also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category as it deals with a specific logic system, prioritised default logic. The paper's focus on structured argumentation and distributed reasoning suggests it could also belong to the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category. The use of game proof theories could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category, while the use of a framework for structured argumentation could place it in the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
