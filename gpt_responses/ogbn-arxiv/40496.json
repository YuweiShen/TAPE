The paper discusses the use of this algorithm in the context of hyper-parameter optimization of a popular gradient boosting tree algorithm, which suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
