This involves simulating several antenna configurations and collecting network-level statistics, which are then used to train an emulator that can quickly estimate the global optimum configuration. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper heavily relies on machine learning techniques to optimize complex systems, specifically using well-known learning algorithms to emulate a complex simulator with a modest dataset obtained from it. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on antenna design for next-generation mmWave cellular systems, which involves simulating network-level statistics. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve information theory concepts related to the optimization of complex systems. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper may involve systems and control concepts related to the optimization of complex systems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper heavily relies on artificial intelligence techniques, specifically machine learning, to optimize complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
