The authors also consider imperfect channel state information (CSI), which is a common issue in wireless communication systems and falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses outage probability, ergodic rate, and symbol error rate (SER), which are performance metrics related to communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper also mentions the number of antennas and the number of data streams, which are related to multiple antenna systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
