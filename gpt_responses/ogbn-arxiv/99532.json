This involves designing a fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. These concepts are related to information theory and signal processing, which are covered in the cs.IT sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the limitations of spatial multiplexing (SM) gains in ultra-dense small cell networks and proposes a technique to overcome these limitations. This involves designing a virtual MIMO channel that leads to improved diversity and SINR at the receiver. These concepts are related to networking and internet architecture, which are covered in the cs.NI sub-category.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a technique to enhance throughput in ultra-dense small cell networks by shaping transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct interpolating filters. This involves designing a fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion.
