Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves information theory and communication systems, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as the second likely sub-category. The study of system performance and design tradeoffs falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control), making it the third likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of interference on radar detection, which relates to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as a fourth likely sub-category. Finally, the use of mm-wave radars in the study suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as a fifth likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
