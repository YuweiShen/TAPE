The paper also discusses a formal semantics for the language, which is related to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper's focus on encoding and supporting numerous existing criteria suggests a systems (cs.SY) perspective. Finally, the paper's mention of experiments suggests a potential application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in evaluating the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
