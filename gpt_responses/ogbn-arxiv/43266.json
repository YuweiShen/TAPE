The models are based on dynamical systems and extend Kalman filters, hidden Markov models, and nonlinear dynamical systems. The paper provides tractable inference and learning algorithms for arbitrary DST topologies via an efficient structured mean-field algorithm. The diverse applicability of DSTs is demonstrated by experiments on gene expression data and by modeling group behavior in the setting of an American football game. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
