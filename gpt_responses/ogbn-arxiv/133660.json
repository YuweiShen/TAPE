The paper presents an algorithmic proof of the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma, which is a stronger version of the Lovasz Local Lemma that applies to a wider range of problems. The paper also develops efficient resampling oracles for various applications of the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma. These aspects suggest that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithmic proof of the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma and develops efficient resampling oracles, which are algorithmic tools. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the cs.DS sub-category.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper deals with the computational efficiency of the algorithmic proof of the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma and the resampling oracles. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the cs.CC sub-category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses information-theoretic concepts such as entropy and mutual information to analyze the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma and its applications. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the cs.IT sub-category.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
