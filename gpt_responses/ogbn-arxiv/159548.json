The use of normalization techniques is also mentioned, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of a secondary objective loss, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning (cs.LG) and other areas of machine learning. The experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification, which is a common task in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the proposed method across different batch sizes, which is a common concern in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
