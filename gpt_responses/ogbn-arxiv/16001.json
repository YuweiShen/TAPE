Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also applies the constructed data structure to solve several problems related to approximation algorithms, compression, and analysis of functions, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
