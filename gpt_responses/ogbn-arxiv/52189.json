It also mentions convolutional networks, which are commonly used in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also discusses architectural efforts in designing deeper or wider networks, which suggests it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of skip connections and fusion operations could also place this paper in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category, as these are common techniques in deep learning. \n\nThe mention of feature hierarchy and merging structures could suggest a connection to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category, which deals with neural networks and their optimization. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on recognition and resolution in visual tasks could also place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category, as natural language processing often involves similar tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
