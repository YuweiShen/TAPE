The paper proposes a new method for data programming that enhances the existing paradigm by supporting continuous labeling functions and quality guides. This involves the use of generative models, which falls under the category of \"Artificial Intelligence\". The paper also applies the proposed method to five different applications, including natural language processing and computer vision, which fall under the categories of \"Computation and Language\" and \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\", respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the stability and reliability of the proposed method, which falls under the category of \"Software Engineering\". Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, and cs.SE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
