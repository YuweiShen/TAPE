The use of limited annotated images and the proposed technique for sampling sequential images are also relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the proposed method to kidney segmentation in abdominal CT scans suggests a potential fit with the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for classification and segmentation may also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
