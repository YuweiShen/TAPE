The focus is on the coordination between the plant control and network management to maintain desired control performance while saving wireless resources. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) as a communication infrastructure for industrial process automation. The proposed framework includes reconfiguring the WSAN to maintain desired control performance while saving wireless resources. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but it does address the issue of enhancing the resilience of the system against wireless interferences and physical disturbances. This could potentially involve security measures to protect the system from attacks or unauthorized access.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper does not deal with robotics, but the proposed framework could potentially be applied to robotic systems that use wireless control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper does not explicitly deal with artificial intelligence, but the proposed framework includes a holistic manager that dynamically reconfigures the number of transmissions in the WSAN based on online observations of physical and cyber variables. This could potentially involve machine learning or other AI techniques to optimize the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
