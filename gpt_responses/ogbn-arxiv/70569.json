This falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies a cognitive radio downlink network with multiple primary and secondary users, and energy harvesting receivers. This involves networking and internet architecture aspects.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on secure communication and energy harvesting, and proposes a robust secure artificial noise-aided beamforming and power splitting design. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates optimization problems for transmit power minimization and max-min fairness energy harvesting, which involve system and control aspects.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although this is less likely, the paper does involve simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, which can be considered as a form of multimedia communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
