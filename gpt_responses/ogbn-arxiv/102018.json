The study also complements recent results on how limited or noisy feedback can boost communication reliability, which could fall under networked systems (cs.NI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper proposes a strategy with fixed input distribution to achieve rates close to the mutual information induced by the input distribution and the state-averaged channel, which could be considered a form of coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's results have implications for achieving the empirical capacity, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) who work on capacity estimation and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
