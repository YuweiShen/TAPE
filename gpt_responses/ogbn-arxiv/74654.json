The use of Map-Reduce computing framework and the scale of the datasets suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The scheduling problem itself involves optimization and combinatorial aspects, which are relevant to the sub-category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The development of approximation algorithms and LP relaxations suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
