This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multiagent systems (cs.MA). The paper also considers cooperative coordination mechanisms, which is related to game theory (cs.GT). The use of MDPs and expected utility also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of the proposed approach to healthcare settings suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
