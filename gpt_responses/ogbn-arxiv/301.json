The use of sparse vectors and the optimization of the detection criteria suggest that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the application of the proposed detector to spectrum sensing involves numerical analysis and optimization, which could place the paper in the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
