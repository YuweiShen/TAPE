This falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for steganography and evaluates the performance on image datasets. This falls under the scope of computer vision and pattern recognition.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with multimedia data (images) and proposes a method for hiding secret images within cover images. This falls under the scope of multimedia.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) for steganography, which is a machine learning technique. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the concept of minimizing the divergence between probability distributions, which is a concept from information theory.
