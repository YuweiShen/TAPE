The paper also applies the proposed approach to real-world tensor classification problems, particularly in the field of neuroimages. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with brain fMRI classification, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
