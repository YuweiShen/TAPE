The paper also discusses the use of a sinusoidal pulse pattern and frequency response analysis (FFT), which are techniques commonly used in signal processing and information theory (cs.CR, cs.IT). The paper also proposes a protocol called Nimbus, which involves switching between different congestion control modes, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
