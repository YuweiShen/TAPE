The paper presents results on the limitations of the greedy algorithm for influence maximization in undirected networks under the linear threshold model, which is a problem that is relevant to the sub-fields of social networks, data structures, and game theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
