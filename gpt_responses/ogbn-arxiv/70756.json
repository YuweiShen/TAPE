This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the use of light-field video in virtual and augmented reality applications to increase realism and immersion. This is related to computer graphics. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the storage, compression, and editing of light-field video, which are important aspects of multimedia. \n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper proposes a method to obtain EPIs from a sparse light-field camera array, which involves geometric computations. \n5. cs.CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper presents a new method for light-field scene flow estimation, which is a subfield of computer vision and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
