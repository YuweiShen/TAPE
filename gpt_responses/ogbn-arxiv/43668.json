The paper also discusses the efficient learning procedure for this embedding. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses pairwise relative entropy as a measure of similarity between nodes in directed graphs. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for node embedding in directed graphs, which is based on a global minimization of pairwise relative entropy and graph geodesics in a non-linear way."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
