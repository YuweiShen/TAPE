The use of multi-task and curriculum learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of datasets such as SoBiR, VIPeR, and PETA suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and possibly computer security (cs.CR) if the datasets involve surveillance footage."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
