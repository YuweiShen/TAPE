The application of the proposed algorithms is in deblurring astronomical images, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of parallel computation and matrix operations, which are relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and parallel computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses memory optimization, which is a common concern in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
