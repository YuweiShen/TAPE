The paper introduces a new neural network architecture for real-time object detection, which involves combining local and global information using an RNN architecture. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of anchor boxes and the comparison with other object detection methods also suggests that the paper could be categorized under neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
