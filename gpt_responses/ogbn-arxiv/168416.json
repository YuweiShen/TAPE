The paper focuses on reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy, which is a common goal in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions recent innovations such as C.ReLU and Inception structure, which are related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on object detection benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
