This falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA) and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). The paper also discusses the use of finite element methods to model complex geometries and conductive features, which falls under the category of modeling and simulation (cs.MS). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in the fields of electrical engineering (cs.ET) and biomedical engineering (cs.BI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
