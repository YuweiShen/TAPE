It also involves deep learning techniques, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, it involves video analysis, which makes it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of graph convolutional networks suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
