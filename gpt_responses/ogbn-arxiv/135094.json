The use of biologically inspired agents also suggests a connection to the field of multi-agent systems (MA) and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a distributed interference-aware data forwarding algorithm, which involves information theory (IT) concepts. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI, followed by cs.DS, cs.MA, cs.AI, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
