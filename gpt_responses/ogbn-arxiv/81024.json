The framework is applied to two specific domains: the taxi domain and an autonomous guided vehicle task, which are both related to robotics and control (cs.RO, cs.SY). The paper also introduces a novel algorithm for solving linearly-solvable MDPs, which is a type of optimization problem (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
