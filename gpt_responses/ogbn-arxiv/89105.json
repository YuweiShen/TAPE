This falls under the category of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses algorithms and heuristics for solving these problems, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of exponential neighbourhoods is a technique often used in Combinatorial Optimization (cs.CC) and Robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper also discusses the complexity of the problems and their special cases, which is a common topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
