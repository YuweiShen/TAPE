The paper proposes a new method for generating synthetic samples and employs a Gaussian Mixture Model to filter out synthetic majority class instances. These techniques are commonly used in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes an adaptive optimization method, which is also relevant to the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
