The use of random superposition codebooks and Forney's optimal decoder suggests a focus on communication theory (cs.COMM). The proposed convex optimization-based procedures indicate a possible connection to optimization and control theory (cs.SI). The numerical examples presented in the paper may involve simulations and data analysis, which could fall under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
