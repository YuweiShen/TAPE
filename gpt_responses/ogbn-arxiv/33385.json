The paper specifically focuses on the mathematical analysis of the phenomenon and proposes a new perspective, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in these sub-categories. Therefore, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
