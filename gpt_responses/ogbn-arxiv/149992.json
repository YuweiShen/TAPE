The paper also discusses the properties of the attributes learned from the databases, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper involves the use of convolutional networks, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE).
