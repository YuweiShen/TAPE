The use of software-defined networking (SDN) is a key aspect of the proposed solution, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of identification schemes based on network traffic information, which could be related to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the shifting responsibility for securing network services from service operators to network operators, which could be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
