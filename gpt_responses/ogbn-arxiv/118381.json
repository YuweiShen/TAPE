Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the regularization effects of the proposed framework, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the design of weight distortion functions, which may be related to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of hyper-parameter search efforts, which may be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
