However, the use of hook-length type formulas and the investigation of D-finiteness and limit laws suggest that it is more likely to belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CO (Combinatorics). The study of rectangular Young tableaux also suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the investigation of deeper structures and the use of a new efficient generic method suggest cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
