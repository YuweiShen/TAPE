This involves using neural networks to estimate the intractable expectation over hidden variables. The paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
