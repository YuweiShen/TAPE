This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a visualization technique to understand the intermediate state and network activations inside end-to-end models, which could also fall under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the memory behavior of the recurrent kernel, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper's focus on understanding the history encoded in the layers of grapheme-based end-to-end ASR networks could also suggest the sub-category of Sound (cs.SD). Finally, the paper's use of multiple decoders to predict prior input history could be relevant to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
