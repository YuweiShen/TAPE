It also considers how users interact with the navigation structure, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (HC). The proposed probabilistic model and algorithm involve artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with real-world data lakes, which may involve deep learning (DL) techniques for data analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
