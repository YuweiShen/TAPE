This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the computer vision sub-category.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the privacy concerns related to sharing query images with online visual search engines and proposes an adversarial attack to conceal the query image. This makes it relevant to the cryptography and security sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an adversarial attack on deep learning based retrieval systems, which falls under the machine learning sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of deep learning for visual search engines and proposes an adversarial attack on such systems, which is relevant to the artificial intelligence sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with visual search engines and retrieval of multimedia content, which makes it relevant to the multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
