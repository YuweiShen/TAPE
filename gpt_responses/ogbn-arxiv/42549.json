The use of non-constructive methods and the size of the counterexample may suggest a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of teq retentive sets may indicate a possible connection to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
