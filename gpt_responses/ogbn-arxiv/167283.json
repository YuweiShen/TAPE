It also mentions MOS technologies, which are related to electronic devices and circuits (cs.ET). The equations used to explain the trends in CPU evolution involve information theory (cs.IT) and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of these trends on power consumption (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
