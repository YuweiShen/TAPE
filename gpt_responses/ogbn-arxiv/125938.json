The experiments are conducted on a bimanual mobile manipulator, which falls under the domain of robotics.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a structure learning technique applied to a multimodal affordance representation that yields a population of forward models for use in planning. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The approach presented in the paper involves learning models of objects that predict how state distributions change in response to interactions with such objects. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper mentions the use of multimodal affordance representation, which could potentially involve visual information. This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to define future tasks based on the models of objects. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
