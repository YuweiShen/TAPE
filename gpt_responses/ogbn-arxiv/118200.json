The applications of linear codes with a few weights in authentication codes, secret sharing, and consumer electronics suggest that this paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer communications (cs.CC). Additionally, the use of Legendre symbol in deriving the Hamming weight distributions may indicate a connection to signal processing and information retrieval (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
