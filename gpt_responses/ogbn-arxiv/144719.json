The use of an Information Retrieval (IR) system to measure the similarity of translated sentences also suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the use of machine translation systems and the focus on improving the quality of translation could place the paper in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of sorting and ranking techniques to order the extracted sentences by their degree of similarity could also suggest that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the focus on language processing and the use of comparable corpora could place the paper in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
