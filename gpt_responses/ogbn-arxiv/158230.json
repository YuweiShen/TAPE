The use of self-triggered coordination methods is also a common approach in MAS. Therefore, cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) and cs.RO (Robotics) are the most likely categories. The paper also deals with control and optimization of the deployment process, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of decentralized methods and the relaxation of communication requirements suggest the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the use of performance metrics and the optimization of coverage suggest the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
