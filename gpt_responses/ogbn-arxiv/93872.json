The paper proposes a novel method that addresses two challenging issues in pedestrian detection, namely small-scaled pedestrians and occluded pedestrians. This involves the use of a gated multi-layer feature extraction sub-network and a deformable occlusion handling sub-network, which are both based on deep learning techniques. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
