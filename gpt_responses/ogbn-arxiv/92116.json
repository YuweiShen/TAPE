This involves semantically annotating and unifying heterogeneous data, enriching semantic WoT datasets with external knowledge graphs, and providing analysis of data through reasoning mechanisms. These topics are closely related to information retrieval (cs.IR), databases (cs.DB), social and information networks (cs.SI), software engineering (cs.SE), and machine learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
