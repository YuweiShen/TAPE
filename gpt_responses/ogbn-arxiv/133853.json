This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper studies the problem of cops chasing a drunk robber on a graph, which involves decision-making and strategy. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The cops and robbers game is a classic example of game theory, and the paper studies a variant of this game. This falls under the scope of computer science and game theory.\n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper mentions the invisible robber game, which involves hiding and seeking on a graph. This falls under the scope of computational geometry.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The cops and robbers game can be seen as a model for network security, and the paper discusses the problem of capturing a drunk robber on a graph.
