The paper specifically focuses on post-hoc explanatory methods for neural networks, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the validation of these methods, which falls under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper uses a real-world neural network architecture, which suggests the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV) may be relevant. Finally, the paper discusses the need for publicly available evaluation frameworks, which falls under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
