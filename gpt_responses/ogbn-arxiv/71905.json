The paper also involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.DM), as well as computational geometry (cs.CG) for some of the geometric aspects of the problem. Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed labeling schemes in network infrastructure (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
