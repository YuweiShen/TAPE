The paper focuses on the manipulation problem and uses trajectory optimization to find a feasible trajectory. The paper also validates the algorithm on hardware, which suggests that it is a robotics-related paper. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a feedback controller for stabilizing the nonlinear system during online execution. The paper characterizes the local multi-contact dynamics around the trajectory as a piecewise affine system, which suggests that it is a systems and control-related paper. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses trajectory optimization to find a feasible trajectory, which suggests that it may be a machine learning-related paper. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a model-based approach for designing feedback policies, which suggests that it may be an artificial intelligence-related paper. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision or pattern recognition, it is possible that these techniques were used in the hardware validation of the algorithm. Therefore, cs.CV is a less likely but still possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
