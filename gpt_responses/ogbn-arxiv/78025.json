The paper proposes a Semi-Parametric approach to dynamics learning, which combines physics-based Parametric models with unstructured Non-Parametric regression. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, given the focus on robotics and control, we believe that cs.RO is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LG and cs.SY. The paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision, so cs.CV is the least likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
