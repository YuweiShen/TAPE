This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the feasibility and cost of using virtualisation techniques over resource-constrained aerial vehicle platforms, which could fall under the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of RPAs in emergency cases, which could be related to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper may also be relevant to the Architecture (cs.AR) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-categories, as it discusses the integration of RPAs into the 5G infrastructure and the potential security implications of using these platforms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
