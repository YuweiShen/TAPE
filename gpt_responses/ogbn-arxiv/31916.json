The codes are designed to be secure against spoofing attacks, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of splitting in the construction of the codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of security and privacy in machine learning (cs.SI), as spoofing attacks are a common threat in this area. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), as the construction of optimal authentication codes involves the use of mathematical algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
