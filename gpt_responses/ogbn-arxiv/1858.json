This falls under the domain of robotics and control systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper explores different approaches to ensuring system safety from an avionics point of view and proposes a new safety system for UAVs. This is closely related to systems and control.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the risks associated with software failures in UAVs and presents experimental results on the dangers of uncontrolled crashes. This falls under the domain of software engineering.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper mentions the need for safe and ubiquitous human-system interaction in UAVs and discusses how the prescribed safety requirements in general aviation are not adapted for UAVs. This is related to human-computer interaction.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the authors briefly mention the importance of security in UAVs and how geofencing can be used to limit collateral damages. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
