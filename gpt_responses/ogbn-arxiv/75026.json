This involves learning a function that takes a query as input and outputs the result of the query, which can be used as a real-time, low-memory approximator for aggregation queries. This work involves techniques from database systems (cs.DB) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG), as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) for the visualization and interaction aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
