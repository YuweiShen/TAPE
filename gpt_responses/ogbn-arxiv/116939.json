This falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the use of CMOS ROM-embedded RAM (ROAM) and lookup tables suggests a focus on hardware implementation and design (cs.AR). The paper also discusses energy efficiency, which could fall under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET) or energy optimization (cs.EM). Finally, the use of in-memory computation could also be relevant to the category of computer systems and hardware (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
