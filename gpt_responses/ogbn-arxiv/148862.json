The authors propose a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for this task, which involves training a generative model (cs.LG) over publicly available datasets such as CIFAR-10 and Places365. The approach is designed to fully generalize the colorization procedure (cs.AI) and the results are compared with traditional deep neural networks (cs.GR, cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
