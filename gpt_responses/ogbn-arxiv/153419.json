The paper also discusses numerical experiments on LeNet-5 and wide-residual-networks for MNIST and CIFAR 10/100, which are common datasets used in machine learning research. Additionally, the paper involves optimization algorithms and variable splitting techniques, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
