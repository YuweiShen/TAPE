The use of Fourier analysis and the $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the algorithmic applications of the results suggest that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
