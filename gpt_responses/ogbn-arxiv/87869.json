The team submitted runs using two methods: BOIR, which uses Bayesian optimization to optimize retrieval model hyperparameters, and NVSM, which is a latent vector space model learned in an unsupervised manner. These methods are commonly used in the fields of information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), and deep learning (cs.DL). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
