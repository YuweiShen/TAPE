The proposed architecture involves offline learning and online training, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of discriminative power in the presence of distractors, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
