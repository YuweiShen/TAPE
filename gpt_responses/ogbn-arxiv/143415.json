The proposed model integrates both latent and explicit features, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of a pre-trained embedding model and knowledge base extraction suggests the use of database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
