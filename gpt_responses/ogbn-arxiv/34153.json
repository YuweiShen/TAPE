This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses unsupervised, weakly-supervised and self-supervised feature learning techniques, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of neural networks for feature learning is also related to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
