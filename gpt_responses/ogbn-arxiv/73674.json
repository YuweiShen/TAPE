The numerical experiments performed on both linear and nonlinear stationary systems illustrate the ability of the technique to improve (expected) ROM prediction accuracy by an order of magnitude. \n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is unlikely as the paper does not deal with social or information networks. \n\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a technique that extends the reduced-order-model error surrogates (ROMES) method to closure modeling using Gaussian-process regression to construct a statistical model. This technique can be considered a machine learning approach. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with constructing a statistical closure model for reduced-order models of stationary systems. This falls under the category of systems and control. \n\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a technique for constructing a statistical closure model for reduced-order models applied to stationary systems modeled as parameterized systems of algebraic equations. This technique can be applied in various fields such as engineering, finance, and science, making it relevant to this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
