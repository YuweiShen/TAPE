This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the impact of channel state information (CSI) on the performance, which is related to the signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper derives the degrees of freedom (DoF) region, which is a measure of the capacity of the channel, and this falls under the computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
