The proposed architecture involves the use of object learners, which are commonly used in object recognition (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). The architecture also involves vocabulary expansion, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the generation of novel objects, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
