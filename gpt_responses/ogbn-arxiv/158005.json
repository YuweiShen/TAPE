The paper also mentions the use of channel state information (CSI) which is a key aspect of wireless networking. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category as it proposes a novel interference management scheme that involves modifying the spatial feature of the interference signal. This involves processing the data contained in the interfering signal, which is related to information theory. \n\nThe cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper mentions enhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) which is related to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n\nThe cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category is another possibility as the paper proposes a scheme that intelligently determines the strength of the steering signal to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. This involves control of the system parameters to optimize performance. \n\nFinally, the cs.COM (Computers and Society) sub-category is a less likely possibility as the paper does not explicitly address social or ethical issues related to the use of wireless communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
