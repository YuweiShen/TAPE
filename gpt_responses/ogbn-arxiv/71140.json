Big Data technologies are used to integrate common and disparate data sets to deliver the right information at the appropriate time to the correct decision-maker. This involves database management and data integration, which falls under the scope of cs.DB.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses how Big Data technologies can be used to optimize operations in the upstream segment of the petroleum industry. This involves computational modeling and simulation, which falls under the scope of cs.CE.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses how Big Data technologies can transform decision-making from reactive to proactive and optimize all phases of exploration, development, and production. This involves the use of machine learning and other AI techniques to analyze large volumes of data and make predictions, which falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly mentions that Big Data technologies can help ensure safer, more responsible operations. This involves data security and privacy, which falls under the scope of cs.CR.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses how Big Data technologies can be used to optimize operations in the upstream segment of the petroleum industry. This involves software development and integration, which falls under the scope of cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
