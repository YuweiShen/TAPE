The proposed Adversarial Composition Modular Network (ACMN) uses dependency parse tree for each question to enable global context reasoning. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper also involves machine learning techniques such as adversarial attention and residual composition, indicating that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
