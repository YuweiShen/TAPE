The paper proposes a novel variant of denoising k-sparse autoencoders to generate interpretable distributed word representations. This work also involves large scale human evaluation, which is a common practice in the field of computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) because it proposes a new method for learning representations using autoencoders. The paper discusses the success of neural models in learning rich and expressive representations, which is a common theme in machine learning research. \n\nAdditionally, the paper could belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because it deals with the development of intelligent systems that can understand natural language. The paper proposes a method for generating interpretable word embeddings, which is an important aspect of building intelligent systems that can explain their reasoning. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) because it involves the use of neural networks to learn representations.
