This technique exploits the constellation diversity of wireless networks and is independent of the channel variations. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory) which deals with the fundamental limits of reliable information transmission and storage. Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) which deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer networks, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) which deals with the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, cs.MM (Multimedia) which deals with the processing, transmission, and storage of multimedia data, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) which deals with the modeling, analysis, and control of complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
