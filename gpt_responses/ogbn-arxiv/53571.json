It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep neural networks are a popular tool in AI research. Additionally, since the paper focuses on image classification, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions the use of deep NNs in automated control, which suggests it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, since the paper deals with verification and security of deep NNs, it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
