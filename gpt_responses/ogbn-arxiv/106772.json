The method involves using evolutionary strategies and first-order optimization, which are techniques commonly used in optimization and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also mentions reinforcement learning and synthetic gradients, which are sub-fields of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper applies the method to example problems in computer vision (cs.CV), demonstrating its effectiveness in a specific application domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
