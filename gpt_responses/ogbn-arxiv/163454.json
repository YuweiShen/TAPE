The paper also proposes a neural network architecture, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of force/torque information and operational space force controller also suggests the involvement of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on a gear assembly task, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) for object recognition and tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
