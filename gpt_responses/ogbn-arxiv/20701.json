The use of belief propagation methods to solve these problems is a common technique in Statistical Mechanics (cs.SI) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the optimization of transmit powers, transmit beamforming vectors, and sub-band allocation, which are topics studied in the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
