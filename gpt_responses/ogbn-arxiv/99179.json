The proposed framework consists of a multi-relational attentive module and a heterogeneous graph attention network to learn complex/semantic relationships between user-URL pairs, user-user pairs, and URL-URL pairs. Therefore, this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This category deals with natural language processing, computational linguistics, and speech processing. The proposed framework involves processing textual data to learn complex relationships between user-URL pairs, user-user pairs, and URL-URL pairs, which falls under the scope of this category.\n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category deals with the study of social networks, online communities, and information networks. The proposed framework aims to mitigate the impact of fake news in social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, which falls under the scope of this category.\n\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This category deals with the study of information retrieval techniques, including search engines, recommender systems, and question-answering systems. The proposed framework involves building a fact-checking URL recommender system, which falls under the scope of this category.\n\n4. cs.SOC (Computers and Society): This"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
