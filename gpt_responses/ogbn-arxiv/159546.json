This is a core topic in computer vision research.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper also discusses the use of semantic representations learned from unsupervised text corpora, which falls under the domain of natural language processing and computation.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a mechanism that adaptively combines information from different modalities, which is a machine learning problem.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Few-shot learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and the paper proposes a novel approach to improve its performance.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with both visual and textual modalities, which is relevant to multimedia research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
