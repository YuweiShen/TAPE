The paper proposes a new algorithm that combines ideas from AltMin approach for non-convex sparse phase retrieval and projected gradient descent approach for solving linear inverse problems using generative priors. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
