Additionally, the use of metrics and measures commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG) suggest these sub-categories as well. Information retrieval (cs.IR) could also be a possibility due to the data collection procedure. Finally, the need to correct wrongly labeled images and identities suggests a potential overlap with computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
