The paper proposes different architectures for learning to de-light and relight an image, and evaluates the approach on a dataset of portraits captured in a controlled light stage setup. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by graphics (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves some physics-based image formation models, which could potentially fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
