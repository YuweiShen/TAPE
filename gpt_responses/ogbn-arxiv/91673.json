The security aspect of the problem suggests that it may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of block-encoding and numerical examples suggests that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
