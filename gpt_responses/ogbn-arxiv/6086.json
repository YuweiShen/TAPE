Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel fusion approach using recurrent neural networks, which falls under cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed approach on three public datasets, which is a common practice in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
