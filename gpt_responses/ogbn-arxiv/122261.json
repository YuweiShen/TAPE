Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves natural language processing techniques to analyze the text of the papers, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible sub-category. The use of machine learning classifiers and tools for improving the gestalt of papers also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as possible sub-categories.
