The paper also proposes a representation algorithm based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) and singular value decomposition (SVD), which involves machine learning (cs.AI) and linear algebra (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on tracking set target points, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
