This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper leverages recent advances in multi-robot motion planning for high DoF systems, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with optimization and computational challenges, which suggests that it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel multi-modal extension of the dRRT* algorithm, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the approach and compares it to alternatives, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
