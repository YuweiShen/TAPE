The paper focuses on policy gradient type of planning algorithms and derives new loss functions for model learning that incorporate how the planner uses the model. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it deals with learning models. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with reinforcement learning, cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as they deal with control and planning, and cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) as it deals with decision-making in a multi-agent environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
