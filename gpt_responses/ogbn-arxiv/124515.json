The tool uses an efficient language agnostic measure based on the edit history that focuses on wiki links to easily identify which topics within a Wikipedia article have been most controversial and when. This work involves natural language processing, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the tool's application to analyzing societal controversies in Wikipedia articles suggests a connection to the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
