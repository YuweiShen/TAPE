The application of spanners in network backbones suggests a possible fit in the sub-category of network science (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the emergence of good spanners in reality, which could be interpreted as a study of complex systems (cs.SI) or data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
