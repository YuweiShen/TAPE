Therefore, cs.IR and cs.LG are the most likely categories. Additionally, the paper mentions natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as keyphrases, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of document embeddings also suggests a possible connection to deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the evaluation of the algorithms in an online setting may relate to cybersecurity (cs.CY) concerns."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
