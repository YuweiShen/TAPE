The paper discusses theoretical properties of the solutions, such as nonsmoothness, trajectory existence, task convergence, and stability. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
