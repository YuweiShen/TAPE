Therefore, cs.CV and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of multispectral pedestrian detection in autonomous driving, which falls under the robotics (RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses semantic segmentation, which is a sub-field of multimedia (MM), making it a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
