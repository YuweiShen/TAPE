The most likely category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which is specifically dedicated to research on social networks and their analysis. The second likely category is cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), which deals with the application of computational methods to social science research. The paper also proposes a multiple-trial approach that involves using machine learning algorithms to estimate influence probabilities, which makes it relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of Explore-Exploit strategies to select seed nodes is also relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes an incremental algorithm to reduce the overhead of handling user feedback information, which is relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
