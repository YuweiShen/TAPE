The paper also presents a fixed-parameter tractable approximation scheme, which is a common topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of greedy algorithms and local search, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
