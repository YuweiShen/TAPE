This involves image and sinogram domain deep learning architecture, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning also suggests that the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of real data, which suggests that it may fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of a novel algorithm for reconstruction suggests that it may fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
