The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN), for image analysis (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the internal mechanisms of a CNN and links it with previously stated ideas, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with cover-source mismatch, which is a problem in multimedia forensics (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses a joint minimization approach for feature extraction and learning, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
