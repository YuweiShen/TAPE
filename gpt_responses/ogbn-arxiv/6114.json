This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Dendritic Cell Algorithm is an AI algorithm inspired by the function of natural dendritic cells. The paper proposes a deterministic version of this algorithm and experiments with its parameters, which falls under the domain of AI.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper uses a port scan dataset to test the performance of the algorithm, which is a common dataset used in the domain of cybersecurity. The Dendritic Cell Algorithm has also been used in intrusion detection systems, which falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The Dendritic Cell Algorithm is a bio-inspired algorithm that mimics the behavior of natural dendritic cells in the immune system. This falls under the domain of neural and evolutionary computing.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper introduces a novel metric for the assessment of the algorithm's output, which could be useful in the domain of social and information networks for analyzing large datasets.
