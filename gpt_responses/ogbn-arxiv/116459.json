The paper briefly surveys some of its popular use cases. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the basic structures used to design deep neural networks, which is a subfield of neural computing. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): DL has also been applied to natural language processing tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. Although the paper does not explicitly mention this, it is possible that it briefly touches on some of these applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
