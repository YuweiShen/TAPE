It may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it presents a formalism for quantifying the changing part of the wireless signal modulated by human motion. Additionally, it could be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a new subspace tracking technique to describe the channel statistics in an interpretable way. It may also fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it characterizes the signal and noise subspaces for the case of uncontrolled human movement. Finally, it could be classified under cs.MM (Multimedia) as it discusses the potential for applying CSI for a variety of human sensing applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
