The paper also presents an algorithm for searching for the most informative score subject to both calibration and minimal error rate disparity, which is a common problem in machine learning.\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the issue of fairness in algorithmic decision-making, which is a topic of interest in the field of computers and society. The paper also applies the proposed algorithm to credit lending, which is a domain where fairness is an important societal concern.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper may be relevant to the field of cryptography and security, as fairness is an important consideration in the design of secure and trustworthy systems. The paper also discusses the problem of mitigating bias in decision-making, which is a security concern in many applications.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the problem of reconciling two fundamental conditions for algorithmic fairness, which is a topic of interest in the field of artificial intelligence.
