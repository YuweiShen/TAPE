Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a learning framework that connects text terms to relevant parts and suppresses connections to non-visual text terms, which involves machine learning (ML) techniques such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with zero-shot recognition, which involves information retrieval (IR) techniques. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
