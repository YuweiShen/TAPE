The paper also discusses the effects of architectural alignment on the synthesis process, which is relevant to the fields of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance and storage size of the synthesized networks, which is relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the exploration of the search space of possible network architectures, which is relevant to the field of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
