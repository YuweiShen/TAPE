Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a geometrical method to obtain guard distances, which involves mathematical modeling and analysis, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the impact of different parameters on the optimal maximum throughput, which falls under the category of system analysis and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions simulations, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), depending on the nature of the simulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
