The use of neuromorphic hardware for low-power operation is also a key aspect of the paper, which could be classified under the sub-category of electronic devices and circuits (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between time, space, energy, and accuracy in neuromorphic computation, which could be categorized under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The implementation of a neuromorphic Kalman filter for offline decoding of human vocal pitch from neural data is an application of the methods developed in the paper, which could be classified under the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
