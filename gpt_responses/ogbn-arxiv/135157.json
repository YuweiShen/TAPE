The use of number fields and cyclotomic fields suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory (cs.CC) and algebraic number theory (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of coset encoding and block fading wiretap channels suggests a possible connection to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
