This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves training a deep neural network, which suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves benchmarking and comparing the proposed method to other methods, which suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper involves text detection, which suggests that it could also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves image processing and analysis, which suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
