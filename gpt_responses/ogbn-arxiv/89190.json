Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also involves natural language processing, which suggests it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of deep learning models for multimodal feature fusion suggests it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves sharing weights and memory across modalities, which could suggest it belongs to cs.SD (Software Engineering) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
