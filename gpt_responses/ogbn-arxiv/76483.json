Information theory concepts such as outage probability and ergodic rate are used to evaluate the system performance. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of full-duplex relaying (FDR) in wireless networks and proposes a method to alleviate residual self-interference (RSI) using improper Gaussian signaling (IGS). \n3. cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks): The paper deals with the performance evaluation of a communication system using full-duplex relaying (FDR) and improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) over Nakagami-m fading channels. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method to optimize the relay signal parameters based on channel statistics to improve the system performance. This involves the use of control theory concepts. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the throughput performance of the proposed system and compares it with other relaying schemes, which is relevant to multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
