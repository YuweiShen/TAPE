It also involves deep learning, which makes it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
