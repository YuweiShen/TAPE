Information theory is closely related to these fields, and hence this category is the most likely. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper explicitly mentions the applications of negabent functions in cryptography, and hence this category is also likely. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with constructions of negabent functions, which involve certain binomial and trinomial permutations. This involves discrete mathematics, and hence this category is also likely. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the study of bent and negabent functions is closely related to this field. Hence, this category is also likely. \n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper does not deal with formal languages or automata theory, but the study of negabent functions involves algebraic structures and functions over finite fields, which are related to this field. Hence, this category is also likely, but less so than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
