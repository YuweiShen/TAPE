The paper proposes a method for training personalized models that leverage a collaboration graph, which is learned jointly with the models. This involves alternating between training nonlinear models given the graph and updating the collaboration graph given the models. The paper analyzes the convergence rate, memory and communication complexity of the approach, and demonstrates its benefits compared to competing techniques on synthetic and real datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
