The paper also discusses the use of feedback in optimization, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and control theory (cs.SY). The paper's focus on lower bounds and limitations of optimization algorithms is also relevant to the field of optimization theory (cs.OH). Finally, the paper's application to active learning suggests a connection to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
