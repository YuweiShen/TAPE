The paper introduces a new algorithm for this problem that is based on a complexity measure called supermodular degree, which measures deviation from submodularity. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with a fundamental problem in discrete optimization and introduces a new algorithm for it, which is likely to involve data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with the problem of maximizing a set function subject to constraints, which is a common problem in game theory and mechanism design.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's focus on optimization and approximation algorithms suggests that it may be relevant to the AI community, which often deals with optimization problems in various contexts.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper introduces a new complexity measure and analyzes the complexity of the algorithm in terms of this measure, which is likely to be of interest to the computational complexity community.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's focus on optimization and approximation algorithms suggests that it may be relevant to the machine learning community, which often deals with optimization"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
