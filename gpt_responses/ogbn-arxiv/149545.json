The proposed method involves the use of a modulated loss function, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI) to improve training stability and performance. The paper also discusses the issue of inconsistent parameter regression, which is a topic in both machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the experiments involve the use of various datasets, including aerial images (cs.MM), which are commonly used in computer vision research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
