The paper also mentions the use of eigenfunctions and random behavior, which are topics related to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of the oscillator system, which could potentially fall under the category of systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
