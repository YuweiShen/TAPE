The system also involves wireless networking (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY) for the optimization of the jamming power and beamforming vectors. Finally, the use of multiple antennas for improved performance falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
