Additionally, the paper proposes a symbolic technique for solving a safety game, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of automata constructions and the complexity analysis of the synthesis problem could also make the paper relevant to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) category. The paper's focus on single-agent systems and imperfect information could make it relevant to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category, particularly in the context of verification and synthesis of concurrent and distributed systems. Finally, the use of antichain-based techniques suggests a connection to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
