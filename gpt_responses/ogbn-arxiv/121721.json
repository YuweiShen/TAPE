Therefore, cs.OS is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses system-level policies and parameters, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.SY (systems and control) and cs.PF (performance). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a policy specification API, which could be considered under the sub-category of cs.AR (hardware architecture). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of EOS on Linux subsystems, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.PL (programming languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
