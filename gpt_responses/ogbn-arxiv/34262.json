This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the early stages of application development, specifically the UI prototyping phase. This involves designing interfaces that are user-friendly and intuitive, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed system uses a Deep Neural Network for automating the UI prototyping process. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed system involves training a Deep Neural Network on a custom database of hand-drawn sketches. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions a UI parser that creates code for different platforms based on the UI representation object generated by the Deep Neural Network. This involves retrieving relevant information from the UI representation object, which falls under the domain of information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
