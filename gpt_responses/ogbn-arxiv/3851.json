The use of deep learning models and feature aggregation also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of 3D scans and the focus on medical imaging may suggest the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques to improve performance may suggest the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
