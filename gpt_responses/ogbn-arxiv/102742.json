The proposed technique involves building unsupervised document embeddings, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained word embeddings, which is a popular approach in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve textual similarity tasks, which can be related to computer vision (cs.CV) in terms of measuring similarity between images or visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
