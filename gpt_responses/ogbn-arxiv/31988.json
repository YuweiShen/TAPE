The use of utility functions and welfare maximization also suggests a connection to decision theory and optimization, which are relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the focus on voting rules and participation may relate to social choice theory (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
