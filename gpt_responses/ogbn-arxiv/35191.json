The authors propose a signaling mechanism to improve the efficiency of the detection system, which involves real-time warnings to users and selective auditing of suspicious accesses. This mechanism relies on machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an access being audited, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the properties of Stackelberg equilibria in the signaling audit game, which is a topic in game theory and optimization (cs.LG). Additionally, the authors mention the use of data analytics and statistical methods to analyze real access events in a medical center, which could be classified under cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
