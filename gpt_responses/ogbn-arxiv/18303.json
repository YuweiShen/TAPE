The use of meshes suggests that the paper is related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DS). The focus on memory performance and cache-obliviousness suggests that the paper is related to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and systems and control (cs.SC). Finally, the use of algorithms to find optimal layouts suggests that the paper is related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
