This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses communication aspects of the system, such as co-polarization and dual-polarization antennas, which further supports the inclusion of cs.COMM (communication and networking) as a likely sub-category. The iterative algorithm proposed in the paper involves optimization of multiple parameters, which can be seen as a control systems problem, thus making cs.SY (systems and control) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper includes simulation results that involve multimedia traffic, which could potentially place it under cs.MM (multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
