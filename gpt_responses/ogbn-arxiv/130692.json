The paper proposes methods for adapting neural machine translation systems to new, low-resourced languages, which is a common problem in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses training strategies and regularization techniques, which are common topics in machine learning, particularly in deep learning. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI another possible sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of massively multilingual models, which can be related to neural architecture search and optimization, falling under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of image captioning as an application of machine translation, which can be related to computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
