The use of game theory to model the behavior of stations and relays suggests that the paper could also belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) category. The focus on preventing selfish behavior and preserving appropriate QoS suggests that the paper could also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. The use of reputation-based incentives suggests that the paper could also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category.
