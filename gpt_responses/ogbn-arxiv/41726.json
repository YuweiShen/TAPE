The proposed method uses a genetic algorithm to automatically evolve CNN architectures, which involves optimization and search techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of ResNet and DenseNet blocks, which are specific architectures commonly used in deep learning and neural networks. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and efficiency, which are metrics relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
