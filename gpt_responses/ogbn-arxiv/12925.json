The paper also employs domain adaptation and illumination-invariant image per-transformation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper's focus on automotive applications suggests that it may also fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on challenging datasets, which may also place it under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
