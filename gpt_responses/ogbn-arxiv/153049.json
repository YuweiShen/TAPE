The use of the pi calculus and cryptographic primitives suggests a focus on formal methods and logic (cs.LO), while the translation into Horn clauses points to program analysis and verification (cs.PL). The fact that the technique is fully automatic and efficient in practice suggests a focus on software engineering and systems (cs.SE), while the extension of a previous technique for the verification of secrecy suggests a focus on formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
