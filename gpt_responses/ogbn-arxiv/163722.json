The paper also involves algebraic geometry and representation theory, which are relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The use of obstructions and orbit closures suggests a connection to logic and set theory (cs.LO), and the mention of the Borel-Weil theorem suggests a connection to group theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
