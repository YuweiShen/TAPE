The proposed algorithm involves compressive sensing techniques, which are often studied in the information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. The use of multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) is also a key aspect of the paper, which is a topic of interest in the statistical inference (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also includes a stopping criterion based on the overestimating probability of the model order, which is related to optimization and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the numerical results involve computation complexity analysis, which is a topic of interest in the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
