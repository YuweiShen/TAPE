The paper also discusses the use of DNNs in smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a new compression method that takes advantage of the deep cascaded information process mechanism of DNN architecture, which is related to deep learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
