The use of deep learning models for this task also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of residual networks, which are a type of neural network architecture commonly used in deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
