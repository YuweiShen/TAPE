The method uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) network and a differentiable exponentiation layer with a symmetric loss function to constrain transformations to be diffeomorphic. The evaluation is performed on 330 cardiac MR sequences, and the model's abilities to transport pathological deformations to healthy subjects and to cluster five diseases in the unsupervised deformation encoding space are illustrated. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information theory (cs.IT), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
