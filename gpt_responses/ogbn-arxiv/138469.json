The paper also proposes a novel framework for fact discovery, which involves decomposing the problem into several components, suggesting a focus on database systems (cs.DB) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of auto-encoders and feedback learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
