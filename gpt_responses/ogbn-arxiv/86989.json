The use of Vandermonde matrices and Hilbert's inequality suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) perspective. The focus on deterministic, finite sample size, and finite-SNR performance analysis suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. Finally, the use of upper bounds and inequalities suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
