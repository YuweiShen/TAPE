This involves combining two main ideas: mining code fragments from partially-successful programs and using angelic conditions as placeholders for control structure conditions. The paper also demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages), followed by cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
