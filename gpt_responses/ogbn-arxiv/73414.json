The use of polynomials and grids suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). The focus on local decoding and testing suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of hypercontractivity and symmetries suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
