The paper discusses the use of non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms for this problem, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of machine learning known as online learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which are relevant to the optimization and computational aspects of the problem. The paper also discusses the use of regularization, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical methods (cs.ST), making these sub-categories also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
