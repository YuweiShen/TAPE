The focus is on the complexity of the codes, which suggests that it could also belong to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of large kernels in the construction of the codes could also make it relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents results on the performance of the codes for specific channels, which could make it relevant to the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
