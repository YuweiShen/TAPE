The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The hierarchical approach to object detection could also place it in the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks and deep learning techniques could also suggest that it belongs to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
