This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of learned system models with gradient-based model predictive control algorithms, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper uses neural networks to compute autonomous control policies, which is a common application of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
