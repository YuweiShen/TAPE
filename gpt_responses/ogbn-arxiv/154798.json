It also addresses the immutability of blocks and contracts, which relates to the security and cryptography (cs.CR) category. The use of blockchain technology also involves distributed computing (cs.DC) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the need for new standard models to address the arising issues suggests a focus on systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
