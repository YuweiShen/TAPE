This is a common problem in wireless communication and falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a practical solution with low computational complexity and signalling overhead, which involves optimization and algorithm design, falling under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed solution through extensive simulation, which involves statistical analysis and performance evaluation, falling under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
