The paper also discusses the use of eXtended Finite State Machines (XFSM) as a low-level programming abstraction, which is related to the field of computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also addresses platform independence, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses limitations and extensions, which is related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
