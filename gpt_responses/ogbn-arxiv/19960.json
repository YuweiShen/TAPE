The analysis of 4000 mobile service ideas collected from common people suggests that consumers' technology foresight horizon is limited by the existing technological base. This finding is relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category, which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. The paper also highlights the challenge of analyzing a vast number of ideas cost-effectively, which is relevant to the cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category, which deals with the study of communication and control processes in complex systems. The use of collaborative research methods to collect ideas from a large number of people is relevant to the social and information sciences (cs.SI) sub-category, which deals with the study of social and information phenomena using computational methods. The analysis of the idea database to identify ideas that can be realized utilizing existing technologies is relevant to the computer and society (cs.CC) sub-category, which deals with the social and ethical implications of computing technologies. Finally, the use of text analysis techniques to analyze the idea database is relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category, which deals with the development of algorithms and systems for searching and retrieving information from large collections of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
