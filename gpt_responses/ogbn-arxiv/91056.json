The paper also discusses the use of resources and parallelism, which relates to distributed systems (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper introduces a framework for categorizing ranking predictions, which could be relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
