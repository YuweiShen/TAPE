Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and machine learning. The paper also involves training NMT models, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the use of uncertainty measures is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) research. Finally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of NMT models suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
