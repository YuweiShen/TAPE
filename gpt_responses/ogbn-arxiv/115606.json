The use of a classification network and the focus on achieving state-of-the-art results also suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are likely sub-categories. The mention of runtime and GPU usage suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the mention of improving the AP (average precision) suggests that cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) may be a relevant sub-category, as AP is a common metric in evaluating the performance of detection algorithms in security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
