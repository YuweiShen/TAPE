This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including: \n\n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category deals with research related to sound and audio processing, which is directly relevant to the proposed keyword spotting model in this paper. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with research related to natural language processing, which is also relevant to the proposed model since it involves detecting keywords in spoken language. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with research related to machine learning, which is the underlying technology used in the proposed model. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with research related to artificial intelligence, which is also relevant to the proposed model since it involves using machine learning to detect keywords in spoken language. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with research related to computer vision and pattern recognition, which may be less relevant but could potentially be related to the visual representation of spoken language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
