Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI. The paper also discusses the pre-installed collection of AI development tools, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of computer vision techniques to extract information from the game, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the deployment of StarCraft AIs on multiple hosts, which could be related to cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
