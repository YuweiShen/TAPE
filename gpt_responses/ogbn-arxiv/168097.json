The paper also uses a semantic framework for default and autoepistemic logics, which falls under computational linguistics (cs.CL) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and strengths of different approaches to formalizing autoepistemic reasoning, which could be relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
