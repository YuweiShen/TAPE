These topics are typically studied in the areas of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.CG). The paper also involves complexity analysis and parameterized algorithms, which are common in theoretical computer science (cs.TC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of structural characterization of graphs, which is a topic studied in computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
