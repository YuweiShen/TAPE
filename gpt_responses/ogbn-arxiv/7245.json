The use of deep learning models such as Multi-dimensional LSTMs and convolutional networks also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the subfields of natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of Beam Search algorithm for decoding and Focal Loss for addressing class imbalance problem suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
