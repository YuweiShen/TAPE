This involves software engineering practices such as designing, implementing, and testing the system. \n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques for automatically detecting and correcting transaction errors. The authors discuss the ML models used and their performance evaluation. \n\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the central servers where retail transactions are sent for validation and other business operations. This involves database management and querying. \n\n4. cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity): The paper discusses the potential risks of manual error correction, which may lead to further errors and security vulnerabilities. The proposed automated system can improve the security of retail transactions. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Similar to cs.CYBER, the paper discusses the potential security risks of manual error correction and proposes an automated system to mitigate these risks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
