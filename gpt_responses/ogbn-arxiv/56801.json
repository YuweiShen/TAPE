The paper proposes a method to control the length of the generated summary, which involves modifying the positional encoding used in the neural encoder-decoder model. This makes it likely that the paper could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the proposed method could potentially be applied to computer vision tasks that involve generating output sequences of a desired length, such as image captioning, which would make computer vision (cs.CV) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
