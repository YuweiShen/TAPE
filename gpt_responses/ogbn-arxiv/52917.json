This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with hiding information in images for secure communication. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of image processing techniques (cs.CV) and the use of neural networks (cs.LG) for steganography. The paper also proposes new architectures for the 3 player game, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.AI) for embedding and extracting hidden information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
