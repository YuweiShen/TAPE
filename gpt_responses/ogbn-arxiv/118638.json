The use of LP relaxations and iterative rounding techniques suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant. The problem of node connectivity is a fundamental topic in graph theory (cs.GT), and the paper presents approximation algorithms for this problem, which is also related to approximation algorithms (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
