The use of infrared imaging is a key focus of the paper, which suggests that it may also fall under the subcategories of machine learning (cs.MM) and image processing (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the potential applications of infrared face recognition in law enforcement, which could place it under the subcategory of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Lastly, the paper discusses the databases of infrared facial images available to researchers, which suggests that it may also fall under the subcategory of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
