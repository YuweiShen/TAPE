The use of the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm are also commonly used in information theory. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of LASSO regularization and the Bernoulli non-negative Gaussian-mixture signal prior are commonly used in machine learning. \n3. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The problem of recovering a sparse signal from noisy linear measurements is a classic problem in signal processing. The use of the GAMP algorithm is also commonly used in signal processing. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The problem of compressive imaging is a common problem in computer vision. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The problem of portfolio optimization can be seen as a problem in social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
