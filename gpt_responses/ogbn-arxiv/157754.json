It combines machine learning techniques with declarative rules called \"matching dependencies\" to detect and merge duplicate representations of external entities. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of databases (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it deals with data cleaning and merging, which are relevant to these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
