The paper also discusses experiments and extensions to reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also touches on control engineering (cs.SY) and computational engineering (cs.CE) due to its focus on reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
