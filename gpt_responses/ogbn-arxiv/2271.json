The specific bases considered in the paper are Fourier and canonical bases, which are commonly used in signal processing and image analysis (cs.SP, cs.LG). The paper also introduces a polynomial complexity algorithm for finding sparse representations, which involves optimization and numerical methods (cs.MM, cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
