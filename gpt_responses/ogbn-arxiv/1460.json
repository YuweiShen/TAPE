The focus is on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and Extreme Programming (XP), which are both related to software development (cs.SD). The proposed architecture is a combination of MDA and XP, which involves programming languages (cs.PL) and database management (cs.DB). The case study of implementing the proposed architecture on an online polling system also involves cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
