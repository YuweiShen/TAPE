The paper also discusses the effective average symmetric capacity and block error probability, which are concepts related to signal processing and communication (cs.SI). The use of Ar{\\i}kan's channel polarization transformation and certain permutations suggests a focus on coding theory (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the encoding and decoding complexities, which are topics in computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses numerical upper bounds, which could be related to machine learning or optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
