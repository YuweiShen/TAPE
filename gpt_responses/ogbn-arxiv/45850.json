The paper also discusses image reconstruction methods for downstream vision applications, which further supports the likelihood of it belonging to the computer vision sub-category. Additionally, the use of event cameras in robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) may also be relevant to this work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
