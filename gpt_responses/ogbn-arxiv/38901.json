The paper discusses various techniques for generating negative training examples and proposes a new method inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). The paper also evaluates the proposed framework on three knowledge base completion datasets using link prediction task. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with improving the performance of models using adversarial learning. The other likely sub-categories are cs.DB (Databases), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the paper deals with knowledge graph embeddings and link prediction tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
