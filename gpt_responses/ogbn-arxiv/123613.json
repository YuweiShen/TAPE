Given that the paper focuses on improving the performance of deep Bayesian active learning methods for image classification by using model ensembles, it is most likely to belong to cs.LG and cs.CV. However, since the paper also discusses the challenges of obtaining labeled data in specialized domains such as healthcare, it could also be relevant to cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
