It also involves deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper mentions the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) in the introduction, but the main focus is on visual recognition. Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE) for few-shot learning, which is a key aspect of the work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
