This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses interference management (cs.SI) and communication complexity (cs.CC) in the context of the symmetric K-user interference channel. Additionally, the paper uses mathematical modeling and analysis (cs.MM) to derive its results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
