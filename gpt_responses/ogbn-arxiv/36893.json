The use of deep learning algorithms and pre-trained models suggests that it may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The mention of Zero-Shot Action Recognition (ZSAR) indicates that it may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of self-attention models and graph network models suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
