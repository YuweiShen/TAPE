The use of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) and labeled failures is a specific technique within this area, which could also place the paper in the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The algorithms presented in the paper involve machine learning techniques, which could also justify the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with error handling and fault tolerance, which could also place it in the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
