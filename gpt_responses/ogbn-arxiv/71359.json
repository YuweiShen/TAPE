The paper also proposes a new architectural design for graph-based learning, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Laplace-Beltrami operator and diffusion kernels is related to graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the improvement in semantic classification suggests the use of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
