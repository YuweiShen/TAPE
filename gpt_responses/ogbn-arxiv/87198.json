The model uses amortized variational inference to train the generative model end-to-end. The learned representations of object location and appearance are fully disentangled, and objects are represented independently of each other in the latent space. The paper focuses on computer vision and machine learning, which suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
