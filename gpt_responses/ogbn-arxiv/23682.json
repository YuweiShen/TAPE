It proposes a specific notion of multiplicity called predictive multiplicity, which reflects irreconcilable differences in the predictions of models with comparable performance. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it deals with the effects of multiplicity in machine learning. It also deals with issues related to privacy and security (cs.CR) as it discusses the challenges in model selection and local explanation. Additionally, the paper proposes measures to evaluate predictive multiplicity, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on a large collection of recidivism prediction problems, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
