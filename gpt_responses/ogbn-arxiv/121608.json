The paper also focuses on the user and context-focused aspects of explanations, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper covers various types of knowledge-enabled systems, including expert systems and semantic applications, which are subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL), respectively. Finally, the paper proposes new definitions for explanations and explainable knowledge-enabled systems, which could be relevant to the field of cybersecurity (cs.CY) where explainability is important for detecting and preventing attacks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
