The proposed model uses a segment-level recurrent network, which is a type of neural network commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The dataset used in the paper is a collection of instructional videos, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of the generated segments for dense video captioning and event parsing, which are tasks related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
