However, given that the paper focuses on the design of cooperative MIMO precoding algorithms, it is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. Other likely sub-categories include Networked Systems (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG), as the paper involves the design of algorithms that operate in a distributed and hierarchical setting, and that rely on statistical and optimization techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
