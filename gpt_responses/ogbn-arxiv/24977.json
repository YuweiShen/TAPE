Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of learning IRT models using DNN-generated data, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a use-case for latent difficulty item parameters, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the qualitative and quantitative analyses for two NLP tasks, which can be categorized under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
