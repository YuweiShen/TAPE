This is a common topic in logic in computer science. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper mentions uncertainty measures as a basis for deciding among multiple defaults, which is a common topic in cryptography and security. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses algorithms and heuristics for finding the optimal defaults, which is a common topic in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes an extension to a previously proposed system for reasoning with uncertainty, which is a common topic in programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
