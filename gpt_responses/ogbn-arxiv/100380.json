It also involves the use of textual patterns and distributional representations, which are common techniques in NLP. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it involves the development of a new framework for hypernymy inference.
