The paper also discusses the implementation of force control schemes and the evaluation of their performance, which could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The need for a robust controller and constant supervision from a human operator suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of force control for contact-rich manipulation tasks could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) for object recognition and tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
