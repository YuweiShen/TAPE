The paper also introduces a novel metric for ranking instances based on the weighted scores. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, since the focus is on learning weights for classifier fusion, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category. The other sub-categories are also relevant because the paper discusses applications in image classification and text classification, which are common in computer vision, information retrieval, and computational linguistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
