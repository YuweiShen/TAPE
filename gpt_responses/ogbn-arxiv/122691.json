Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of linear projections and seed dictionaries, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning, respectively. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates the embeddings on a specific task (Curriculum Vitae parsing), which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
