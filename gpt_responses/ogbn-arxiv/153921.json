The paper also mentions the optimal probabilistic problem solving strategy, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses how the results can be applied to designing more human-like agents, which falls under the scope of neural networks (cs.NE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
