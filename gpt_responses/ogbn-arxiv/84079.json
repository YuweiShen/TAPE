This involves finding a joint compact description of data coming from all the modalities and defining a separate transformation for each modality to map the data from the corresponding feature space to the new optimized subspace. The method is evaluated on multimodal datasets and compared with baseline and recently proposed one-class classification methods. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper deals with classification and feature extraction. The sub-categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are also likely as the paper deals with multimodal data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
