The paper proposes new algorithms for achieving asymptotic consensus in high-dimensional systems with directed communication graphs that may change over time. This makes the paper most likely to belong to the cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also deals with systems that model natural phenomena, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes new algorithms that have component-wise contraction rates that are constant in the number of agents, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also deals with the problem of achieving asymptotic consensus under weak connectivity assumptions, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes new algorithms that achieve convergence time linear in the number of agents, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
