As such, it is likely to fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also discusses the use of a cross-query loss to improve the robustness of the approach, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper's focus on tracking and object detection suggests a potential fit for Robotics (cs.RO) and Multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
