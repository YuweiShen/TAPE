This falls under the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. The use of high-resolution measurements and raw current and voltage waveforms suggests a focus on signal processing and data analysis, which are covered by the cs.SD sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed model on a publicly available dataset and the study of model stability suggest a focus on experimental validation and system analysis, which are covered by the cs.SY sub-category. Finally, the use of neural network ensembles suggests a focus on ensemble learning and model combination, which are covered by the cs.NE sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
