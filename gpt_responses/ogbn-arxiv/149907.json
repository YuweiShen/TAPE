The paper specifically discusses the relationship between word and frontier languages of unsafe higher-order grammars, which suggests that it is likely to be categorized under formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The paper also uses intersection types, which are a topic in programming languages (cs.PL), and discusses the application of the results to model checking and program verification (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper involves the study of order-n tree languages, which are a topic in formal language theory and data structures (cs.LO, cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
