Specifically, the paper focuses on the use of Multi-Layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (ML-VAMP) for output-to-input inference in deep networks. ML-VAMP is a method derived from expectation propagation, which is a technique used in information theory and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
