Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning, which is a common topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the support for distributed training, which is a common topic in cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
