It also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) aspects. The paper specifically focuses on the use of MMSE precoding/combining (cs.MM) and the impact of pilot contamination on capacity. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the results for communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
