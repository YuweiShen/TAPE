The paper specifically focuses on row types and row polymorphism, which are also relevant to the Types (cs.TYPES) sub-category. The use of scoped labels and the development of a blame calculus suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LG) sub-category. The discussion of type soundness and conservativity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the use of casts and run-time checking suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
