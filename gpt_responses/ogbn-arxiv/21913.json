The algorithm uses reinforcement learning (RL) and a model-checker to ensure safety guarantees, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a belief update technique using a learning-based approach to make the decision strategy robust to perception errors and occlusions, which involves computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper uses a scene decomposition approach to scale the algorithm to environments with multiple traffic participants, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
