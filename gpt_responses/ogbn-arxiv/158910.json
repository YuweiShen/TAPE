The use of mathematical tools and pattern finding also suggests the possibility of information theory (cs.IT) being a relevant sub-category. The development of an algorithm and use of block chaining modes of operation indicate the involvement of computer communication (cs.CC) and security and privacy (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of shared key cryptosystems and digital enveloping suggests the involvement of software engineering (cs.SE) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
