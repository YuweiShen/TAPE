The paper also discusses tradeoffs between time, label size, message length, and computation space, which are relevant topics in Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Networked Systems (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper introduces a new notion of $t$-PLS, which involves analyzing the tradeoffs between time and space, and proving lower bounds for space-time tradeoffs, which are topics in Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
