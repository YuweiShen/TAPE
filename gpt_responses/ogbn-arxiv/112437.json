The proposed approach is specifically designed for continuous domain adaptation, which involves adapting to new domains while maintaining previously learned knowledge. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
