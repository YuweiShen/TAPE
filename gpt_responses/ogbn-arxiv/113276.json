The paper discusses the problem of sharing multiple secrets among a group of people, which falls under the category of \"multi-party computation\" or \"secure multi-party computation\". This topic is closely related to cryptography and information theory, which are covered in the sub-categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves the use of algorithms and data structures to implement the secret sharing scheme, which falls under the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses the theoretical bounds and complexity of the scheme, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
