Additionally, the paper focuses on optimizing the performance of these DL applications, which could also place it in the cs.DC sub-category. The specific DL applications mentioned in the abstract, such as image recognition and language processing, suggest that the paper could also be categorized under cs.CV and cs.CL, respectively. Finally, the use of benchmarks to guide the design of future computing infrastructure could place the paper in the cs.LG sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
