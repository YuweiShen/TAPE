This falls under the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SD) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). The use of artificial neural networks for classification also suggests the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the mutual information-based assessment of the features suggests the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT) as well, but this is less likely than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
