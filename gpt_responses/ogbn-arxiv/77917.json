The use of combinatorial structures and analysis suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The conversion of query-based algorithms to sample-based algorithms involves information theory (cs.IT). The scalability of multi-testing is a topic in machine learning and statistics, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also deals with the security implications of converting a Merlin-Arthur Proximity proof to a proper testing algorithm, which suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
