This involves modeling the learning process via a structured prediction model in the space of functional maps. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with 3D shape correspondence. The paper also deals with graphics (cs.GR) as it involves modeling 3D shapes. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses a deep residual network for learning. The paper also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with structured prediction models. Finally, the paper involves neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) as it uses a deep residual network for learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
