This is a subfield of sound processing and analysis, making cs.SD the most likely category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper also involves language processing, as it deals with speech signals and their analysis. However, the focus is more on the signal processing aspect rather than natural language processing, so cs.CL is less likely than cs.SD.\n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper is primarily concerned with signal processing techniques for detecting GCIs in speech signals, making cs.SI a likely category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While machine learning techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, some of the detection algorithms may involve machine learning or statistical modeling. Therefore, cs.LG is a possible category.\n- cs.SDQ (Sound and Music Computing): This subcategory is specifically focused on sound and music processing, which is a subset of cs.SD. While the paper is primarily concerned with speech processing, it may still fall under cs.SDQ due to its focus on sound analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
