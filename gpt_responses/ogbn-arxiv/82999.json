The paper discusses the application of this framework to discourse-level annotations of text and speech data, and demonstrates how it can be used to represent hybrid multi-level structures derived from diverse file formats. The paper also highlights the potential for using annotation graphs to facilitate comparison of multiple annotations based on different theoretical models, and for integrating tools, formats, and corpora. Given this focus on linguistic data analysis and natural language processing, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
