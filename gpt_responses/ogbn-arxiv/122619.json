This involves creating sub-classifiers to learn different aspects from different source and target concepts over time. The approach is evaluated on several synthetic data streams containing different types of concept drift and on real world data streams. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Computer vision (cs.CV) and social and information networks (cs.SI) are also possible sub-categories, as the approach may have applications in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
