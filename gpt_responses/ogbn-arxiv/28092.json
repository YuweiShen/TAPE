The proposed techniques involve improving the robustness of CNN features, which is a common goal in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using triplet loss, which is a common technique in metric learning (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper involves improving the discriminative power of the learned representations, which is a common goal in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with surveillance videos and occlusion, which are common topics in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
