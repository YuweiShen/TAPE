This involves extracting channel features and generating channel charts using tools from dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, and deep neural networks. The proposed method has applications in UE localization, network planning, user scheduling, multipoint connectivity, hand-over, cell search, user grouping, and other cognitive tasks that rely on CSI and UE movement relative to the base-station. Given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the proposed framework involves learning and processing large amounts of data using advanced techniques from machine learning and control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
