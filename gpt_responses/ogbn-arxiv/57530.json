The technique involves sparsifying the gradient vectors and eliminating rarely updated rows or columns, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE) tasks. The paper also discusses the computational cost reduction, which is related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
