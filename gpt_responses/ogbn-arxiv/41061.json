Additionally, the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) engines suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The consideration of dynamic pricing models and user request information suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) aspect. Finally, the use of a hierarchical and hybrid approach may also suggest a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
