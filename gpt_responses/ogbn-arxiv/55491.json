The paper focuses on selecting and replaying sequences of transitions to accelerate the learning of a reinforcement learning agent, which is a technique used in deep reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics), as these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of reinforcement learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of this approach in various applications and situations, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
