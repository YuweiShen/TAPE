The paper proposes a solution to this problem. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, PEGs are a formalism that can be used for natural language processing and other tasks related to machine learning. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): Similar to cs.LG, PEGs can be used for natural language processing, which falls under the scope of cs.CL. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): PEGs are a formalism used to describe parsers, which can be seen as a form of symbolic computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
