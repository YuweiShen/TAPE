Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the second likely category. The paper also deals with identifying the source of digital media, which involves cryptography and security, suggesting cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as the third likely category.
