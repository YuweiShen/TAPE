The specific focus on qubit entanglement suggests a connection to quantum computing, which is often categorized under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.QA (Quantum Algebra). The paper also discusses potential uses in cryptographic schemes, which falls under cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of graphical calculus and algebraic underpinnings suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
