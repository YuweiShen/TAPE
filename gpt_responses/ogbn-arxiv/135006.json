The paper also discusses the use of bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) schemes, which is a common technique used in wireless communication systems, making categories such as networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) relevant. Finally, the paper uses numerical simulations to demonstrate the phenomenon of threshold saturation, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
