The paper specifically focuses on the analysis of wide neural networks at large depths, which is a subfield of deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper also discusses the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which are related to the field of neural networks and could potentially fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
