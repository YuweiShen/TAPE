The use of latent-variable models suggests that the paper could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The focus on sequential decision making and control suggests that the paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
