The use of dark channel prior is a popular approach in this area, which suggests that the minimum intensity in a local patch of an image is likely to correspond to the atmospheric veil. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel weight map to control the local constant assumption, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
