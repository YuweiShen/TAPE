The paper proposes several graded schemes for weighting words based on their discriminatory relevance, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the use of ensemble methods and alternate classifiers, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the language-free aspects of the proposed models, which could be of interest in data-scarce languages such as Hindi (cs.CL, cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
