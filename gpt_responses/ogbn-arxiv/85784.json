Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper specifically mentions FPGAs and ASICs, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and autonomous systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper reviews deep learning frameworks (cs.LG) and discusses benchmarking principles for them. Finally, the paper mentions AR (augmented reality) briefly, which is also related to computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
