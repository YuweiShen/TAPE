Given that the paper focuses on understanding the mechanics of meta-learning and the difference between meta-learned models and classically trained models, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper also discusses visualizations and regularizers inspired by hypotheses, it could also belong to the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
