The effective capacity formulation, which is used to capture the throughput under queueing constraints, is a well-known concept in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is focused on wireless systems, which are an important part of networking and internet architecture. The study of different transmission strategies and their performance in the presence of queueing constraints is relevant to this sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the analysis of wireless systems under queueing constraints, which can be viewed as a control problem. The interactions between different system parameters (throughput, queueing constraints, coding blocklength, decoding error probabilities, and signal-to-noise ratio) can be analyzed using control theory techniques. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of data over wireless systems, which is relevant to multimedia applications. The study of different transmission strategies and their performance in the presence of queueing constraints can be important for multimedia applications that require high throughput and low delay. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but the study of decoding error probabilities is relevant to this sub-category.
