The paper also discusses the efficiency of the algorithm, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The application of the algorithm to informative POMDPs and near-discernible POMDPs suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of control systems (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
