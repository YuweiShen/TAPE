The paper discusses the occurrence of spurious local minima in these networks, which is a common topic in the field of machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also conducts experiments related to computer vision (cs.CV) and provides a theoretical analysis of the problem (cs.SI, Symbolic Computation and Algebraic Manipulation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
