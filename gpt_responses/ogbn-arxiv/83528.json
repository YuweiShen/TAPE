The paper also mentions the \\(\\mathcal{LOCAL}\\) model, which is a model for local computation, and thus the paper could also be categorized under Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of identifiers on local decision, which could also fall under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
