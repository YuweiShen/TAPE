It may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as the attack is based on the rank metric. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as the attack involves computational complexity analysis. It may also be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as the cryptosystems being attacked are used in network coding. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the attack involves algorithmic techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
