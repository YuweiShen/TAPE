This category is therefore highly relevant.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents lower bounds for polynomial optimization problems, which is a fundamental problem in algorithms and optimization. This category is also highly relevant.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The Sum-of-Squares/Lasserre hierarchy is a popular tool in machine learning for solving optimization problems, so this category is a possibility.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with optimization problems over binary polynomials, which is a discrete mathematical problem. This category is therefore a possibility.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This category deals with formal verification and validation, and the paper's focus on proving lower bounds for optimization problems could be relevant in this context."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
