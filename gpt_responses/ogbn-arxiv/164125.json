The use of linear programming and dual polynomials suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The Collision and Element Distinctness functions are classic problems in computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS), respectively, so these categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
