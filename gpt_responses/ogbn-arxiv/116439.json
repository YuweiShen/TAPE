The switching operation used in the paper is a combinatorial technique, which is also relevant to the sub-category of combinatorics and complexity (cs.CC). The classification of codes involves analyzing their properties and structures, which can be seen as a problem in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the construction of codes and their properties can have applications in various fields, such as communication systems and cryptography, which are relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
