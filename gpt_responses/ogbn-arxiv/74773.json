The paper also presents a program logic for reasoning about the behavior of weakly-isolated transactions, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the challenge of verifying high-level correctness properties in weakly-isolated environments, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also presents an inference procedure for ascertaining the weakest isolation level that still guarantees the safety of high-level consistency assertions, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the formal footing of weakly-isolated transactions, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
