The use of \"large margin learning\" also suggests that the paper may be related to support vector machines (SVMs), which are commonly used in both computer vision and machine learning. \"Compact binary image encodings\" suggests that the paper may be related to image compression or hashing, which are also common topics in computer vision and information retrieval (cs.IR).
