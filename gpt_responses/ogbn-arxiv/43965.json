The use of dominance relations and systematic derivation of solutions suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach to algorithm design. The Minimum Spanning Tree problem involves finding the most efficient way to connect nodes, which is a common problem in computational geometry (cs.CG). The Single Source Shortest Path problem is a classic problem in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG).
