The use of fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.CC (computational complexity) sub-categories. The mention of scheduling, stringology, and computational social choice also suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DM (discrete mathematics) or cs.LG (machine learning) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of oracles and treedepth suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.GT (computational geometry) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
