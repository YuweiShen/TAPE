The proposed algorithm is based on Bayesian learning, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves signal processing techniques, such as the Bussgang-like decomposition, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP). The algorithm is applicable to both single and multiple measurement vectors, which suggests that it could be relevant to the subfield of multiple measurement vectors (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves numerical simulations, which could be considered as a form of numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
