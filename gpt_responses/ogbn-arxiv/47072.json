This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a weakly supervised approach for part detection, which involves training the network with only image-level labels, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also uses region-based convolutional neural networks, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
