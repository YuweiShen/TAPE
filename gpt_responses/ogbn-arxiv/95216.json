The focus is on training the models using the triplet loss function, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of hand-engineered features, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of larger models and more training data, which are common topics in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
