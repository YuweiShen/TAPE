This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.Medical Imaging: The paper deals with medical imaging, specifically synthesizing CT images from MR images for accurate PET image reconstruction. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a deep neural network model to learn the transform of MR intensities to CT using patches. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach using deep learning for synthesizing CT images from MR images. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.NEURAL (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a neural network model for synthesizing CT images from MR images.
