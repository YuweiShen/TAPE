The paper discusses the learning dynamics of RL, which falls under the category of \"Learning\" in computer science. The paper also mentions the use of function approximation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also discusses the control of future data distribution by RL agents, which falls under the category of \"Robotics\" in computer science. This suggests that \"cs.RO\" (Robotics and Control) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of deep learning in RL, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. This suggests that \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the properties of saddle points, which is a concept in optimization theory. This suggests that \"cs.SY\" (Systems and Control) is another likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the learning dynamics of RL, which is a subfield of neural networks.
