The use of saliency maps and multi-channel CNN architecture also suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves improving performance over existing approaches, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
