The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to process visual images for navigation. The use of deep neural networks for learning the control policy falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of the Riemannian Motion Policy (RMP) framework, which is a control theory approach, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
