The paper also introduces a new framework for typing, which could potentially fall under logic in computer science (cs.LO) and type theory (cs.TP). Finally, the paper uses refinement typing, which is a technique commonly used in program analysis and verification (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
