The paper also discusses the algorithm's performance in terms of worst-case complexity (cs.CC) and its optimality for various distributions (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper introduces a new linear programming-based algorithm (cs.IT) and discusses the expected behavior of a randomized variant of the algorithm (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
