The use of bandit feedback also suggests a focus on reinforcement learning, which could place the paper in the Cybernetics (cs.CY) or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's use of simulated experiments with the RecoGym environment suggests a potential focus on natural language processing or computational linguistics, which could place it in the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
