Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as the paper proposes a new method to thwart backdoor attacks. The paper also deals with image sets and neural network architectures, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper uses tools from robust statistics, which could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
