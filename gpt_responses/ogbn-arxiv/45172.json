The use of certificate complexity, sensitivity, and block sensitivity suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The study of constructions of functions also suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
