The system's main functions include buffer analysis, overlay analysis, space convex hull calculation, space convex decomposition, 3D topology analysis, and 3D space intersection detection. The paper's focus on the use of virtual reality and multimodal human-computer interaction suggests that it could be categorized under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.VE (Virtual Environments). The use of 3D geographical information system and 3D visualization suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.GEO (Geography). Finally, the paper's focus on learning suggests that it could be categorized under cs.EDU (Education)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
