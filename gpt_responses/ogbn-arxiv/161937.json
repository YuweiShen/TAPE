This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes an efficient Bottleneck-LSTM layer, which could be considered a contribution to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with video processing (cs.MM) and optimization of computational cost (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
