Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel approach that involves optimization techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the characteristics of rain streaks and clean videos, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics). The proposed method involves minimizing different norms, which could be related to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
