The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning and feature extraction, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a Mahalanobis distance metric, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
