Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the use of fully learnable activation basis functions, which falls under the category of machine learning and deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) the second most likely category. The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a likely category. The paper also discusses the integration of RBFs into complex deep neural network architectures, which falls under the category of systems and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of automated activation function learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
