Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the development of two convolutional neural networks, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of cameras for monitoring pilgrims, which relates to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves the use of a dataset for the detection of pilgrims, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
