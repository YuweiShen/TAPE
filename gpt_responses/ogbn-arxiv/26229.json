Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, which suggests that it could also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of evaluation metrics, which could place it under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper focuses on Southern African languages, which could potentially place it under cs.CY (Computers and Society) as it relates to the study of language and culture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
