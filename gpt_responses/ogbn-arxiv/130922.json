The paper introduces novel change of measure inequalities for two families of divergences, which are commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also presents several PAC-Bayesian bounds for various classes of random variables, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
