The model uses a neural network to map patient history to edge weights in a dynamic graph, which is then used to model the temporal relationships between comorbid diseases. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational epidemiology (cs.SI), as well as potentially database systems (cs.DB) and computer engineering (cs.CE) for implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
