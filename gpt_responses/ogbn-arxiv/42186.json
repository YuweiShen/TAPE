This involves signal processing, communication theory, and control theory, which are all related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of low-cost sensors for real-time attitude information, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also involves the use of dynamic isolation and stabilization, which are related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes an array structure based simultaneous perturbation algorithm, which falls under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
