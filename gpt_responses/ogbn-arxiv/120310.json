The proposed Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (AP-CNN) is an end-to-end trainable model that learns both high-level semantic and low-level detailed feature representation, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of ROI guided refinement strategy, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
