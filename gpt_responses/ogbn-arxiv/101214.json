This involves training discriminative and generative models concurrently in an adversarial manner. The models are structured as deep subnetworks of hidden layers comprised of convolutional or recurrent computational units. The paper also validates the models on a data set of human movements recorded with an optical motion tracker. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also involves aspects of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
