The paper involves computer vision (CV) techniques for estimating occupancy state of the world and constructing top-down 2D global maps from egocentric views. It also involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for updating belief of the global map based on local observations using a recurrent neural network and augmenting the local mapping with a novel external memory. The paper also involves machine learning (LG) techniques for learning to predict free space based on egocentric views efficiently in an end-to-end manner. Finally, the paper involves robotics (RO) techniques for dealing with continuous actions and states, which is vitally important for robotic control in real applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
