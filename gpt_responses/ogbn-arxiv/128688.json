The paper proposes a novel heuristic algorithm for coalition formation, which involves optimization and decision-making, indicating the relevance of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) suggests the relevance of machine learning (cs.LG) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
