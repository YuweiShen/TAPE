The paper also mentions the use of joint decoding, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI). The modification to the decoding process may also have implications for signal processing (cs.SI) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper briefly discusses an extension to multiple relays, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) if the relays are transmitting multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
