It also involves the concept of binding structure and the decomposition of lambda terms, which are relevant to programming languages and semantics (cs.PL). The use of rewrite systems and the analysis of regularity suggest a connection to formal language theory (cs.TL) and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper deals with the characterization of infinite lambda terms, which could be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
