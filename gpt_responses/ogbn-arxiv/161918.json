This problem is closely related to compressive sensing (CS) and falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes a modified version of CS, which involves solving a convex relaxation problem, and hence falls under the category of optimization (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses an extension of the proposed method that uses prior signal estimate knowledge, which falls under the category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
