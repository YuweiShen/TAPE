The paper also discusses the use of stopping conditions in runtime analysis, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of resampling, which is a common technique in statistics and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the evaluation of algorithms, which is a common topic in data science (cs.DS).
