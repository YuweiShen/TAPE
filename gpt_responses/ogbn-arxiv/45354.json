This involves integrating the effort spent in training the constituent classifiers, which is a common problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper presents a heuristic approach and a principled graphical model to aggregate the label predictions by grounding them into the available taxonomy. The experimental validation is done on image and text classification tasks, which are common applications of machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
