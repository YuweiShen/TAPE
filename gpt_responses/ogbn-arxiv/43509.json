The paper also discusses the encoding and decoding complexity of the proposed scheme, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The simulations conducted in the paper involve multimedia data, which could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the asymptotic analysis of the proposed scheme, which could be categorized under statistical theory (cs.ST) or theoretical computer science (cs.THE). However, since the paper primarily deals with wireless multicast and network coding, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
