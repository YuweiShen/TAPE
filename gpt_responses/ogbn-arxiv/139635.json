This involves concepts such as beam-management, beamforming, and Doppler precompensation, which are related to network infrastructure and communication protocols. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves signal processing and estimation techniques for low-latency intercarrier interference (ICI) compensation, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of location information for efficient network management, which could be related to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
