This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and sum-rate, making cs.IT a likely category. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed framework is designed for accommodating multiple users with various angles of departures (AODs), which is a networking and communication problem. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of mmWave systems in the proposed framework suggests a multimedia application, such as high-speed data transmission or video streaming. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper analyzes the performance of the proposed framework and derives sufficient and necessary conditions for antenna allocation, which involves system design and control. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): This category is less likely, but the paper may have implications for society in terms of improving wireless communication and enabling faster and more efficient data transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
