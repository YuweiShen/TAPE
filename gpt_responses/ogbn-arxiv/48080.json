Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the use of channel models and power allocation, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also evaluates the system-level performance gains of FD small cells, which can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper involves the use of stochastic models, which can be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the effect of self-interference cancellation, which can be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
