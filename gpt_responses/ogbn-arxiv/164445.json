Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of PAM constellations, which are related to digital signal processing and could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SI (Signal Processing). Finally, the paper discusses the design of constellations with low complexity detectors, which could also be related to networked systems and could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
