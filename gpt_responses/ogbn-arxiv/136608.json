The proposed algorithm is based on the expectation consistent framework, which is a popular approach in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions compressed sensing, which is a subfield of mathematics and computer science (cs.MM). Finally, the numerical results involve simulations, which are often used in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
