The method involves training a meta-robot with DRL and transferring the meta-skill to a robot with a different dimensional configuration, which involves machine learning (cs.AI) and control theory (cs.SY). The approach also involves using observations and control policies, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
