The use of an instance memory to retain information about already segmented vertebrae is a form of memory-based learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The iterative approach to analyzing image patches is a form of active learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the method on spine CT scans and low-dose chest CT scans involves medical imaging, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and medical imaging analysis (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
