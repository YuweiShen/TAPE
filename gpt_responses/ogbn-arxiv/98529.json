The paper also introduces a new language extension for WebAssembly, which falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. The language extension is designed to ensure constant-time execution, which is a property of real-time systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes a formal proof of the language's security properties, which falls under the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
