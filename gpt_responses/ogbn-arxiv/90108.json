This topic falls under the area of database systems (cs.DB) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses indexing and storage structures for efficient join processing, which is related to data structures (cs.DS). The evaluation of the proposed technique is based on benchmarks, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
