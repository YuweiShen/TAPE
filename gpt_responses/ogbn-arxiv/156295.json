Therefore, cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorics and algebraic structures, which suggest that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses numerical parameters and estimates, which could place it in cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
