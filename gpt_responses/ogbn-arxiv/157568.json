The use of linearized polynomials and regenerating codes in distributed storage systems suggests a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer networks (cs.CC). The paper also introduces a new repairing rate to characterize the performance and efficiency of the repairing function, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
