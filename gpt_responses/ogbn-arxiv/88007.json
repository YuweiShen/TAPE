This topic is relevant to several sub-categories, including database systems (cs.DB), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.AR), and systems and control (cs.SY). However, since the paper focuses on storage optimization and performance enhancement, we can prioritize cs.DB and cs.SY as the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.DS and cs.LG, and cs.AR as the least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
