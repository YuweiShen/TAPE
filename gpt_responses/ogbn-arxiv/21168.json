The use of probabilistic caching schemes and interference models suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The clustering of devices and the optimization of cache offloading gain may be of interest to researchers in social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the joint optimization of communication and caching may involve game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
