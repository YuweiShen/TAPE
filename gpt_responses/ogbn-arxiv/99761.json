Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also considers the delivery phase, which involves network infrastructure, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely sub-category. The paper presents optimal caching and delivery strategies, which involve algorithms and data structures, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category. The paper also involves optimization, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of centralized coded caching, which involves distributed systems, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
