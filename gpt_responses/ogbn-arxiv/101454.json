The use of deep learning models such as Inception V3 and VGG19 networks for feature extraction and SVM classification for pose detection suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the proposed system for generating cricket highlights indicates that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
