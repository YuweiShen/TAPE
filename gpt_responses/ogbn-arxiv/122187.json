The proposed method involves building a discrete approximation of a navigation function, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the method on tasks involving clutter, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV). The method involves informed sampling-based planning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the method involves exploring alternative paths over time, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
