The paper discusses the use of statistical and risk management concepts to develop a more flexible and potentially optimal approach to centering and scaling within the Batch Normalization transformation. The paper includes experiments with image classification tasks, suggesting that the proposed approach can accelerate training and improve error rates. Given the focus on deep learning and computer vision, as well as the use of statistical and risk management concepts, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.AI. The paper also discusses the use of ReLU non-linearity, which suggests a potential connection to neural engineering (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
