Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of coding techniques, which falls under the sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of handover mechanisms, which could fall under the sub-category cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing IP core networks, which could fall under the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper discusses the dissemination of traffic in a multicast fashion, which could fall under the sub-category cs.COMM (Computer Communication Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
