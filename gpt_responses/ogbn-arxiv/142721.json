The focus on Byzantine fault tolerance suggests a potential fit for the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category. The proposed modifications to decrease message complexity involve graph topologies, which could fall under the graph theory (cs.DS) category. Finally, the safety and liveness properties of the protocols relate to system and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
