The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and language models, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of latent representations, which is a common topic in the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing).
