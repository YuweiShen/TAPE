The paper also mentions the use of motion capture systems, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of cubic splines for interpolation, which is a common technique in graphics (cs.GR). The paper presents an algorithm for selecting relevant points in a trajectory, which involves decision-making and optimization, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
