The paper also discusses the use of branch-and-bound and gradient-ascent methods, which are common optimization techniques in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with the complexity of the problem, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
