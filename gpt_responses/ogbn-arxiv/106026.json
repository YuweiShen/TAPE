Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves optimization and graph algorithms, which could fall under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The study of optimal graphs and their properties could also be categorized under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper discusses applications of the results to graph drawing, which could be classified under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
