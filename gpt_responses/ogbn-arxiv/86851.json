The paper also involves reductions from and connections to other well-known problems in computer science, such as SETH and $\\ell_2$-Furthest Pair, which suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely categories. The paper also involves analysis of approximation algorithms and their optimality, which suggests that cs.IT (Information Theory) may be a relevant category.
