The use of feedback links and antenna selection are common topics in information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of space-time coding and compares it to the proposed antenna selection strategy, which falls under the category of system and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multiple antennas, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
