The paper also proposes a classification algorithm based on statistical separability, which falls under the Statistical Learning (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also deals with precoding methods, which are studied in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, which are studied in the Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-category, but this is less likely given the focus on feedback mechanisms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
