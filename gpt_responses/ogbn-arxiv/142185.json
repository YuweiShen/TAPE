It is also likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as scene flow estimation is an important component of many autonomous driving systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of synthetic data for training and verification, which is a common topic in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves generating synthetic data with precise ground truth."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
