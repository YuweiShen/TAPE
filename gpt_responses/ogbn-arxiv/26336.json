This topic falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of these networks for classification tasks (cs.CV) and their potential for in-memory computing (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also discusses the self-normalizing property of the networks, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
