The paper also discusses the efficiency of repairing lost redundancy, which is a problem related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper proposes a new family of codes that allows different trade-offs, which is a topic related to optimization and decision making (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents an explicit construction of locally repairable codes, which involves mathematical structures such as partial geometries and Generalized Quadrangles, making it relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
