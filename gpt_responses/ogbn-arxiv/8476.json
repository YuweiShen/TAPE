The use of state-of-the-art RL approaches also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on generalizing from short proofs to longer ones suggests a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the use of curriculum learning suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE) as it is a common approach for designing educational materials."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
