It proposes the idea of an IoTScanner that can detect and classify privacy threats in IoT neighborhoods. This work involves aspects of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with privacy threats, networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it involves wireless connectivity, and systems and control (cs.SY) as it proposes a solution to manage and control wireless communication. Additionally, the paper involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses heuristics to classify devices, and software engineering (cs.SE) as it proposes a new tool for technical support and home users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
