The probabilistic object detection method also involves information theory concepts such as probability and estimation. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Visible light communication systems are a type of indoor access and peer-to-peer network, which falls under the scope of this sub-category. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes a method for object detection and parameter estimation, which is a core topic in computer vision. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The quadratic programming approach used for object parameter estimation can be considered a machine learning technique. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for cooperative object detection, which involves controlling the communication between user devices and transceivers on the ceiling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
