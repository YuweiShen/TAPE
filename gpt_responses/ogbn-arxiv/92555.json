The approach involves dividing the area of interest into smaller domains, selecting the best source domains using a similarity measurement, and adapting an existing transfer learning approach. This work involves machine learning (ML) techniques and signal processing, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves the use of AI techniques for position recovery, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper proposes a framework for Telco position recovery, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
