Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel method based on finite state transducers, which is a common tool in machine learning and natural language processing, making the paper relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the customization of the transducer based on different disambiguation policies, which is a software engineering concern, making the paper relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
