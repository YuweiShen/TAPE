The paper also proposes a learning algorithm to solve the problem, which involves optimization and control (cs.IT, cs.SY). The use of Markov decision process (MDP) and stochastic approximation also suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
