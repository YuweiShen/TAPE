The paper discusses the behavior of mirror descent (MD) in non-monotone problems, which is a common technique in optimization and machine learning. The paper also introduces optimistic mirror descent (OMD) as a modification of MD that improves convergence in these problems. Given this focus on optimization in machine learning, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) due to the focus on optimization and machine learning, as well as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) due to the application of these techniques to GANs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
