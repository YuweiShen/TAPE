The paper does not focus on a specific area of computer science, but rather on a methodology used in various fields. However, the paper does mention the importance of studies at the level of countries and research organizations, which suggests that it may be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, the paper discusses the handling of publications with multiple co-authors, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
