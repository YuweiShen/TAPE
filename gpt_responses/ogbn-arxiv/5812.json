The proposed UH-BigDataSys aims to improve the health of urban residents, which is a societal goal. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method of integrating multi-source air quality data for the data preparation of artificial-intelligence-based smart urban services. The proposed UH-BigDataSys also utilizes AI techniques for health guidance. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the collection and integration of various sources of air quality data, which involves information retrieval techniques. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of crowdsourcing and IoT sensing for collecting air quality data, which involves social and information networks. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system, UH-BigDataSys, for urban healthcare based on crowdsourced and cloud-based air quality indicators. The system involves control and management of various components, such as data collection, integration, and health guidance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
