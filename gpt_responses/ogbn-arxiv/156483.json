Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the construction of frameworks for solving problems related to graph theory (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG) in some of the frameworks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
