The method is based on a variant of recurrent neural network prediction and provides gradient-based strategies for optimizing over model parameters to minimize the loss function. This falls under the scope of machine learning, specifically in the area of classification.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on labeling nodes in network data, which is a key problem in social and information networks. The proposed method is designed to incorporate relational information into classification, which is a common approach in this field.\n- cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper's focus on network data and collective classification is relevant to computational social science, which often involves analyzing social networks and their properties.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's proposed method for training iterative collective classifiers falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, specifically in the area of machine learning.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper's proposed method involves optimizing over model parameters to minimize the loss function, which is a common problem in data structures and algorithms.
