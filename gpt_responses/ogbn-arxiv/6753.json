Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The approach involves using stacked approximations, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and the optimization of hyperparameters (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
