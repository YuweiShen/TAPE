This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new network architecture that combines specialized convolution and pooling layers, which involves learning which edges to collapse, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves the use of neural networks for learning tasks, which makes it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
