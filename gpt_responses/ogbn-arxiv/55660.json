The paper proposes a method for constructing a local graph structured knowledge base for each query, which compresses the web search information and reduces redundancy. This method can be applied to various NLP tasks, such as long-form question answering and multi-document summarization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, such as TF-IDF ranking, to extract relevant information from web results. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe proposed method involves constructing a knowledge graph, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves linearizing the graph into a structured input sequence, which is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the proposed method involves constructing a local graph structured knowledge base, which can be seen as a form of database. Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
