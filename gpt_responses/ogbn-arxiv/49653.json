The paper proposes a novel feature-encoding approach using a Mask Weight Network (MWN), which involves learning masks and applying channel-wise masking operations to ROI feature maps. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions using global contextual information to improve object-detection accuracy, which could relate to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
