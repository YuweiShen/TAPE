The paper also proposes a construction of optimal streaming codes, which involves coding theory (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper considers a specific channel loss model and characterizes the maximum achievable rate, which is a problem in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
