The use of deep learning models for keypoint detection and matching also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the incorporation of global geometric constraints in the loss function indicates that the paper could also be relevant to computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
