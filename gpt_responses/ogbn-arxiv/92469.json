It also involves theoretical analysis of the proposed method. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the experiments are conducted on image datasets and the proposed method aims to improve the model's ability to handle corruptions in real-world images. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with the robustness of deep neural networks, which is a fundamental problem in AI. \n\ncs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with adversarial examples, which are intentionally designed inputs to mislead neural networks, and proposes a defense strategy against them. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a new training method for neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
