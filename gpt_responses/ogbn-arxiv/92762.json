Therefore, the most likely category is cs.EM (Electromagnetics). Additionally, the paper also discusses the transmission efficiency and distance, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The design of multiple transmitters/receivers is related to robotics (cs.RO) and electrical engineering (cs.EE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
