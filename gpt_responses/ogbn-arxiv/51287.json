This topic falls under several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Computational Geometry (cs.CG), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), and Graph Theory (cs.GT). The paper's focus on independent sets, vertex covers, and feedback vertex sets also suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-categories of Combinatorics (math.CO) and Optimization and Control (math.OC). However, given the algorithmic nature of the paper and the prominence of minimal separators in the analysis, we believe that cs.DM, cs.DS, cs.CG, cs.CC, and cs.GT are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
