This involves designing a web accessible API and handling non-determinism. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.PL (Programming Languages) as they are directly related to logic programming and Prolog. The paper also mentions the use of a deductive database, which falls under cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper discusses the design of a web interface, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves designing an API for data retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
