Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses various deep learning models and training strategies, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and evaluation metrics (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
