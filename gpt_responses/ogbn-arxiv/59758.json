The use of feedback and noise in the channel also suggests a possible connection to networked information systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the impact of feedback on the transmission of signals, which could be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
