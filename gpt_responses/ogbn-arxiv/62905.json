This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of parameterized functions and an inductive search framework, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper also involves simulations and experiments with real physical systems, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the design of controllers with formal correctness guarantees, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
