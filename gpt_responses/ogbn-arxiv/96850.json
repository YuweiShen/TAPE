The use of state space expressions and homomorphism theorem suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of discrete structures (cs.DS). The evaluation of complexity and the use of matrix theory suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the use of algebraic constructions and the mention of a previous method proposed by McEliece suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
