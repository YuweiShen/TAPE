This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of symbolic models (cs.AI) and the incorporation of prior knowledge (cs.SY) in the model discovery process. Finally, the application of the method is in computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
