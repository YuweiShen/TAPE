The paper also discusses the difficulty of computing in these networks, which involves the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of language theory and automata theory to analyze the expressivity of time-varying graphs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on the power of waiting in dynamic networks suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
