Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the reduction of traffic in caching networks, which falls under the scope of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of combinatorial structures and linear block codes suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper proposes new schemes for coded caching, which falls under the scope of cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
