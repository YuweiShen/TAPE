It also discusses the limitations of the TCP family of protocols, which is a topic of interest in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new congestion control architecture that involves continuous observation and empirical analysis, which could also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the performance and stability of the proposed architecture, which could be relevant to performance evaluation and optimization (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
