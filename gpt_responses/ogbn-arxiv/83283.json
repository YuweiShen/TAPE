Additionally, the paper explores a new parameterization of the approximate posterior that improves performance. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks and learning (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories due to its focus on deep Bayesian neural networks and stochastic gradient estimates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
