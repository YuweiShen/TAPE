The paper also mentions the use of TLA+ and TLAPS, which are tools for formal verification and proof development, respectively, and are commonly used in the subfields of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the reduction in the number of invariants and obligations needed for proofs, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with the correctness of distributed algorithms, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
