This involves regularization techniques from nearly-isotonic regression, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses algorithms for solving MDPs, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes an optimization scheme for solving MDPs, which involves linear programming and regularization techniques. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses Markov decision processes, which are commonly used in control theory and decision-making systems. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): Markov decision processes are commonly used in multi-agent systems, and the paper proposes an optimization scheme for computing monotone policies in such systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
