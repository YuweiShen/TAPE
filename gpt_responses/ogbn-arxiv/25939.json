This involves continuously growing and pruning important and secondary learning units, respectively, to generate a sparse inference model. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers on the development of algorithms and models for machine learning, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers on the study and development of neural networks and their applications, which is relevant to the proposed training scheme. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers on computer vision and image processing, which are common applications of deep neural networks. The paper uses popular DNN structures on representative datasets, which are likely to include computer vision tasks. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks. The paper's focus on efficient network construction is relevant to the broader goal of AI. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers papers on the design and analysis of systems and control, which may include hardware platforms for deep neural networks. The paper benchmarks the proposed training scheme on FPGA, which is a hardware platform for"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
