Additionally, the paper proposes a method to add source context to a Transformer model, which is a popular neural network architecture used in NLP tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper mentions the use of document-level translation tasks, which could potentially place it in the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) as document analysis and understanding is a common task in computer vision.
