The use of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model also suggests a focus on simulation and modeling (cs.SI). The study of how excitability controls the propagation of excitation and determines patterns of traversing a random planar graph falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The numerical analysis and exploration of patterns also suggest a focus on mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
