The use of hierarchical recurrent neural networks (HRNNs) is also mentioned, which is a technique that has been applied in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT), which is a common optimization algorithm used in neural networks, and is relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
