The paper also discusses the use of containers and sandboxing, which are common techniques in distributed computing. \n\nThe Programming Languages (cs.PL) category is also likely because the paper proposes a new approach to optimizing serverless functions using a language-based sandboxing technique. The paper also mentions the use of Rust, which is a programming language known for its safety and performance features. \n\nThe Software Engineering (cs.SE) category is another possibility because the paper discusses the challenges of optimizing serverless functions and proposes a new tool (Containerless) to address these challenges. The paper also evaluates the performance of Containerless using benchmarks, which is a common practice in software engineering research. \n\nThe Architecture (cs.AR) category is a less likely possibility, but still plausible because the paper discusses the design and implementation of a new system (Containerless) for optimizing serverless functions. The paper also mentions the use of containers and sandboxing, which are architectural concepts. \n\nThe Systems and Control (cs.SY) category is also a less likely possibility, but still possible because the paper discusses the use of tracing and compilation techniques to optimize serverless functions, which are common techniques in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
