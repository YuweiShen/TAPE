The paper also discusses the impact of loop interference suppression, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). The use of finite blocklength codes for short-packet communications is a topic related to communication theory (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper mentions the potential applications of the proposed techniques in multimedia communications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
