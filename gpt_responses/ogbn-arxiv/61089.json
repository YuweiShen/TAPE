The paper also surveys different models of decidability, which could be considered as a topic in logic and computation (cs.LO). The Russian school and hypercomputation are mentioned, which are both topics in theoretical computer science (cs.SC) that deal with models of computation beyond the Turing machine. Finally, the paper discusses the computability of the Mandelbrot set over the rationals, which could be considered as a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
