The paper proposes a generalized Kelly mechanism (GKM) for resource allocation, which is a mechanism design problem and falls under game theory (cs.GT). The paper also uses optimization techniques such as Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) conditions for solving the resource allocation problem, which is a subfield of information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents simulation results for verifying the proposed theoretical analysis, which involves multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
