The paper also discusses the issue of reconstruction distortion, which is a topic of interest in cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also introduces a new bounding technique, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
