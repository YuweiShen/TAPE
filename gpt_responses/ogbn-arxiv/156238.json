The talk also mentions exploiting structural properties of robotic domains, which involves artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). Additionally, the talk discusses perceptual problems, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV). The mention of challenges and tricks necessary to make the techniques work suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY), and the use of particle filters involves probabilistic modeling and inference (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
