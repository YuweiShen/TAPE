The paper specifically focuses on the multiclass setting and uses deep learning techniques to train end-to-end models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper applies the proposed method to an image classification benchmark, indicating relevance to the sub-categories cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses nonlinear models, which suggests relevance to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
