This involves designing an optimal auction mechanism, which is a classic problem in game theory. \n- cs.CY (Computational Geometry): The paper mentions a non-convex optimization problem that needs to be solved to find the parameters of the optimal auction mechanism. This could potentially involve computational geometry techniques. \n- cs.CE (Computational Economics and Finance): The paper deals with optimizing revenue in online ad auctions, which is a topic of interest in computational economics and finance. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions that discriminatory ads can cross ethical and legal boundaries, which could be a concern for security and privacy. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with online advertising platforms and the distribution of ads across different user types, which is a topic of interest in social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
