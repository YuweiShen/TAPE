This involves integrating two kinds of nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) priors of noisy and pre-filtered images through the mechanism of sparsity residual. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. However, the paper also involves designing an adaptive patch search scheme and an effective iterative shrinkage algorithm, which are related to information theory (cs.IT), multimedia (cs.MM), machine learning (cs.LG), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
