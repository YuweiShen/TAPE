This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses reinforcement learning for architecture search, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses strategies for efficient search within limited time and computational budgets, which could fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
