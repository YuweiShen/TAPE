The authors propose a system that uses machine learning techniques to automatically learn hash functions, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also uses a hierarchical tree structure, which is a common data structure in computer science and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the system aims to optimize recall and efficiency, which is a common problem in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
