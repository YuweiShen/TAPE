This falls under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SD) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the evaluation metrics used in the experiments include speech intelligibility, which is a sub-topic of speech processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
