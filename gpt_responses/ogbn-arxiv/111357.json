The use of restricted isometry property (RIP) and restricted orthogonality constant (ROC) also suggests a possible connection to Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the focus on a specific algorithm (Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) may indicate a potential fit with the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
