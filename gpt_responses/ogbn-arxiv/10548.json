Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also includes experiments on cart-pole balancing and acrobot swing-up problems, which are related to robotics, making cs.RO (Robotics) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the convergence and limit of RLS-TD(\u03bb) for ergodic Markov chains, which is related to neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
