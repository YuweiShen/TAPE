The paper also proposes a (semi-)formal approach for specifying and reasoning about data protection policies and architectures, which involves software engineering principles (cs.SE) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper focuses on privacy and data protection regulations, which are related to cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper proposes a framework for mathematically sound conformance checks, which involves programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
