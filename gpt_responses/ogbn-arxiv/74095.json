The use of self-supervised learning also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper involves the development of a novel loss function, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The fact that the approach is designed to work with monocular images captured with a moving camera suggests that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the use of Monte Carlo-based training strategy and the focus on object proposals could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
