This involves converting discrete representations of molecules to a continuous representation, which can then be manipulated to generate new structures. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), computational chemistry (cs.CE), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of image-based techniques (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) in related work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
