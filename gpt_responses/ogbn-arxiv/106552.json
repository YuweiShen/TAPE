The paper also discusses the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The success of pruning based model compression methods is also mentioned, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the application of semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
