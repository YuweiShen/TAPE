This falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also discusses the potential of CNN-based methods for plant species detection, which can be considered as an Information Retrieval (cs.IR) problem. The use of CNNs for land cover mapping also involves Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with the detection of scattered shrubs, which can be considered as a Geometric Reasoning (cs.GR) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
