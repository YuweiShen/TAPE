These topics are typically studied in the subfield of computational complexity theory, which falls under cs.CC. The paper also involves the study of sparse polynomials, which is a topic of interest in computational geometry (cs.CG) and algebraic geometry (cs.AG). The mention of deterministic algorithms suggests a connection to computational algorithms (cs.DS), and the mention of lower bounds suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.SC) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
