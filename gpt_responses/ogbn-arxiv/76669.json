This is a topic that falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams, which involves some level of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on the Cityscapes benchmark, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) to some extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
