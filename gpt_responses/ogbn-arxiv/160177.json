The use of L_1 regularization and sparsity patterns also suggests a focus on sparse modeling and feature selection. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also involves convex optimization, which is relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
