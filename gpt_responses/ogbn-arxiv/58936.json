The proposed solution is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a popular machine learning technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the problem of detecting image duplication in scientific publications, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a data-driven solution, which involves training a CNN, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
