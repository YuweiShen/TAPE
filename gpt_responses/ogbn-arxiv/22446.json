The paper proposes a new method that uses the Area Under the Margin (AUM) statistic to identify mislabeled data. This involves adding an extra class populated with purposefully mislabeled indicator samples, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning. The paper evaluates the proposed method on synthetic and real-world datasets, including the WebVision50 classification task and CIFAR100. Given the focus on machine learning and neural networks, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
