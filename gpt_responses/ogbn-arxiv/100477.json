The paper also discusses optimization-based approaches for automatic design of these patches, which could be considered under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with the security aspect of face detection, which could be categorized under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category.
