Additionally, it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as NMT is a subfield of AI and machine learning. Furthermore, it may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as NMT uses neural networks for translation. Lastly, it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper introduces a technique for visualizing the divergence distribution caused by a source-side error."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
