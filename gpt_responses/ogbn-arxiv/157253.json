The system combines energy models and hardware-based measurements, which involves system-level programming (cs.SY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper also discusses the need for continuous data to build energy models, which relates to data-centric computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
