It also involves the development of an intermediate representation (IR) that enables both deep learning computational kernels and hardware capabilities to be described in the same IR. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories as it deals with deep learning computational kernels and their optimization for hardware systems. \n\nThe cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper involves the development of a flexible framework for managing the large search space of mappings and schedules. \n\nFinally, the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category is a possibility as the paper involves the development of a compiler for deep learning that is compute and hardware agnostic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
