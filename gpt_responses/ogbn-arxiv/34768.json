The construction of irreducible polynomials and nonresidues involves algebraic techniques, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions a conjecture related to the Generalized Riemann hypothesis, which is a topic in number theory and could be relevant to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
