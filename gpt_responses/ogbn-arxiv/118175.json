The concept of outerplanar graphs is also relevant to graph theory (cs.DM) and the paper provides results on the edge-length ratio of such graphs, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the combinatorial embedding of outerplanar graphs, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The results on edge-length ratio can be seen as a form of graph optimization, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of the results, which can be seen as a form of algorithmic analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
