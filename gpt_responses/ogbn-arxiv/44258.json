The use of LSTM networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed feature fusion strategy and the integration of multi-scale contextual information could also place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the proposed method in robotics and the use of depth cameras could also make it relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of RGB-D cameras and the focus on human detection could also make it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
