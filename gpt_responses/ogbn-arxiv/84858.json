Information theory is closely related to signal processing, and hence this category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not deal with social networks, but it does deal with information networks in the form of spike trains. Hence, this category is also a likely fit.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for recovering spike trains from Fourier transform measurements, which involves the use of convex optimization. This is a common technique in machine learning, and hence this category is also a possible fit.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with the problem of recovering spike trains, which is a problem in neuroscience. Hence, this category is also a possible fit.\n5. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the problem of recovering spike trains from Fourier transform measurements, which is a problem in signal processing.
