The paper also proposes a technique for reducing selection pressure on recently morphologically-changed individuals, which involves optimizing the control policy of the robot (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the morphology and control of the robot, which is a common technique in the field of neural evolution (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for this technique to enable the automation of robot design and behavioral training, which is a topic in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
