The paper introduces a new method called Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP) and a localized version called Single-pass Belief Propagation (SBP) for this purpose. These methods are likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including social network analysis (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
