It also discusses the properties of these codes, such as diversity and coding gain, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). The paper presents a new scheme for constructing these codes, which involves optimization and algorithm design, making it relevant to computer science theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper includes simulation results for symbol error rates, which involves performance evaluation and measurement, making it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
