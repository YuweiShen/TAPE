The paper also mentions the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), indicating a potential connection to computer communications (cs.CC). The evaluation of upper bounds on minimum distance may involve simulations or experiments, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI) or distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS). Finally, the use of LDPC codes in deep space communications may also suggest a connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
