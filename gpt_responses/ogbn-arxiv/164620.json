The paper focuses on the evaluation of omnidirectional images, which are commonly used in virtual reality applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves human perception and subjective experiments, which suggest the possibility of belonging to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper uses deep learning techniques, which could also suggest cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves graphics and multimedia, which could suggest cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
