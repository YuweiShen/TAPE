This involves predicting 2D facial point heat maps and exploiting recurrent learning at both spatial and temporal dimensions. The paper also discusses feature disentangling and its impact on generalization and accuracy. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
