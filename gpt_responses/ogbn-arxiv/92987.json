Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the Quality of Experience (QoE) of clients, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper formulates the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), which is a type of optimization problem and falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of index-based policies, which is a type of algorithmic learning and falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a decentralized streaming algorithm, which involves decision-making and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
