The proposed method involves modifying the stego image to reduce the residual distance between cover and stego, which requires knowledge of image processing and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of integer programming and heuristic search, which are topics in mathematical optimization and machine learning (cs.MM, cs.IT). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using both hand-crafted steganalytic features and deep learning based ones, which suggests a focus on machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
