This involves approximating the black-box functionality with a differentiable neural network and driving the base network to comply with the black-box function interface during the end-to-end optimization process. The paper also discusses the advantages of this method over RL-based methods. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
