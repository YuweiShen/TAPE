The system uses a visual front-end, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also evaluates the precision of the system, which involves machine learning and statistical analysis (cs.LG). The system is designed to be robust, which involves artificial intelligence and optimization techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the system can be applied to various robotic systems, which involves control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
