The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it conducts experiments on image classification benchmarks. Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a method for training efficient predictive models. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it mentions hyperprior learners, which are commonly used in Bayesian models for language modeling. Finally, the paper involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it proposes a method for training epoch-wise models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
