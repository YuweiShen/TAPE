This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a new scheme for serving users in IoT, which involves multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new scheme for serving users in IoT, which involves designing precoding and detection strategies to create a significant difference between users' effective channel gains. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, but the proposed scheme involves optimizing the precoding and detection strategies to improve the performance of the system, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not deal with multimedia specifically, but the proposed scheme could potentially be used for small packet transmission of multimedia data in IoT applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
