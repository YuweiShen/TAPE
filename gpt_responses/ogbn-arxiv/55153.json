Additionally, the paper proposes a new pruning technique and quantization scheme to reduce the computational complexity and memory usage of convolutional layers, which are common techniques used in machine learning and deep learning, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper also proposes an efficient hardware architecture to accelerate CNN operations, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
