The paper also discusses the relationship between different type systems and the typed processes they induce, which is a topic related to logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper introduces a new expressiveness hierarchy for typed concurrent processes based on the degree of sharing between parallel processes, which is a topic related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
