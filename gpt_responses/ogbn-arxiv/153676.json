The paper also mentions the use of mathematical tools to remove limitations in previous proofs, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The discussion of multi-path wireless communication systems and MIMO systems suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper touches on stochastic operators, which could relate to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
