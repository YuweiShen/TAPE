CBIR is a subfield of computer vision, and the use of deep autoencoders for feature learning is a common technique in computer vision research.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with image retrieval, which is a subfield of information retrieval. The use of binary codes for image retrieval is also a common technique in information retrieval research.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep autoencoders for feature learning and binary code construction, which are common techniques in machine learning research.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with medical images, which are a type of multimedia data. The use of deep autoencoders for feature learning and binary code construction for image retrieval is also relevant to multimedia research.\n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses deep autoencoders, which are a type of neural network, for feature learning and binary code construction. This is relevant to research in neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
