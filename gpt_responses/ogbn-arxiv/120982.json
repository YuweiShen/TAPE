This suggests that the paper belongs to the Robotics category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision) - The paper proposes a vision model that conditions its feature representations on embedded representations of the agent's goal. This suggests that the paper also belongs to the Computer Vision category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses imitation learning to train the proposed model, which is a common technique in AI. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to building scene descriptions that are goal-directed, which is a relevant topic in AI.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a new approach to building vision models that are more parameter efficient and robust than existing attention mechanisms. This suggests that the paper belongs to the Machine Learning category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper focuses on a robotic problem and proposes a vision model that is designed to help achieve a specific goal. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
