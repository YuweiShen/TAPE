This involves robotics (cs.RO) as well as human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and computer vision (cs.CV) for the AR modalities. The improved planner mentioned in the abstract also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the safety-critical aspect of the project suggests the involvement of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
