The proposed evaluation metric involves the use of brain signals, which suggests a connection to neural engineering (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a common tool in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of reflecting human perception of image quality, which suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
