This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of self-paced learning and augmentation of training samples also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of Computed Tomography (CT) images suggests a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the need for annotation and labeling of medical images suggests a potential fit for the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
