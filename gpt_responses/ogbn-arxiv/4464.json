The paper also discusses the relationship between radial cones and certain faces of polyhedra, which is a topic relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses techniques from linear programming and polyhedral combinatorics, which are areas of research in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
