The use of transform coding and clustering also suggests a potential fit with multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the compression of data over limited or expensive channels may also relate to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
