The paper also discusses the use of linear logic, which is a subfield of logic. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a mechanism for adding interaction to logic programming, which is a subfield of AI. The paper also discusses the use of expressive logics, which are relevant to AI. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes an extension of Prolog, which is a programming language. The paper also discusses the use of game semantics, which is a subfield of programming languages. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not explicitly discuss computational complexity, but the proposed mechanism for adding interaction to logic programming may have implications for the complexity of programs. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new mechanism for adding interaction to logic programming, which may be relevant to software engineering. The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed mechanism in muprolog, which is a software system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
