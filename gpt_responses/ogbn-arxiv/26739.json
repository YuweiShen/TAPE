The use of weighted sequences and profiles connects the paper to computational biology, but the focus is on the algorithmic aspects. The paper proposes parameterized algorithms for these problems, which suggests a connection to parameterized complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The use of geometric and probabilistic arguments in the paper suggests a possible connection to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are also relevant sub-categories for this work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
