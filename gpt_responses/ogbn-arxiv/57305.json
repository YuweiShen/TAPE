The motivation for the study of these codes comes from applications in DNA-based storage systems and synchronization protocols, which suggests that the paper could also be classified under data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the requirement for the codes to have balanced compositions of symbols and to be at large mutual Hamming distance from each other, which are concepts related to cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
