The use of language to guide perception involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which are part of the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel extension of symbolic representations for language-guided perception, which involves reasoning and inference, falling under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The perception pipeline involves object detection, which is a computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper explores the differences in performance between adaptive perception and a suitable baseline, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
