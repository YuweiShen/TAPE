This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category, as it deals with the interaction between users and the tool. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sketches for understanding, designing, and communicating software systems, which aligns with the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also mentions the capture and organization of context information, which could fall under the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category. The use of augmented analog versions of sketches suggests a possible connection to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category, as it involves the retrieval and presentation of relevant information. Finally, the paper's focus on integrating analog and digital workflows could relate to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category, as it involves the coordination and communication between different types of media."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
