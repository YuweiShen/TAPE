The focus of the paper is on the standardization activities within the 3GPP related to enhanced intercell interference coordination. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
