The paper proposes a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm that is applicable to both non-sparse and sparse mmWave channel environments. The paper also discusses the use of zero-forcing (ZF) precoding for multiuser downlink transmission. These topics are closely related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), control and systems engineering (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
