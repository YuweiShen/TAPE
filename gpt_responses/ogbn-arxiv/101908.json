It also mentions the application of constraint programming to planning and scheduling (cs.PL) and the need for dynamic additions of new variables and constraints, which relates to data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of global constraints, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
