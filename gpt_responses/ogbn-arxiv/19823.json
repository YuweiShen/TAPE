Specifically, the paper focuses on the mean field limit of these networks, which is a concept that is closely related to the study of large-scale neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper also introduces a new concept called neuronal embedding, which could potentially be of interest to researchers in the fields of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
