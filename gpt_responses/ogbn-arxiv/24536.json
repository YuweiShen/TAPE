The paper also mentions the use of instance level constraints, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) where instances are often used. Additionally, the paper mentions triplet constraints, which is a common technique in similarity learning (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
