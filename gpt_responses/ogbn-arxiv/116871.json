However, the main focus of the paper is on channel estimation using power domain measurements, which is a problem that is typically studied in the context of information theory (cs.IT). Moreover, the proposed technique involves coordination among multiple transmitters, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-fields of networking (cs.NI) and systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of optimization algorithms to improve network performance, which could place it in the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.MM) or learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
