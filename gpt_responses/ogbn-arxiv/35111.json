The proposed approach utilizes Linked Open Data (LOD) resources, which are commonly used in semantic web (cs.SI) and knowledge representation (cs.AI). The approach also involves entity linking, which is a technique used in information extraction (cs.IR, cs.CL) and natural language understanding (cs.AI). The co-occurrence graphs used in the approach can be seen as a form of network analysis (cs.SI, cs.SD), while the ontology introduced for representing topics can be seen as a form of database modeling (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
