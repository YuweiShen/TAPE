Additionally, the paper introduces a new computational layer that enhances the network's ability to learn structural information, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the layer's ability to improve robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, which are topics commonly studied in the neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
