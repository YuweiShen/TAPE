The proposed solution involves non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cooperation among base stations (BSs), which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses power allocation and optimization, which are relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper addresses communication protocols and techniques, which fall under computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
