Additionally, the paper discusses the use of rewrite rules to define arithmetic operations on natural numbers and integers, which could be considered a topic in programming languages (cs.PL) or data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of canonical term algebras, which is a concept in formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the DDRSes and their ground-completeness, which could be considered a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
