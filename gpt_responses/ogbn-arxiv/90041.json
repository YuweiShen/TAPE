The method involves generating transition dynamics templates, which relates to robotics and control (cs.RO) and system identification (cs.SY). The paper also discusses sample efficiency, which is a common concern in machine learning and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
