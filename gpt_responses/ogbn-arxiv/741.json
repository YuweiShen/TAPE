This involves the use of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, which are commonly used in the fields of human-computer interaction (cs.HC), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of multimodal data suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
