This vulnerability can be exploited using a cache called page frame cache. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also talks about the physical memory allocation subsystem, which falls under the category of cs.OS (Operating Systems). The possibility of conducting a Rowhammer attack using user-level privilege suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.AR (Architecture), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
