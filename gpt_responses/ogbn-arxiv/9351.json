The use of automata and formal semantics also suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and formal languages (cs.FL). The focus on reactive systems and their behavior suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE), while the use of algorithms and computational models suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
