The paper also specifically mentions structured representations such as graphs, frames, and logical clauses, which are commonly used in areas such as natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of ad-hoc functions for specific applications, which is a common issue in machine learning and could be relevant to the cs.LG sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
