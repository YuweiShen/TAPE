The use of SHAP for generating explanations is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the legal requirement for explainability, which falls under the category of computer ethics (cs.CE). The use of counterfactual explanations involves manipulating data, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses datasets to test the proposed method, which falls under the category of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
