This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper focuses on on-chip memories, or Block RAMs (BRAMs), which are a key component of embedded systems. The evaluation of the built-in ECC for mitigating undervolting faults is also relevant to embedded systems.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of FPGAs for neural network acceleration, which is a common application in distributed and parallel computing.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the impact of undervolting on the timing of digital circuits, which is relevant to systems and control.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper evaluates an FPGA-based neural network accelerator, which falls under the domain of neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
