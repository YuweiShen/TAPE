This suggests that the paper could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Information Theory (cs.IT), Graphics (cs.GR), or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. However, since the focus is on image compression and reconstruction, cs.MM and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The use of optimization techniques and standard compression methods also suggests cs.IT and cs.NI as possible sub-categories. Finally, the modeling of displays as blur degradations could also make cs.GR a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
