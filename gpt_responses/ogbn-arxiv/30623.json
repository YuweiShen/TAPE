The use of regular (tree) automata as certificates suggests a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The paper also involves the analysis of data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering techniques (cs.SE) for proving non-termination. Finally, the use of term rewriting systems suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
