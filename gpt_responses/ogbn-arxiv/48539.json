The proposed method of symmetric padding and even-sized kernels also involves architectural design, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) datasets for evaluation, indicating a potential connection to that sub-category. Finally, the mention of training efforts and efficiency suggests a possible connection to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
