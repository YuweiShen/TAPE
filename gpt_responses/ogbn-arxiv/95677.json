The use of computer vision also suggests the involvement of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV). The proposed algorithm involves optimization techniques, which can be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of parallel computing suggests the involvement of control systems and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
