Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The method involves learning a set of coefficients to linearly combine base filters, which is a technique related to artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NE). Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on image datasets, which is a topic related to multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
