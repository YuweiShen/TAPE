This falls under the category of computer networks and communication (cs.NI). The paper also involves experimental evaluation and analysis, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY) or cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed solution in the Linux kernel, which could fall under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
