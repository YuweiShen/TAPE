The presence of a hybrid adversary and the analysis of achievable rates involve network security (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of different methods for obtaining transmitter CSI, which could involve machine learning (cs.MM) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
