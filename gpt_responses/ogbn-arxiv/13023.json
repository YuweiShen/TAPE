The paper proposes a novel method to compute the learning rate for training deep neural networks with stochastic gradient descent, which is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the extension of the proposed method to other commonly used optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent with momentum and Adam, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
