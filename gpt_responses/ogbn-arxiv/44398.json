The specific focus on image classifiers suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a likely sub-category. The use of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning also suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as relevant sub-categories. Finally, the use of metamorphic testing, which is a technique for testing systems with unknown oracles, suggests systems and control (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
