The paper proposes a new online learning algorithm for structured contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with high-dimensional arm and context sets. This work is highly relevant to the field of machine learning, specifically in the areas of reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
