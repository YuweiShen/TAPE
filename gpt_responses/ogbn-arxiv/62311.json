Specifically, the paper proposes an incremental learning approach for metric-based meta-learners, which involves updating the meta-learner in an incremental fashion when additional training data becomes available. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely categories, as they are the most closely related to the topic of meta-learning for few-shot classification tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
