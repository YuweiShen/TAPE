This involves modeling motion using a newly proposed component, motion guider, which learns temporal features from real data and guides the generator to predict future frames. The spatial consistency in video is modeled by an adaptive filtering network. The paper also uses a discriminator to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and to leak information to the motion guider and generator to help the learning of motion. Given these details, the paper is most likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, followed by Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) are also possible sub-categories given the focus on video prediction and the use of a discriminator."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
