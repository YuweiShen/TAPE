This involves the use of anomaly detection and supervised classification frameworks to predict whether two topics are competing conventions and should merge, as well as predicting the winning topic. The paper also discusses the ability of the system to predict correct merges within a certain time frame and compares its performance to human judgment. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
