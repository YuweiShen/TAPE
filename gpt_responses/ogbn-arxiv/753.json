It also involves learning compact representations of facial templates, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using occlusion masks, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper discusses face verification, which is a security-related problem and could be classified under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
