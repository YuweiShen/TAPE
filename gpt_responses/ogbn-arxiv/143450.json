The use of inverted index is also a common technique in these fields. The paper also mentions the use of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and priority queues (PQ), which are common data structures in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also demonstrates similarity search on different data types, including images (cs.CV), and uses theoretical analysis and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
