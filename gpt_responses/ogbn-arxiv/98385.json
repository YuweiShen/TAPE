The use of artificial noise to deceive an adversary falls under the category of physical layer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the impact of the path-loss exponent on the covert throughput, which is a topic in wireless communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a strategy for friendly nodes to generate artificial noise, which involves coordination and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
