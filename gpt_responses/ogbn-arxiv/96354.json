The most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), as the paper explicitly mentions entropy, mutual information, divergence, and association measures. The paper also mentions the use of information theoretical optimization problems, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The prototype application in independent subspace analysis and its extensions could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
