The proposed solution leverages the ability of hybrid analog-digital transceivers to collect channel information from multiple spatial directions simultaneously and formulates a probabilistic optimization problem to model the temporal evolution of the mm-wave channel under mobility. This suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which are the most relevant sub-categories for research on wireless communication systems. Moreover, the paper also presents a beam tracking algorithm that extracts information needed to update the steering directions directly from data packets, without the need for spatial scanning during the ongoing data transmission. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data over wireless networks. Finally, the paper proposes a smart beam training and tracking strategy that improves the performance of mm-wave systems, which suggests that it could also be classified under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), which deal with the design and optimization of complex systems and hardware architectures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
