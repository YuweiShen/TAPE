The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The authors use techniques from algebraic topology and combinatorics, which are areas of research in computer science that often intersect with graph theory (cs.DS) and geometric topology (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
