The proposed method involves the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for disentangling facial expression representation from identity information, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are performed on publicly available face expression databases, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
