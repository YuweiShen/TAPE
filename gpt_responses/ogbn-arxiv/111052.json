Therefore, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a multi-modal emotion recognition model based on deep learning techniques using facial expressions and physiological signals, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of deep learning techniques for emotion recognition also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
