The paper proposes a new algorithm for generating constrained adversarial examples, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the physical constraints of cyber-physical systems, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a new threat model for adversarial machine learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
