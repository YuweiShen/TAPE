This topic falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The algorithm involves photometric and geometric error for pose tracking, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses a model of multi-view constraints, which is related to computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
