This involves designing a sequential questioning strategy based on previous questions and answers, subject to a budget constraint. This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves designing a decision-making framework. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of heuristics and simulations, which are common in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, which is commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
