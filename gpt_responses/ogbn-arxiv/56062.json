Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for training deep continuous CRFs with task-specific loss functions, which involves optimizing the quality of the MAP estimates during the learning process. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on multi-class semantic labeling and robust depth estimation tasks, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
