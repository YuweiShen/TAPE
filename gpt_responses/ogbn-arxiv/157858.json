This involves the use of a model predictive controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption of a consumer and that seen by the grid. The paper also discusses non-intrusive load monitoring techniques and their potential privacy risks. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
