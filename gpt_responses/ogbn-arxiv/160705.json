The use of neural networks to find a basis for the function space of orthogonal representations suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The applications of the framework to multi-view representation learning (cs.CV) and exploratory statistical techniques (cs.ST) further support these categories. Additionally, the mention of comparing black-box models suggests a potential connection to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
