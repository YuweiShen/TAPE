The use of body landmarks as input to the network and the auxiliary task of reconstructing input heatmaps suggest that the paper may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of synthetic datasets and the evaluation of the method on real datasets suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the application of the method to animal re-identification suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
