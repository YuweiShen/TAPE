Specifically, it uses Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNN) to learn normal behavior and detect deviations from it. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests a potential fit for the sub-categories of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
