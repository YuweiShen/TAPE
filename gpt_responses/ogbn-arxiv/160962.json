The behaviour of the plasmodium is mediated by environmental stimuli, which relates to systems and control (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also explores potential morphological computation approaches, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
