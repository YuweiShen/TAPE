Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new feedforward layer to improve the nonlinear transformation power, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the semantic and syntactic information of dimensions in the hidden states, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The proposed method is evaluated with three different tasks, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) depending on the nature of the tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
