The paper also proposes methods for detecting adversarial images, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of principal component analysis (PCA) in the detection method suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
