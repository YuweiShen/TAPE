The paper also discusses the use of sparse coding (cs.LG) and multivariate ridge regression (cs.MM) for learning local projection models. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of information theory (cs.IT) for selecting the best sparse coding parameters. Finally, the paper uses neural networks (cs.NE) for face recognition and compares the performance of different methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
