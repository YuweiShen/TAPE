This involves analyzing the expert's reward and the market scoring rule, which are key concepts in game theory.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal policy for the expert. This algorithmic approach is commonly used in AI research.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with the problem of learning when to reveal information in a prediction market, which is a common problem in machine learning and decision making.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the optimization problem, which is a core topic in data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper analyzes the expert's asymptotic expected optimal reward and shows a tight connection to the Law of the Iterated Logarithm, which is a fundamental result in information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
