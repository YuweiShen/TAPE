These tasks are commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. The paper also introduces a novel network design, which can be considered a contribution to machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the proposed network can be applied to robotics (cs.RO) and computer graphics (cs.CR) domains, as scene understanding is important for both fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
