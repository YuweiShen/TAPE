The use of the Stochastic Block Model and edge sub-sampling suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of social networks (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The evaluation of a percolation based deanonymization algorithm and the consideration of real world datasets suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of security and privacy (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
