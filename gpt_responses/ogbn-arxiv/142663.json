The use of reinforcement learning to optimise for a reward that is less tightly coupled to the training data is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of quality metrics, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and information retrieval (cs.IR).
