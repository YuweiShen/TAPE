The paper also proposes an approach based on semantic models, which involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI) and software engineering principles (cs.SE). The use of SDN controllers is also mentioned, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper aims to make IoT applications more reliable, which is a concern in the field of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
