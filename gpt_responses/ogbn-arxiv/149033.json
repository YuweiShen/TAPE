These are all topics within the scope of computer vision.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a large-scale dataset of instructional videos, which is a type of multimedia data. The paper also proposes a new toolbox for annotating the videos effectively, which involves multimedia processing techniques.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for capturing dependencies among different steps in instructional videos, which can be used for action detection. This involves machine learning techniques such as feature extraction and classification.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions evaluation criteria for instructional video analysis, which includes metrics such as mean average precision (MAP) and recall. These are commonly used in information retrieval tasks such as search and recommendation.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves annotating instructional videos with step descriptions, which involves natural language processing techniques such as text extraction and classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
