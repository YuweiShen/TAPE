The use of PSK modulation and the characterization of performance using a metric called PSK Index Coding Gain (PSK-ICG) suggests a focus on digital signal processing and network information theory (cs.NI and cs.SI). The mention of a proposed algorithm for finding the best (index code, mapping) pairs also suggests a focus on optimization and algorithms (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
