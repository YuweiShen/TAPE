The algorithm is distributed and exploits double-separability, which involves distributing both data and model parameters simultaneously across multiple machines, making it relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses achieving good test accuracy, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
