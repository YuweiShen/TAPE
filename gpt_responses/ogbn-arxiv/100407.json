This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of deep learning techniques. The paper also discusses the impact of uncertainty on the system, which relates to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
