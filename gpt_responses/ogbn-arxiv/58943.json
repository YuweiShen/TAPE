The paper also discusses the tractability of containment for a subclass of ShEx, which involves computational complexity (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the graphical representation of shape graphs, which is related to visualization and graph theory (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the semantics of embedding RDF graphs in shape graphs, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
