It may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as entity linking is a sub-task of information retrieval. Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Finally, the use of multi-lingual embeddings suggests that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
