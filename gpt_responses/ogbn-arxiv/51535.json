The paper also addresses the issue of accuracy degradation in DNNs due to line-resistance induced errors, which is a topic of interest in the fields of Architecture (cs.AR), Neural Networks (cs.NE), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes algorithms for optimizing the crossbar re-arrangement, which involves the use of memristive devices, falling under the category of Electronic Devices and Materials (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
