The paper also mentions the fragility of these components and their algorithms, which is a software engineering (cs.SE) concern. Additionally, the paper discusses the need for expertise from outside software engineering, which could fall under the categories of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) or Cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the need to identify implicit assumptions made by practitioners in different fields, which could fall under the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
