The paper also proposes a method for automated feature engineering, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of surrogate models and the analysis of tabular data sets suggest a focus on data science (cs.DS) and computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the mention of benchmarking on several data sets suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
