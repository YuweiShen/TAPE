The paper also heavily relies on deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a stopping criterion based on measuring the orthogonality between signal and noise, which could be related to information theory (cs.IT) or neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
