It also proposes a solution for authentication using behavioral biometrics to mitigate these risks. This makes cs.CR the most likely category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the usability and convenience of smartphones and tablets, as well as the potential risks associated with their use. It also proposes a solution for authentication that takes into account the user's behavior, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction.\n\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the societal implications of smartphones and tablets, particularly the risks associated with their use. It also proposes a solution for authentication that takes into account the user's behavior, which is a key aspect of the relationship between computers and society.\n\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the social implications of smartphones and tablets, particularly the risks associated with their use.
