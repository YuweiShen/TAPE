Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the analysis of performance and optimization, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The use of local information and the avoidance of per-flow information could also indicate a focus on distributed systems, which could place the paper in cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
