The paper also proposes a methodology for producing engineering-type diagrams of machine processes, which can be applied to various domains and falls under the cs.SI sub-category. The paper also discusses the heterogeneity and variability of the context of use, which is a common concern in software engineering (cs.SE) and cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential use of the proposed methodology in designing UIs for certain environments, which may involve deep learning (cs.DL) techniques for optimizing the UI design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
