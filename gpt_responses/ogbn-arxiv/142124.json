The different settings considered in the paper, such as connectivity, rectangularity, and convexity, suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of protocols to achieve different trade-offs between fairness and ownership rights suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
