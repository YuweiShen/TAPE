The study also involves the use of technology (eye-tracking) to understand this interaction. \n\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses a societal issue related to pedestrian safety and driver behavior. It also highlights the misconception that pedestrians make eye contact with drivers, which has implications for road safety policies. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The study involves analyzing the behavior of pedestrians and drivers in a social context, i.e., on the road. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for social networks of pedestrians and drivers. \n\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper uses eye-tracking technology to understand the visual perception of pedestrians and drivers. This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - While not directly related to cryptography or security, the paper does discuss a safety issue related to pedestrians and drivers. The authors also suggest potential solutions to improve pedestrian safety, which could involve security measures such as surveillance cameras."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
