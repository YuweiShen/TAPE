The paper also discusses the construction of minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of linear codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the capacity of the secure coding scheme, which involves the analysis of information flow and communication complexity, falling under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
