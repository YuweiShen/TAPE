The use of value abstraction involves grouping variable values, which is a technique that can also be applied in data management (cs.DB) and data mining (cs.DM). The paper also mentions the use of evidence-specific value abstraction, which can be seen as a form of selective inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
