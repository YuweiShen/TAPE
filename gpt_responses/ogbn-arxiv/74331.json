The use of kernels is also a key aspect of the proposed technique. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as they are also relevant to the topic. The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI) as it deals with estimating non-linear functions from noisy data, which further supports the inclusion of these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
