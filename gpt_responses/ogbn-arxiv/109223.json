This involves planning the motion of a tool to fracture the contact regions between support components and the part, while avoiding collisions with the evolving near-net shape and remaining support components. This falls under the domain of robotics and motion planning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the evolving near-net shape, which could potentially involve 3D scanning or imaging techniques to capture the shape of the part and support structure. Additionally, computer vision techniques could be used to analyze the geometry of the support structure and identify regions that can be accessed for removal. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves generating a process plan for removing support structures from a 3D printed part, which could involve visualizing the part and support structure in a graphical format. Additionally, the paper mentions constructing a search graph whose edges are weighted by the Riemannian distance between fibers, which could involve graphical representations of the fibers and their distances. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves generating a process plan for removing support structures from a 3D printed part, which could involve multimedia techniques such as 3D modeling and simulation. Additionally, the paper mentions using a motion planner to find collision-free paths for the tool to visit all"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
