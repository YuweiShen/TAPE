These tasks are related to computer vision and image processing, which are covered by the computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper proposes a deep residual network for learning an end-to-end mapping between Bayer images and high-resolution images, which involves machine learning and deep learning techniques covered by the machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with image processing and restoration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
