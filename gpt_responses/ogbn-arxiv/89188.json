The paper proposes a new single-shot based detector that achieves better accuracy than two-stage methods while maintaining comparable efficiency of one-stage methods. This involves designing new modules and loss functions, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions transfer connection blocks, which suggests the use of neural networks for feature transfer (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
