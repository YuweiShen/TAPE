The paper also discusses the efficiency and performance of the proposed approach, which involves dividing the translation process between the accelerator and memory sides, and logically partitioning the memory space. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under the sub-categories of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), programming languages (cs.PL), systems and control (cs.SY), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
