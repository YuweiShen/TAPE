This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed method involves recalibrating learned feature maps using computational blocks, which can be seen as a form of network architecture design (cs.LG). The method also involves boosting meaningful features while suppressing weak ones, which can be seen as a form of feature selection or feature engineering (cs.AI). The proposed method involves introducing variants of 'squeeze & excitation' (SE) modules, which are a form of neural network design (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
