Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a traffic mobility model for VANET simulations, which involves updating the position of each vehicle based on car-following and lane-changing rules. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper uses a shadow fading path loss model to account for the impact of LOS obstruction, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
