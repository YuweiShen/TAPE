The focus of the paper is on improving the speed and memory usage of the decoding process, which suggests that it could also be relevant to networking and communication (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of single bit values instead of fixed point ones could also be related to data structures (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
