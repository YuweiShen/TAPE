Additionally, the paper proposes a system for symbol manipulation, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the possibility of using the proposed system as an alternative to the traditional binary system, which falls under the category of Control and Systems Engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a new fractal equation resulting from division, which could be of interest to researchers in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
