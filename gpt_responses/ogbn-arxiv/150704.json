Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also leverages existing OCR engines, which involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hence, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also likely. The proposed method involves training a neural network, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (ML). Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques such as text recognition. Hence, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as attention models for decoding textual content. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
