The paper focuses on optimizing the UAV's trajectory, bandwidth allocation, and user partitioning to maximize the minimum throughput of all MTs. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper considers orthogonal spectrum sharing and spectrum reuse between the UAV and ground base station (GBS) to effectively avoid mutual interference and maximize the spatial throughput. Information theory concepts such as bandwidth allocation and channel capacity are used in the optimization framework. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a cyclical multiple access design for the UAV to fly cyclically along the cell edge and offload data traffic for cell-edge MTs. The paper also considers the control of interference between the UAV and GBS in the spectrum reuse scheme. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper focuses on improving the spatial throughput of cellular networks, which is important for supporting multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper leverages the use of UAVs as an aerial mobile base station, which is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle.
