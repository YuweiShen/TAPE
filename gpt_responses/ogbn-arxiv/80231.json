This involves computer vision techniques such as semantic segmentation and 3D surface construction, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The system is designed for hospitalised patients, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of neural networks for multi-task learning and estimation also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
