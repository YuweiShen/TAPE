The aspect ratio of the regions in the treemap is an important quality criterion, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of computational geometry concerned with shape optimization (cs.GR). The use of polygons instead of rectangles to obtain bounded aspect ratio suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) concerned with image and video processing. Finally, the paper introduces a new type of treemap, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI) concerned with the visualization of network data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
