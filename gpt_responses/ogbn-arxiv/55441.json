The algorithms also involve approximation techniques, which could fall under the category of approximation algorithms (cs.AL). The paper also discusses the impact of the maximum degree and edge weights on the running time, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of graph theory (cs.GT) and network algorithms (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
