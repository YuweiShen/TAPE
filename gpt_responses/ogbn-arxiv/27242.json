The paper specifically focuses on the impact of these attacks on image classification tasks, which suggests that it may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the resilience of deep neural networks, which is a topic that falls under both artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses possible mitigations and future research directions, which suggests that it may also fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
