The use of finite fields in the channel inputs and outputs suggests a focus on coding theory and algebraic coding (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of functional-decode-forward coding strategy, which is a technique commonly used in network information theory (cs.SI). The paper also mentions rate splitting and joint source-channel decoding, which are techniques used in communication complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions joint source-channel decoding, which is a technique used in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
