This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CR sub-category. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system where EVs are connected to the power grid through an aggregator, and proposes a detection engine that monitors the timing requirements of the protocol messages to enhance the safety of the aggregator. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.SY sub-category. \n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with the integration of electric vehicles with the power grid, which has implications for the societal impact of technology. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CY sub-category. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with the integration of distributed energy resources with the power grid, which involves distributed computing and communication. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DC sub-category. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a novel Cyber-Physical Anomaly Detection Engine to monitor system behavior and detect anomalies almost"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
