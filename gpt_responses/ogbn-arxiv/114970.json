The primary focus is on the use of Apache Spark for data preparation and feature engineering, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) and databases (cs.DB). The use of neural networks for classification tasks falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the integration of these tools with the HEP environment falls under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
