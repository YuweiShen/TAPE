Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper mentions hyperparameter search algorithms, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
