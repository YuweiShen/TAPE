This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed technique is intended for use in 5G millimeter-wave systems, which are a part of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions the use of millimeter-wave frequencies, which are commonly used for multimedia applications such as high-speed data transfer and video streaming.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new technique for multiple access, which can be considered a system-level solution for improving the performance of millimeter-wave systems.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): This category is less likely, but the paper may have implications for society in terms of improving the performance and efficiency of 5G networks, which are becoming increasingly important for communication and information exchange."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
