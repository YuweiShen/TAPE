The algorithm presented in the paper involves finding parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph, which is a common technique in algorithm design and analysis (cs.DS). The problem of maximizing angular resolution can be seen as an optimization problem, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves analyzing the running time of the algorithm, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper deals with the practical application of the algorithm, which is a topic in computational science and engineering (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
