The paper also trains an existing state-of-the-art model on the proposed dataset, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The dataset also includes camera parameters, which could be relevant to graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the descriptors on publicly available benchmarks, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
