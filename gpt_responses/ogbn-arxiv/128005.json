The algorithms are tested on a variety of environments, including robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses challenges and future directions for model-based RL, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
