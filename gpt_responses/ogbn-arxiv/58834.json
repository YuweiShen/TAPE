The paper also explores the impact of synaptic precision restrictions on the synthesis process, which is related to the optimization of deep neural networks (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper focuses on the application of these techniques to computer vision tasks, such as object detection (cs.CV), which is a common area of research for deep neural networks. The use of probabilistic generative modeling strategies and evolutionary processes also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
