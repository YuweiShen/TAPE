The paper proposes an unsupervised learning algorithm that adapts to streaming data sources, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The problem of adapting to changing data sources is also relevant to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper validates its approach on real-world video datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
