Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of computers to process language in a more human way, which is a key aspect of AI. Additionally, the paper presents applications that demonstrate the power of this method, which is also relevant to AI.\n\n3. cs.LG (Learning): Although Rhetorical Analysis does not require large sets of training data, it still involves learning from text and identifying patterns. Therefore, cs.LG is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses Document Summarization, which is a sub-field of Information Retrieval. Therefore, cs.IR is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential impact of Rhetorical Analysis on NLP and presents applications that could have real-world implications. Therefore, cs.CY is a possible sub-category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
