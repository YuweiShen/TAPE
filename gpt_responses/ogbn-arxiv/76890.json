It also involves the use of two networks and joint loss, which are common techniques in deep learning. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision research, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Clothing1M. \n\nAdditionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep learning is a subfield of AI and the proposed method aims to improve the performance of weakly-supervised learning. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the proposed method involves the use of joint loss and Co-Regularization, which are techniques commonly used in natural language processing. \n\nFinally, it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as the problem of learning with noisy labels is also relevant in the context of adversarial attacks and defense in deep learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
