The proposed method also involves generating virtual points in feature space, which could be relevant to research on geometric deep learning (cs.GR) and manifold learning (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper mentions using the method for text clustering, which could relate to research on natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
