The use of seq2seq, a popular network in neural machine translation, also supports this categorization. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a proof-synthesis method for propositional logic using a DNN, which falls under the umbrella of AI. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses seq2seq, a network commonly used in natural language processing, to generate proofs encoded as $\\lambda$-terms. \n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with proof synthesis in propositional logic, which is a subfield of logic in computer science. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a method for generating proofs, which is relevant to programming languages and their formal verification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
