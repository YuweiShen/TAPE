The paper proposes a method to overcome catastrophic forgetting, which is a well-known problem in neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
