The paper investigates the policy evaluation problem in a fully decentralized setting, using temporal-difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation to handle large state spaces in practice. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
