It proposes a semi-stochastic model that samples intermediate observations and outcomes from a factored joint distribution, and proposes two neural network architectures to exploit these observations. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and statistical inference (cs.SI), and deals with data analysis and modeling (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
