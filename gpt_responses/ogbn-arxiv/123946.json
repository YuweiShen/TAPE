The paper also considers directed switching communication topologies, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The concept of norm synchronization is also discussed, which is related to the field of neural networks (cs.NE) and signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY, followed by cs.MA, cs.DC, cs.NE, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
