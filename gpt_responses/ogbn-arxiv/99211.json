This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for marker detection and pose estimation, as well as graphics (GR) and robotics (RO) for projection mapping. The use of optical fibers and LEDs also involves multimedia (MM) and human-computer interaction (HC) aspects. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.RO, cs.MM, and cs.HC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
