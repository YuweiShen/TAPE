The paper proposes a neural network architecture for content selection and planning in data-to-text generation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related areas. The paper also uses large-scale datasets and neural network models, which are common in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), so cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. The paper's focus on end-to-end training and neural network architecture suggests that it could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), which covers the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. Additionally, the paper's use of automatic and human-based evaluation experiments suggests that it could be classified under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which covers the development and application of neural networks and other computational models inspired by biological systems. Finally, the paper's focus on generating documents based on data records suggests that it could be classified under cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which covers the development of algorithms and models for searching and retrieving information from large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
