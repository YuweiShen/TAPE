The paper also introduces a robust formulation of the problem, which is of interest in many practical applications. The paper uses techniques from algorithms, optimization, and information theory, and is likely to be of interest to researchers in these areas. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
