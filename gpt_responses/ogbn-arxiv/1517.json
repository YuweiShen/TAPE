This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions an inpainting problem on the sphere, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Computer Graphics (cs.CG) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories.
