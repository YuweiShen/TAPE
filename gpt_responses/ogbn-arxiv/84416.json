The proposed fairness measure, MMA, involves ensuring that every agent is aware that she does not envy at least one other agent, which requires some level of reasoning and decision-making, suggesting a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an approximately fair allocation, which involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms, indicating a link to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the egalitarian guarantee and existence of the proposed fairness measure and its relaxations, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization, suggesting a connection to mathematical aspects of computer science (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
