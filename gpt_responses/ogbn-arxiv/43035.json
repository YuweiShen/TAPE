The proposed algorithm is formulated as an instance of General Pattern Search (GPS) framework, which is a well-known optimization method (cs.NA). The paper also evaluates the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real datasets, which involves computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data science (cs.DS) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
