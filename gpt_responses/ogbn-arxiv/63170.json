The concept of local dependencies is related to information theory (cs.IT) and the study of asymmetric (semi)graphoids is relevant to the field of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the properties of local independence, which is a fundamental concept in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on graph separation and its properties is relevant to the field of social network analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
