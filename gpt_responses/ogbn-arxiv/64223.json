The use of a tunable information leakage measure also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG), where privacy-preserving techniques are often used. The problem formulation and solution approach may also involve techniques from data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB), as the authors consider the utility of the disclosed data and the mechanism for data disclosure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
