This is a clear indication that it could belong to the Multimedia sub-category.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a method for copyright protection of digital images, which involves embedding a watermark using a secret key. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves processing of digital images using techniques such as DFT and DCT. This is a common theme in the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition sub-category.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions the use of watermarking for indexation, which is a common application of information retrieval. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval sub-category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves the use of signal processing techniques such as DFT and DCT, which are commonly used in information theory. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
