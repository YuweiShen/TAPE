The focus on safety-critical applications suggests a potential connection to computer security (cs.CR). The use of reliability diagrams and other visualization techniques suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of probability theory suggests a potential connection to statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
