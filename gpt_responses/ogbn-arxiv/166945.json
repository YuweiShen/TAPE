It also involves optimization of the approximation function, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper proposes new principles and metrics to evaluate and design the approximation function, which can be considered as a form of algorithm design and analysis (cs.SI). The use of subchannel selection and reliability sorting also suggests a possible connection to network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of polar codes, which can be seen as a form of machine learning or statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
