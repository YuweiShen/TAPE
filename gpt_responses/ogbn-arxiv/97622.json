Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms for candidate selection, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of deep learning techniques for scoring functions and appearance representation also suggests the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with tracking people, which is a common application in robotics, suggesting the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
