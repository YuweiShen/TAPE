This involves using visual-inertial odometry and maximizing the visibility of a point of interest while minimizing its velocity in the image plane. The paper also discusses the challenges of considering both perception and action objectives for motion planning and control. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Computer Vision (cs.CV), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
