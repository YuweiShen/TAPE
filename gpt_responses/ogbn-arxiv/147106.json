The paper proposes a distributed algorithm that leverages the physical layer capabilities of the network to achieve higher rates, which is a problem that is relevant to all of these sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, and cs.SY, followed by cs.MM and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
