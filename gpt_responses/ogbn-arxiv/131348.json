The proposed method also involves modeling gaze as a latent variable, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper focuses on social interactions between humans and robots, which is a key area of research in human-computer interaction. The proposed method aims to estimate and track visual cues that are important in social interactions. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper deals with interactions between humans and robots, and proposes a method for tracking visual cues that can be used in robotics applications. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with visual cues in social interactions, which is a topic that falls under multimedia research. The proposed method can be used to analyze and understand multimedia data from social interactions. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The proposed method involves a Bayesian switching state-space model, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence. The method also involves online inference, which is a key area of research in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
