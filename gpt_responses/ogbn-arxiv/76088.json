The paper also introduces and studies refinements and nonlinear analogues of L(k, q), which are combinatorial in nature and related to coding theory and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The upper and lower bounds provided in the paper involve techniques from combinatorics and algebraic geometry, which are also relevant to computer science theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the maximum number of nonzero weights a linear code can have, which is related to error-correcting codes and cryptography, both of which are topics in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves numerical computations and optimization, which are relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
