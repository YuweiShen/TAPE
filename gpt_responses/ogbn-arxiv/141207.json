Specifically, it proposes a novel way of representation learning to obtain features of drugs and diseases by combining complementary information available in unstructured texts and structured datasets. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
