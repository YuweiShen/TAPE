The paper also proposes a new quantization method for approximating the ReLU non-linearity, which is commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of batch normalization, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks for improving training performance (cs.NE). The paper also proposes a new method for approximating non-linearities, which is a topic that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on several popular deep learning architectures, which is a topic that falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
