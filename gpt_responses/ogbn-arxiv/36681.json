The focus on multi-agent systems suggests the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as another likely sub-category. The use of neural networks also suggests the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the investigation of network architectures for coordination and value functions suggests the category of systems and control (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
