The proposed method involves a non-convex optimization program over the space of sparse, low Tucker-rank tensors. This work involves topics related to machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), signal processing (cs.SI), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
