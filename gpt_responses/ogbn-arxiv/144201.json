The proposed approach also addresses the issue of overfitting, which is a common challenge in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of transfer learning is also a key aspect of the proposed approach, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of deep neural networks, which is a subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with hyperspectral data, which is often used in remote sensing and image retrieval applications (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
