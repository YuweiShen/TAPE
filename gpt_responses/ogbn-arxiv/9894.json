The paper also discusses the use of packed representation of strings, which is a common technique in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The algorithm presented in the paper involves automaton construction, which is a topic in formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper presents a new compact representation of subautomata, which is related to compression and information theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
