Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a multi-utility learning framework that can learn from different forms of supervision, which is a topic in machine learning (LG). Hence, cs.LG is the second most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of loss functions for quantifying the consistency of solutions with weak annotations, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational linguistics (CL). Therefore, cs.AI and cs.CL are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with image segmentation, which is a topic in multimedia (MM). Hence, cs.MM is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
