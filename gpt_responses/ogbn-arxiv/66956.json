The paper proposes a method for quantizing neural networks, which is a topic related to optimization and learning (cs.LG). The proposed method is evaluated on image classification tasks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed solution on an FPGA, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR) and neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
