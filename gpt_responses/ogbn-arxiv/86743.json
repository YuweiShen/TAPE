The paper also focuses on the use of autoregressive policies for exploration, which is relevant to the sub-field of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes empirical results on real-world robotic hardware, which suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
