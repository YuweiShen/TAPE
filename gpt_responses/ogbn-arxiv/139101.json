It could also belong to cs.SD (Sound) as it deals with the audio aspect of multi-party interaction. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as it discusses the design of \"smart\" multi-party applications. The paper also touches upon the use of AI in modeling multi-party interaction, which could place it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the study of sociable talk and its organization within small groups could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
