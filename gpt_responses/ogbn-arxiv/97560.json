The use of approximation algorithms and linear programming suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The practical applications of the problems in cloud computing and enterprise resource planning suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of social and information networks (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
