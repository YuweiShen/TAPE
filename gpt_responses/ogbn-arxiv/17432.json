The paper specifically focuses on the setting where data is distributed unevenly over a large number of nodes, which suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the need for communication efficiency, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). The paper proposes a new algorithm, which suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY) or \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
