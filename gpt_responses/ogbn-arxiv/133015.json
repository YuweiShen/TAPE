This involves targeting subsets of the SNN to adapt to novel information while protecting the information in the remainder of the SNN from catastrophic forgetting. The paper also mentions the use of biological dopamine signals to boost STDP in the synapses of neurons associated with outlier information. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
