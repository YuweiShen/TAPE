This makes it highly relevant to the field of logic in computer science.\n\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the implementation of a new method for abstraction, which involves the use of programming languages and tools. This makes it relevant to the field of programming languages.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper presents a new method for abstraction in software verification, which is an important area of software engineering. The paper also discusses the implementation of the method and its potential impact on software engineering.\n\n4. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) - The paper discusses the use of SAT-solvers and logical reasoning in a new method for abstraction, which is an emerging technology in computer science. The paper also discusses the potential impact of the method on future research in this area.\n\n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) - The paper discusses the use of logical reasoning and abstraction in bit-level verification, which is highly relevant to the field of formal languages and automata theory.
