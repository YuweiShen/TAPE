The proposed method utilizes images for disambiguation, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (CV) techniques. The framework is based on machine learning (LG) and involves bidirectional translation, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the paper focuses on multi-modal translation, which involves both text and images, and thus falls under the category of multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
