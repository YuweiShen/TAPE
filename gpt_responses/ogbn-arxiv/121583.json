The method involves learning a residual policy, which is a modification of the behavior policy, and optimizing it to maximize a lower bound on policy performance. This involves solving an optimization problem, which is a common theme in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The proposed method is evaluated on a number of tasks, including image-based tasks, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
