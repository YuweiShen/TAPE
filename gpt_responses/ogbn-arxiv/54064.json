As such, it is most likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper makes use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to learn socially cooperative policies, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel attentive pooling mechanism, which involves the use of self-attention mechanisms, and this suggests that it may be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the modeling of Crowd-Robot Interaction (CRI), which involves the study of complex social systems, and this suggests that it may also be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
