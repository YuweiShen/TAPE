The use of multiple heuristics is also a common technique in search algorithms, which could place this paper in the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of lazy evaluation, which is a technique commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the proposed method involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
