The use of computational elements and the discussion of limitations also suggest a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of memory requirements and local-control algorithms may indicate a connection to computer architecture (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
