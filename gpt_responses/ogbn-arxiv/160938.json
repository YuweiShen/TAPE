Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of sparsity-inducing regularizers and $\\ell_1$-norm regularization suggests that the paper could also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
