The function is also related to evolutionary computation, which is a subfield of neural networks and learning (cs.NE). The analysis involves upper and lower bounds, which are often studied in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The function is also related to problem size, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions an algorithm to compute the exact black-box complexity, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
