The use of signal constellations and modulation techniques also suggests the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also briefly mentions extensions to higher numbers of antennas, which falls under the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the use of multiple antennas for spatial modulation falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
