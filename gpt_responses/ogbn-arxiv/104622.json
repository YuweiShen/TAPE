It also deals with parametric properties, which are often specified using programming languages (cs.PL). The paper proposes algorithms for monitoring these properties, which involves reasoning about logical constraints (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses limitations of existing approaches, which may involve security concerns (cs.CR) or the need for more advanced AI techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
