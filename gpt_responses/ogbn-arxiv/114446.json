The paper focuses on developing an unsupervised approach to identify text segments relevant to specific study parameters. This involves the use of binary classifiers and sentence selection techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also involves the use of AI and DL techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DL (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
