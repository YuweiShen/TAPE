It also utilizes heterogeneous lists (HList) which is a common technique in functional programming, making the programming language (Scala) a likely sub-category as well (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses various neural layers such as convolution and recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also showcases typesafe abstractions, which could be related to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with multidimensional arrays, which could be related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
