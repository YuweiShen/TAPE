The paper also discusses the use of coding techniques such as superposition coding, which is relevant to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the Gaussian MAC-IC-MAC, which is a specific type of communication system and falls under the category of multimedia communications (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the degrees of freedom of the system, which is a concept in communication complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
