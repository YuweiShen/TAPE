This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of an observational model to counter drift and collect relevant samples online, which involves machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and particle filters, falling under sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
