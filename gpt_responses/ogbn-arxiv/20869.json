Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves communication systems, which suggests cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) as another likely sub-category. The study of inner and outer bounds to capacity involves system theory, which could place the paper in cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of fading models and ergodic processes suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the study of capacity approaching strategies, which could place it in cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
