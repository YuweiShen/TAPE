This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves data rates and decoding orders. It also involves network interference (cs.NI) as the interference channel is memoryless and each receiver decodes the data of a subset of transmitters before decoding the data of the designated transmitter. The problem of maximizing the minimum rate of users is a fairness problem (cs.SI) and the paper proposes a greedy algorithm to solve it. The algorithm involves selecting the users which are decoded at each receiver, which is related to multiple access (cs.MM) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
