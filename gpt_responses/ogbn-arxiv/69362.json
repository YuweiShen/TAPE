Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers, which falls under the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also introduces new decompositions of constraints, which is related to the sub-category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Finally, the paper discusses the aim of democratizing CP-style modeling, which is related to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
