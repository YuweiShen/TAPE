The paper also mentions the use of vision in surgical procedures, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) may be relevant. The paper proposes a method for preventing collisions between robots and their environment, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using simulations and experiments, which may involve machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
