The presence of network externalities implies that the consumption decision of an agent depends not only on the price offered to her but also on the consumption decisions of her neighbors in the underlying network. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes an algorithm for estimating the matrix that captures the dependence of observable agents' consumption decisions on the prices offered to them. The algorithm is designed to handle high-dimensional data and provides convergence rates for the proposed estimator. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper discusses pricing strategies for a seller who has access to data on past consumption decisions/prices for a subset of observable agents and can target these agents with appropriate discounts to exploit network effects and increase her revenues. The seller aims to construct prices that lead to a small revenue loss relative to revenue-maximizing prices under complete information. \n4. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The paper considers a setting where multiple agents interact with each other through a social network and consume a product that exhibits positive local network externalities. The seller aims to exploit network effects and increase her revenues by targeting a subset of observable agents with appropriate discounts. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
