Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also uses techniques from bi-level optimization, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of inference, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
