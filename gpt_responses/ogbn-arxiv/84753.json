The paper also considers different notions of rationality, which is a key concept in multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The construction of examples to show exponential behavior suggests a focus on algorithms and complexity (cs.DS), while the consideration of utility functions suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
