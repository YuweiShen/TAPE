The paper proposes a PAC algorithm for this problem and establishes its sample complexity in terms of a new hardness parameter. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and systems and control (cs.SY). Among these, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely categories, as the paper deals with a fundamental problem in these fields and proposes a new algorithmic approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
