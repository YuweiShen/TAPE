This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-disciplines, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, given the focus on wireless communication systems and signal processing techniques, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories. The inclusion of simulations and performance metrics also suggests a focus on practical implementation and evaluation, which further supports these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
