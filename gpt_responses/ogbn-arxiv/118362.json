The use of heuristics to combine the predictions from the semantic and instance segmentation networks suggests that this paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a Pyramid Pooling Module in the semantic segmentation branch suggests that this paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper may also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it deals with the segmentation of natural language text. Finally, the submission of results to the COCO and Mapillary Joint Recognition Challenge 2018 suggests that this paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
