The method uses tempo modulation, which is a signal processing technique, making it relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SD). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the system, which involves cryptography and security (cs.CR) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper uses a coding scheme, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
