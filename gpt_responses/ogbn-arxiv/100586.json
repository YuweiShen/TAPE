The use of Sobolev dual frames is a technique from functional analysis, which suggests the paper may also be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of Gaussian distributions, which is a common topic in the Machine Learning (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves optimization and recovery methods, which are topics that may be relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
