The paper also proposes a new approach using time-smoothed gradients, which involves manipulating and analyzing data (cs.DS). The use of public data set GEFCom2014 suggests a focus on statistical modeling and time series analysis (cs.ST). Finally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
