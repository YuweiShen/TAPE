Therefore, cs.AI and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The method involves learning a vector-space embedding of entities, which is a common technique in machine learning and falls under cs.LG. The paper also discusses the usefulness of the subspaces for information retrieval, which is a topic in cs.IR.
