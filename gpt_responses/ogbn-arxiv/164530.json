The use of spatial and temporal attention models also suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The collaborative learning aspect of the proposed approach may also place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of fusion weights and the focus on discriminative features suggest that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the application of video search and surveillance suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
