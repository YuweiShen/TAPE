Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a training procedure to address this problem, which involves optimization and search algorithms, making it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of black-box models, which is a security concern, making it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper proposes a method to improve the robustness of models, which is related to the field of neural engineering, making it relevant to sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
