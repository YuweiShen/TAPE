This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI) domains. The paper also discusses the reduction of decoding complexity, which is a common concern in communication networks, making the computer networks (cs.NI) category a likely fit. Additionally, the paper involves the comparison of different codes, which could fall under the communication (cs.COMM) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
