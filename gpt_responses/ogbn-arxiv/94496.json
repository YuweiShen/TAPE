The paper provides a modular model library for BAS, which can be used to build complex models with stochasticity, non-linearities, numerous continuous variables or discrete states, various input and output signals, and a large number of possible discrete configurations. The paper also demonstrates the use of the model library for CPS benchmarks through three realistic case studies. Therefore, cs.SY is the most likely category for this paper.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the concepts and techniques used in the paper, such as modeling, control, and analysis of complex systems with physical and digital components, are relevant to robotics. Moreover, the paper provides a modular model library that can be used to build complex models of robotic systems. Therefore, cs.RO is a likely category for this paper.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses techniques from artificial intelligence, such as machine learning and optimization, to build and analyze complex models of BAS. Moreover, the paper provides a modular model library that can be used to build and test artificial intelligence algorithms for CPS. Therefore, cs.AI is a likely category for this paper.\n- cs.LG"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
