Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which is a common topic in machine learning, specifically in deep learning. This suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. Additionally, the paper draws upon ideas from smoothing in $n$-gram models, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed noising schemes also involve modifying the input data, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper provides empirical analysis, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
