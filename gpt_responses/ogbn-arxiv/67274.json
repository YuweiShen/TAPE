Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, which is relevant to this paper. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): Visible light communication is a type of wireless communication, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. The paper proposes a new scheme for VLC, which makes it likely to belong to this category. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Similar to the previous category, this paper is likely to belong to cs.NI due to its focus on visible light communication. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it is possible that machine learning techniques were used in the simulation or analysis of the proposed scheme. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Visible light communication is a type of multimedia communication, and the proposed scheme involves the use of non-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (NOFDM), which is a technique commonly used in multimedia communication. Therefore, this paper may belong to cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
