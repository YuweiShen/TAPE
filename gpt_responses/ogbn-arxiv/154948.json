The use of a multicriteria decision-making approach and a lattice-based discrete space suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect to the research. The paper also mentions the design of information systems (cs.DB) and the use of information retrieval techniques (cs.IR) in the context of academic applications.
