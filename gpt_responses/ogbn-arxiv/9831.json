The use of semantic embeddings and measurements also suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the real-world applications mentioned (bus delay forecasting and air quality forecasting) suggest a possible connection to social impact (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
