Additionally, the use of deep learning algorithms for feature extraction and classification makes it likely to belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the potential applications of the proposed method in human-computer interfaces, which suggests that it could belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of video datasets for experiments indicates that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
