The paper also discusses the importance of training data and proposes a hybrid loss function, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of leaky ReLU is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on a wind turbine, which is a topic related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
