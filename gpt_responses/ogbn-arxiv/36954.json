This involves the use of knowledge graphs, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and database (cs.DB) research. The paper also discusses the relationship between knowledge graphs and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) in knowledge-based approaches. Finally, the paper mentions the expansion of knowledge-based approaches to novel domains, such as Chinese Traditional Medicine and biodiversity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
