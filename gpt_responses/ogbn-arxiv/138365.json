The paper also proposes a new approach for watermarking neural networks, which involves modifying the prediction API of the model, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of adversarial techniques, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the proposed approach, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
