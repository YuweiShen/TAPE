The paper discusses the theoretical properties of the proposed method, including oracle complexities for strongly convex and non-strongly convex objectives. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.Optimization. The paper also discusses extensions to mini-batch and non-smooth settings, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper proposes a momentum acceleration trick, which is a common technique in deep learning research, suggesting that the paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
