This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also introduces texture randomization using Neural Style Transfer (NST) for training the CNN, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of CNNs for pose estimation is a machine learning (cs.LG) application, and the paper also discusses the performance of the network on spaceborne images, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
