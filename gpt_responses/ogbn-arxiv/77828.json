The paper proposes a regularization approach for instance-based superset label learning, which involves the use of a graph to represent the training set and a discrimination term to enlarge the gap of values between possible labels and unlikely labels for every training example. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
