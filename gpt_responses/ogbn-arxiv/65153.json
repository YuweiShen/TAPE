This makes cs.DS a likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Lin-Kernighan heuristic is a local search algorithm commonly used in AI for solving optimization problems. The paper proposes adaptations of this algorithm for the GTSP, which is an AI-related problem. Hence, cs.AI is another likely category.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The GTSP is a problem that arises in the field of robotics, where it is used to optimize the path planning of robots. The paper proposes adaptations of the Lin-Kernighan heuristic for the GTSP, making cs.RO a possible category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The Lin-Kernighan heuristic is a local search algorithm that can be used in machine learning for optimization problems. The paper proposes adaptations of this algorithm for the GTSP, which is an optimization problem.
