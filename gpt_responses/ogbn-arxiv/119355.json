Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY). Among these, machine learning (cs.LG) is the most likely category as the paper focuses on proposing methods for optimization and learning of the input convex neural network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
