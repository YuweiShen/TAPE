The proposed algorithm involves metric learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of Riemannian manifolds and kernels suggests a focus on geometric deep learning and manifold learning (cs.AI, cs.MM). Finally, the application of the algorithm to face recognition and object categorization suggests a focus on computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
