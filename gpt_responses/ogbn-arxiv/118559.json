Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and transmission schemes, making this category a likely fit. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a multiuser VLC network, which involves networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks): The paper proposes a transmission scheme for a communication network, making this category a possible fit. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with visible light communications, which is a form of multimedia communication. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes user ordering techniques and feedback schemes to improve the performance of the VLC network, which can be seen as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
