Additionally, the use of reinforcement learning and reward functions is a popular approach in NLP research. \n\nIt could also belong to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as reinforcement learning is a subfield of AI. \n\nThe sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) is also a possibility as the paper uses a machine learning approach (reinforcement learning) to improve the summarization task. \n\nInformation Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as text summarization is often used in information retrieval systems to provide users with a quick overview of a large document. \n\nFinally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is a less likely sub-category, but still possible as the paper may use neural networks as part of its approach to text summarization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
