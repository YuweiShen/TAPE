The proposed method also involves a scale regression layer, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of anchor convolution, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
