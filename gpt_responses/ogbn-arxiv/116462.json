The method uses a novel multivariable extremum seeking controller with adaptive step size, which involves control theory and system dynamics, making it relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The method also involves adaptive algorithms, which is relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper presents experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the method, which involves data analysis and machine learning, making it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the method, which involves software engineering and system design, making it relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
