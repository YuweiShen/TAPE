This involves extracting conditional information from the samples and forming bilinear features derived from the spatial cross product of an image and a condition vector. These methods are related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL) as they involve training models to generate realistic images with specific attributes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
