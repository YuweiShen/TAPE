The paper also focuses on image classification tasks (cs.CV) and discusses the information perspective of multiplicative noise, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions batch normalization, which is a common technique in neural network optimization and falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed technique on natural language processing tasks, which falls under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
