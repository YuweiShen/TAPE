Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also presents effective ways of integrating knowledge-attention with self-attention, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of external resources also implies information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the end-to-end and fully attention-based nature of the proposed system suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
