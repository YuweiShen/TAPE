The use of various strategies such as FPN, Cascade, Dcnv2, Non-local, and libra loss suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the proposed voting method for merging model results involves natural language processing techniques, which could place the paper in the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
