This makes cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) the most likely category. The paper also deals with analytical expressions of key performance metrics, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as another likely category. The safety-critical nature of vehicular communication systems and the need for validation and testing make cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible category. The paper also discusses the properties of signal propagation in different environments, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
