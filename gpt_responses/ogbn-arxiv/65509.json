The paper also evaluates the performance of F-W Net on handwritten digit recognition, which is a common task in machine learning. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes a convolutional version of F-W Net and applies it to image denoising and super-resolution tasks, which are common computer vision tasks. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a new nonlinear unit, $pool_p$, which is parameterized by $p$ and is used in F-W Net. This unit is inspired by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which is a popular optimization algorithm in neural networks. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new deep learning architecture, F-W Net, which can solve the $L_p$-norm constrained coding problem with unknown $p$. This is a common problem in artificial intelligence, where the optimal value of a hyper-parameter is not known beforehand. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of $L_p$-norm constrained coding, which is related to information theory and signal processing. The paper proposes a new deep learning architecture"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
