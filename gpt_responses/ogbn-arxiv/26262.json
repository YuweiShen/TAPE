As such, it is likely to fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the method involves the use of an episodic memory module and class relationships between nodes, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also applies the method to image search and few shot learning tasks, which could place it under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the method involves aggregating neighbourhood information, which could make it relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
