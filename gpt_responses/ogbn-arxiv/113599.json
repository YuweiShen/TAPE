The use of persistent homology and B-spline surface fitting techniques indicates that it could be related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The application of the proposed method on synthetic datasets, randomly generated PDs, and 3D CAD models suggests that it could also be related to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of dynamical systems data suggests that it could be related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the theoretical analysis of the stability of the proposed method suggests that it could also be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
