Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves probability and statistics, which suggests cs.PR (Probability) and cs.ST (Statistics) as possible sub-categories. The use of bounds and analysis suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as possible sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis, which suggests cs.MS (Mathematical Software) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
