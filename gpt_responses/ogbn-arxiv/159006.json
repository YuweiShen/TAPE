This makes it likely to belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a counting algorithm and investigates the statistics and probability distributions of the solution space, indicating a focus on Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Graph Theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
