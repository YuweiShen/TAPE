The focus on providing high-level numerical functions also aligns with the goals of mathematical software.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): Owl is a numerical library, and the paper discusses its core components and key functionality, which are likely to involve numerical analysis techniques.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the design of Owl, which is a software library, and the use of OCaml, which is a programming language. This could fall under the category of programming languages.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, Owl's focus on numerical functions could be useful for building machine learning applications. Additionally, the paper mentions that Owl includes support for automatic differentiation, which is a key technique used in machine learning.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of a software library, which could fall under the category of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
