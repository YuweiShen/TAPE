The concept of ego-munities is introduced, which are subjective communities centered around a given node. The paper also discusses the potential applications of ego-munities such as information inference and interest recommendations, which are relevant to the field of social and information networks. \n2. cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences) - The paper is rooted in sociological considerations and introduces a metric, the cohesion, to quantify the community-ness of a set of nodes. The concept of ego-munities is also based on social behavior and interactions. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents a heuristic algorithm to detect ego-munities based on maximizing their cohesion. The algorithmic approach is discussed in detail, and the paper also mentions the use of modularity and other methods from the field of disjoint community detection. \n4. cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) - The paper briefly mentions the potential use of ego-munities for cybersecurity applications such as identifying malicious actors in a network. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper discusses the potential use of ego-munities for personalized recommendations and information inference, which are relevant to the field of artificial intelligence.
