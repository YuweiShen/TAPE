The use of a sequence-to-sequence model for generating representations of discourse relational arguments also suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of a memory network could also suggest a focus on deep learning, which could place it in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a classifier for implicit discourse relation classification could suggest a focus on neural networks and optimization, which could place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the use of annotated data and the focus on classification could suggest a focus on information retrieval, which could place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
