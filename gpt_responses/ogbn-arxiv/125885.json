The paper proposes a new algorithm for nonparametric canonical correlation analysis (NCCA) that is memory-efficient and often runs much faster than existing methods. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
