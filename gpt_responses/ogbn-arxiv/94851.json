The paper also discusses unsupervised feature aggregation and re-ranking methods, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of heat diffusion as a simulation method is a unique approach that could potentially fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
