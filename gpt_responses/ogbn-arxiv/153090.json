The paper specifically focuses on MIMO communication, which is a key technology in modern wireless systems, and provides a contemporary perspective on the topic. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories, followed by cs.COMM, cs.SY, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
