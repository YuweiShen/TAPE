Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the training procedure and the use of residual networks (ResNets), which are popular in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.LG and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. The experiments are conducted on video datasets, indicating that cs.MM (multimedia) is also a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the issue of overfitting, which is a common problem in neural networks, suggesting that cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
