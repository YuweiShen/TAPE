This task falls under the sub-field of information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of unsupervised learning and distributed representations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the focus on expertise retrieval in online document collections may also make the paper relevant to the sub-field of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
