This involves coevolving a context module with a skill module, which recognizes variation and modulates the skill module for robust performance in previously unseen environments. This approach is evaluated in a challenging version of the Flappy Bird game, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the deployment of autonomous agents in domains such as autonomous driving, infrastructure management, health care, and finance, which suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
