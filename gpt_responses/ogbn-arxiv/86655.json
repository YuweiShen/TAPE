Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves control and optimization techniques, which suggests the category cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which suggests the category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves statistical characterization and semi-definite programming, which suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
