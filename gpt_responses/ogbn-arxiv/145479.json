Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which includes papers on NLP and speech processing. \n\nThe paper also proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based incremental processing approach, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the use of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module, which is related to signal processing (cs.SD). \n\nFinally, the paper evaluates its proposed approach on a benchmark dataset, which is related to experimental design and analysis (cs.EX).
