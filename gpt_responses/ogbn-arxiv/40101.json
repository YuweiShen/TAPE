The use of objective functions and the consideration of errors suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the mention of a rounding algorithm and approximation guarantees suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
