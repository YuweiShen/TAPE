The paper specifically discusses fuzzing and symbolic execution, which are commonly used in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also presents an open-source framework, which could fall under the programming languages (cs.PL) category. The use of SMT solvers in the paper could also place it under the systems and control (cs.SY) category.
