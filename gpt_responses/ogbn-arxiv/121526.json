Additionally, the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for capturing the articulated structure of the hand and estimating 3D positions respectively, suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning techniques for hand pose estimation also suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of depth maps as input and the focus on human-computer interaction suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
