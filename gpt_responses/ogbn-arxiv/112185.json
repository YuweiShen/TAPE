The approach uses pre-trained natural language modules such as semantic role labelers, coreference resolvers, and dependency parsers, which are commonly used in NLP and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also reasons over a wide range of semantic abstractions of the text, which involves machine learning and graph-based algorithms commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of information retrieval techniques and structured knowledge bases, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
