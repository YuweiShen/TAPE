The use of linear programming relaxations and extended formulations suggests that the paper may belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The implications for approximation, learning theory, and cryptography suggest that it may also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the use of pseudocalibration and the focus on LP/SDP lower bounds suggest that it may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
