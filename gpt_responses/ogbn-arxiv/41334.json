The paper also discusses algorithmic methods and proof-theoretic properties, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of coalgebraic semantics suggests a connection to the area of programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper's focus on deriving complexity bounds suggests a connection to the area of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
