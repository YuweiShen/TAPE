Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. The paper also discusses wireless channels, which makes cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a likely category as well. The proposed transmission method involves space-time interference alignment, which falls under cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper presents a trade-off between CSI feedback delay and degrees of freedom (DoF) gain, which can be analyzed using techniques from cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
