This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing CNN-based methods, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of Retinex-based methods, which are commonly used in graphics (cs.GR) research. The proposed method involves restoring lost pixel values, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents experimental results to compare the proposed method with existing methods, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
