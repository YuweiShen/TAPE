The paper focuses on computing semantic relatedness between entities and visualizing them in a user-friendly interface. This falls under the domain of information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves extracting relevant information from large datasets. Additionally, the paper also deals with natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves processing text from Wikipedia articles. The use of semantic relatedness also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques. Finally, the use of DBpedia involves database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
