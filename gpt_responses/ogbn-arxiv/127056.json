The paper also discusses the tradeoff between rate and coding gain, which is a common theme in signal processing and networked systems (cs.SI, cs.NI). Additionally, the paper uses algebraic number theory and Diophantine approximation to construct codes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
