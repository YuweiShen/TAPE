The paper also discusses the state-of-the-art performance of deep neural networks on machine vision tasks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper considers different types of quality distortions, which are relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
