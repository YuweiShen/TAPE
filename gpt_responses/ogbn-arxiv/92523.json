This involves machine learning and data mining techniques, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and databases (cs.DB). The use of multi-relations in the knowledge graph suggests the involvement of social network analysis (cs.SI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
