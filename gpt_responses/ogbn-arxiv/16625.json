The paper also introduces a new interactive annotation framework, which involves adapting an existing deep learning model (Mask-RCNN) and introducing a new loss function, which could be considered artificial intelligence (AI) research (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method and compares it to other methods, which could be considered machine learning (ML) research (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of scribbles as a form of interaction, which could be considered graphics (GR) research (cs.GR). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a dataset, which could be considered multimedia (MM) research (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
