The paper also mentions text field recognition, which is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR). The experimental baselines for text field recognition suggest the use of machine learning algorithms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The dataset is composed of video clips, which suggests the use of multimedia techniques (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the challenges of modern mobile-based document OCR, which suggests the use of cryptography and security techniques (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
