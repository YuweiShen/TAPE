Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the potential of the new activation function to improve generalization in neural networks, which is a topic related to machine learning and statistics. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper mentions that the new activation function can be used for various natural operations, such as polynomials and sinusoids, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential of the new activation function to improve neural network learning, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
