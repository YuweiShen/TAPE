The paper also discusses the use of this encoding for reasoning about proofs and formulas, which falls under the category of computational logic (cs.CL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the encoding using the Teyjus implementation of lambdaProlog, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the encoding, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves optimizing the performance of a computational system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
