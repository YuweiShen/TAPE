The paper discusses the optimization of large-batch training, which is a common problem in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the design and implementation of a system for customized-precision distributed deep learning, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for gradient shifting, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
