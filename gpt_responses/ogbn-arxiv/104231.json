This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves the use of neural networks. The approach also involves the use of nonlinear differential terms, which falls under the category of neural networks and evolutionary computation (cs.NE). The paper also deals with spatio-temporal datasets, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The approach is used for modeling time-dependent data, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper compares the approach to other data-discovery methods, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
