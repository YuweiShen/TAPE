This approach falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with text content in both English and Chinese, which suggests it could also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. The use of CNN models for feature extraction and fusion also suggests relevance to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
