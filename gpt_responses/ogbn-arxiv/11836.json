This category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Bitcoin's underlying technology is based on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of nodes. This category is also a likely fit.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Bitcoin's blockchain is a complex data structure that requires efficient algorithms to maintain and update. This category is a possible fit.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Bitcoin's ecosystem includes various software components, such as wallets, mining software, and trading platforms. This category is a possible fit.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): Bitcoin has implications for society, including its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and its use in illegal activities.
