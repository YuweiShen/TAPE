This involves image analysis and feature extraction, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses a deep convolutional neural network learning architecture to realize custom radiomic sequencers. This involves machine learning techniques for training and optimizing the neural network. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses AI techniques such as deep learning to predict lung cancer from CT imaging data. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper involves retrieving information from CT imaging data to predict lung cancer. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with analyzing and processing multimedia data in the form of CT imaging data to predict lung cancer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
