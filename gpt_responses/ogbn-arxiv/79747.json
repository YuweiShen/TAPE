The use of feedback vertex set number and tree likeness in the algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), network optimization (cs.NE), computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
