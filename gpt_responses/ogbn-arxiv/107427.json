It also involves developing efficient algorithms for different types of loss functions, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of restricted feedback and the focus on ranking documents also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the application of the algorithms on benchmark datasets may involve computer vision (cs.CV) if the datasets involve images or videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
