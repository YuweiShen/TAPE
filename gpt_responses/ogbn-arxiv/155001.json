The concept of asymptotic mean stationarity is also relevant to signal processing and machine learning, which are covered by sub-categories such as cs.SI (signal processing), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.MM (multimedia). Additionally, the application of the ergodic decomposition to obtain source coding theorems is relevant to control theory, which is covered by cs.SY (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
