The paper also discusses the scaling of blocklength with respect to the gap between code rate and channel capacity, which is a topic in coding theory and communication complexity (cs.CC). The numerical computations and conjectures made in the paper also involve statistical inference and machine learning (cs.SI), as well as algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on polynomial computations and bounds suggests a connection to computational complexity and theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
