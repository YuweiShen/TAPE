The study also involves analyzing the solution space of these formulas, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The empirical and theoretical results are obtained through experiments and proofs, respectively, which involve data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
