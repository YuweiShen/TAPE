The paper also introduces a new estimator that is robust to local non-uniformity, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper demonstrates the performance of the proposed estimator on both synthetic and real-world data, which is a common theme in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
