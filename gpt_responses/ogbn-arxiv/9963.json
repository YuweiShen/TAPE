The use of planar separators and structural properties of levels suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GR). The approximation algorithm for the $(n/r)$-level also suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
