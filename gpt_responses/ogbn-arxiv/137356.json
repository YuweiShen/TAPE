The paper also discusses the storage and querying of system-call level audit logs, which involves database systems, making cs.DB (Databases) a likely sub-category. The paper mentions the use of graph-based databases, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as graph-based databases are often used in machine learning applications. The paper also discusses the design and implementation of GrAALF, which involves software engineering principles, making cs.SE (Software Engineering) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of different storage solutions, including main memory and hybrid main memory databases, which involves programming languages and compilers, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
