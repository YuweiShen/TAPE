The paper proposes a new theoretical foundation for the Straight-Through (ST) estimator, which is a widely used technique for back-propagating gradients through discrete random variables. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a new estimator variant that performs better on distributions with infinite support, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also includes experiments on image data, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper's focus on gradient estimation and optimization makes it relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper's theoretical foundation and focus on control and optimization make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
