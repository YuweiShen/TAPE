The use of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas for expressing high-level goals indicates that it could also belong to the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The design of control protocols and the cooperative transportation of objects by the agents suggests that it could belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of a finite transition system to abstract the behavior of the agents and objects suggests that it could belong to the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
