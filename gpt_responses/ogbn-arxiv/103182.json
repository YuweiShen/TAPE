This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) category. However, the paper also discusses the use of abstractions and lattices, which are common techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the reuse of proof strategies for related conjectures, which is a topic in Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LO, cs.AI, and cs.PL, followed by cs.SE and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
