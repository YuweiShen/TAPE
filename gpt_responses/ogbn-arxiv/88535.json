Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves analyzing the properties of the embeddings, which could fall under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of variance-based embedding post-processing techniques, which could be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper offers guidelines on embedding post-processing, which could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
