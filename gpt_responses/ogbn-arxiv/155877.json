This suggests a logical approach to the problem, making cs.LO a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of an instruction set to compute total functions on meadows. This involves the manipulation of data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS a possible sub-category.\n3. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) - The paper deals with the computation of functions using a specific set of instructions. This involves the study of formal languages and automata theory, making cs.FL a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the complexity of computing total functions on meadows using straight-line programs with a limited number of auxiliary variables. This involves the study of computational complexity, making cs.CC a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the computation of functions using a specific set of instructions, which involves the manipulation of information.
