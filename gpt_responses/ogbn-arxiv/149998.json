This involves using multimodal sequence to sequence learning architecture to learn joint semantic representations of bilingual API sequences from big source code data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper deals with the challenge of migrating language-specific APIs to corresponding APIs written in other languages, which is a key aspect of software engineering. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses sequence to sequence learning architecture to learn joint semantic representations of bilingual API sequences, which is a natural language processing technique. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning techniques to develop an intelligent system for mining API mappings, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the challenge of finding relevant API mappings from a large-scale code corpus, which is a key aspect of information retrieval. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with the challenge of migrating language-specific APIs to corresponding APIs written in other languages, which is a key aspect of programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
