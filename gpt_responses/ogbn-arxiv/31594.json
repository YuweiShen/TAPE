Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a non-convex algorithm that exploits the low-rank property of the Hankel matrix, which is a structured matrix commonly used in signal processing. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SI (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper uses theoretical analysis and empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which may fall under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
