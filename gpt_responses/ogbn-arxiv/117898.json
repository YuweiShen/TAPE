The paper proposes a new scheme called SQCLP, which is an extension of CLP, a subfield of logic and constraint programming (cs.LO). The paper also presents a declarative semantics for SQCLP, which is a fundamental aspect of programming languages and falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper discusses the implementation-independent notion of goal solutions, which is a topic that falls under the category of databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper deals with the efficient computation over specialized domains, which is a topic that falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
