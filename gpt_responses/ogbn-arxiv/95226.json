However, ultrasound sensors can be considered as a form of sensing and perception, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a less likely category as the paper focuses more on the machine learning aspect rather than the control theory aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
