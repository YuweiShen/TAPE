The paper also discusses the space complexity of inner product estimation, which is a problem in information theory (cs.IT). The paper uses techniques from compressed sensing and dimensionality reduction, which are topics in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of estimation functions, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses lower bounds on the amount of information needed to solve the problem, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
