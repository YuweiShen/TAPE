The paper presents a randomized online algorithm that beats the previously known half competitiveness bound. This result is of interest to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
