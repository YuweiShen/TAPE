Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves algebraic constructions and analysis of the functions, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of polynomials and symmetric functions suggests a possible fit with cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
