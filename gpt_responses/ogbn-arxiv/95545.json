The expansion of the region where the reliability function is known exactly may involve mathematical analysis and algorithms, which could fall under computer science (cs.DS). The reliability function of a BSC is also relevant in the context of network information theory (cs.SI) and communication networks (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
