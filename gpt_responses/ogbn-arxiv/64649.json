The paper proposes a new approach to training the discriminator network in GANs, which involves feeding it with mixed batches of true and fake samples and training it to predict the ratio of true samples in the batch. This approach is designed to address the problem of mode dropping, which occurs when the generator models only part of the target distribution. The paper also introduces a new permutation-invariant discriminator architecture that is provably a universal approximator of all symmetric functions. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
