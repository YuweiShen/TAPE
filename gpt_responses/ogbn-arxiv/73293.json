The paper also involves optimization techniques such as online mirror descent, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The concept of risk is also a common topic in control engineering (cs.CE) and information theory (cs.IT), which could be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
