Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of a decentralized ledger and cryptographic tokens, which suggests a possible fit with cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also mentions the use of a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function, which could be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
