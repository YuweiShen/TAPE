This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for obstacle detection and robotics (RO) for MAV navigation. The proposed architecture is a deep neural network, which involves machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of multitask learning, which involves neural networks and optimization techniques (NE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
