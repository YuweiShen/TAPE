This falls under the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the practical implications of the proposed model for course selection and improving academic performance, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and computer education (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning techniques in the proposed model, which could also fall under the category of deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
