The use of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) suggests that the paper could belong to cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.IR (information retrieval). The mention of datasets and data distributions suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.DB (databases). The mention of experiments on real-world datasets suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CV (computer vision) or cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
