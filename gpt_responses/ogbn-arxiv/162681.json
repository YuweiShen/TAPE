The use of generalized butterfly structures is a common technique in the design of cryptographic primitives, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the boomerang uniformity of the constructed permutations, which is a measure of their resistance against differential attacks, a topic in symmetric-key cryptography (cs.SD). Finally, the paper mentions the affine equivalence of the constructed permutations to the Gold function, which is a well-known cryptographic primitive, and thus may also be relevant to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
