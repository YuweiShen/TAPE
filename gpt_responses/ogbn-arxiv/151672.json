It also involves optimization techniques, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the use of sinusoidal functions and regularization techniques may also place it under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the experimentation and analysis of results may also make it relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
