The paper also discusses linear-time properties and their robust satisfaction, which is a topic in formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The paper presents computational procedures for constructing robust abstractions, which involves algorithmic and computational aspects of control theory (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the decidable nature of robust control synthesis, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on robustness and control synthesis suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
