The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to implicitly match interest points at detection time suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of this approach for relative pose estimation, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO). The use of CNNs also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates performance relative to state-of-the-art alternatives, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
