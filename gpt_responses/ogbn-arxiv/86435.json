The paper also discusses the impact of turbulence on FSO systems, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes a mode diversity scheme to improve the reliability of FSO systems, which can be considered as a signal processing technique (cs.PH) or a communication theory approach (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
