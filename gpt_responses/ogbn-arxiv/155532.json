The approach combines two levels of abstraction, one inspired by linear optimal feedback control theory and the other by model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel learning framework that combines two levels of abstraction to solve nonlinear control problems. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper presents a method for controlling nonlinear dynamical systems, which is relevant to robotics. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving nonlinear optimal control problems, which falls under the scope of AI. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimal control problems, which is a subfield of systems and control. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper is inspired by neurobiological principles and proposes a hierarchical learning framework, which is relevant to neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
