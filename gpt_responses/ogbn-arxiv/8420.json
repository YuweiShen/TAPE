The approach involves clinicians generating training labels for models defined over a target modality by writing rules over an auxiliary modality. The technical challenge is to estimate the accuracies and correlations of these rules. This paper extends a recent unsupervised generative modeling technique to handle this cross-modal setting in a provably consistent way. The paper presents results from four applications in radiography, computed tomography, and electroencephalography, demonstrating a fundamentally faster and more flexible way of building machine learning models in medicine. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
