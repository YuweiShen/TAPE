The use of neural networks also suggests that the paper may fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the methods to medical imaging data sets suggests that it may also fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
