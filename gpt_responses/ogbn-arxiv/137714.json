This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), cybersecurity (cs.CY), cryptography (cs.CR), and databases (cs.DB). However, given the focus on data citation practices and the use of a citation index, we believe that cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CY, cs.CR, and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
