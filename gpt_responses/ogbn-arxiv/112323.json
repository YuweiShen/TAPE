The addition of a regularization term to the loss function is a technique used in machine learning to improve model performance, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method suggests that it could also fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of limited annotated images, which could involve the use of neural networks (cs.NE) for semi-supervised learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
