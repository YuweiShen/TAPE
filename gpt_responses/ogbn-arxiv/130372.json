The paper uses a labeled dataset of Wikipedia comments and trains a 6-headed machine learning model to classify different types of toxicity. The paper involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in the sub-fields of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of classification algorithms, which are commonly used in the sub-field of cyber security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of enhancing healthy online conversations, which is related to the sub-field of cyber psychology (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
