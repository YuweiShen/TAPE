This involves handling large time series data and requires fast and scalable methods. The paper presents a method based on mutual information to identify correlations at multiple temporal scales in large time series. This involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG), data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), databases (cs.DB), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.DS, cs.IT, cs.DB, and cs.AI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
