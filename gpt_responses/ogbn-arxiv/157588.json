The use of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology and artificial noise injection is also a common technique in the wireless communication (cs.MM) and network security (cs.NI) communities. Finally, the consideration of imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a common issue in many areas of computer science, including wireless communication (cs.MM), network security (cs.NI), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
