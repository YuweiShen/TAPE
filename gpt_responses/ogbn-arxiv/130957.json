The use of graph theory to characterize the feasibility of the proposed scheme suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of social networks (cs.SI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the use of precoding techniques may also make the paper relevant to the subfield of communication and information theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
