However, the use of diffusion-based molecular communication (DbMC) as the communication method indicates that the paper is likely to be related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The iterative method for communication among nodes also suggests that the paper could be related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MA). Finally, the consensus problem and variance reduction in estimates could be related to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
