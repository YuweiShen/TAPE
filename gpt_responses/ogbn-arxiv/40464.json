The focus is on the differentiability of reservoir filters, which is a key feature in the learning of chaotic dynamical systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also provides approximation bounds and links to existing research on the input-dependence of the ESP, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with the characterization of global reservoir system solutions, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
