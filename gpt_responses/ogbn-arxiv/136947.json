The use of over-parameterized neural nets is also a common technique in neural network research (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of piecewise linear activation functions, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence research (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the potential applications of their findings in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
