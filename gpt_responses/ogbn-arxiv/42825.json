This topic falls under the domain of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the impact of fading on EVM, which is a topic of interest in Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper uses special functions to simplify the derived EVM expressions, which is a topic of interest in Mathematics (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
