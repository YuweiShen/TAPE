The paper also discusses the use of a linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) filter, which is a common technique in machine learning and signal processing (cs.LG). The application of the approach to target tracking in clutter involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the use of a feedback control system and state estimator is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
