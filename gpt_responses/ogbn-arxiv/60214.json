Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), which deals with audio and music processing. The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as Doc2vec for representing lyrics, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for cross-modal retrieval, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves multimedia processing, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
