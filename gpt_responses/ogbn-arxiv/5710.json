Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a greedy policy that achieves bounded regret, which involves optimization and decision making, making it relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also discusses the informativeness of the arms, which is related to game theory (cs.GT) and economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
