The paper presents testers with two-sided error and one-sided error in the adjacency list model, which are important tools in the study of property testing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Additionally, the paper also has connections to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as small set expansion has applications in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
