It also involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The focus on accuracy and efficiency suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The experiments conducted on basketball and soccer games suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the mention of camera movements and motion blur suggests that the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
