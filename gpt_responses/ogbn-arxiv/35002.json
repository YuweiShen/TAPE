The paper also discusses machine learning techniques such as Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and softmax-based approaches, which are commonly used in areas such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper analyzes the errors and regularities in self-normalization algorithms, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
