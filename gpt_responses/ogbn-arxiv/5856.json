The presence of an active warden who can tamper with the channel and vary its properties also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the cyber security (cs.CY) sub-category. The use of an adaptive protocol and the characterization of covert secret key capacity may involve machine learning (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) techniques, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
