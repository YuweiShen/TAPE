Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves learning and optimization techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a general form that unifies different normalization methods, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of switchable operations also suggests a potential fit for cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on various benchmarks, including image style transfer, which could place it under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
