The study of online search and reservation price policies suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The investigation of different analysis techniques and their sensitivity to different domains suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
