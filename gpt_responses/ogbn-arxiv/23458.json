Additionally, the paper involves the use of machine learning algorithms to learn data-driven cardiac motion descriptors, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of statistical methods to study the association between motion descriptors and non-imaging data, which suggests that it may belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) or computational epidemiology (cs.CE) sub-categories.
