The use of statistical tests and the a contrario framework also suggests a machine learning (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.LG) approach. Additionally, the proposal of a computational Gestalt model of human perception implies an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) aspect. Finally, the use of visual angle as a parameter suggests a graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
