This involves optimizing the analog beamformer and the number of active RF chains to maximize the sum-rate, and jointly optimizing the digital beamformer based on the instantaneous effective channel information. This work involves aspects of information theory (cs.IT), networking and communications (cs.NI), control and systems engineering (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and augmented reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
