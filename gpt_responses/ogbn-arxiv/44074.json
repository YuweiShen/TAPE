The paper also discusses the use of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique, which is a popular optimization tool in the signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG) fields. The paper's focus on low-complexity and structured beamforming design suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) community, which often deals with resource-constrained systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
