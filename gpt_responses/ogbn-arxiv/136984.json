It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it generates captions in natural language. The use of multi-scale message propagation and attribute grounding suggests that it may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the experiments are conducted on a visual dataset, indicating that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
