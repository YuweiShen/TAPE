This involves the use of varactor diodes and pattern reconfiguration to encode MIMO information onto orthogonal virtual basis patterns in the far field. The paper also includes a measurement campaign to compare the performance of the beam-space MIMO system with a conventional $2\\times 2$ MIMO system under realistic propagation conditions. This work involves aspects of information theory (cs.IT), radio frequency (cs.RF), measurement and analysis (cs.MA), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
