The focus is on identifying influential groups of training samples in test-time predictions, which is related to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
