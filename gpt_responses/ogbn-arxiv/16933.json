The paper also introduces a new problem, the simultaneous partial-inverse problem, which has applications beyond coding theory and may be of interest to researchers in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and computer algebra (cs.CR). The paper also discusses algorithms for solving the problem, which may be of interest to researchers in the field of symbolic computation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
