The paper proposes a matching scheme based on the typicality of the adjacency matrices of the graphs and derives achievability results that provide theoretical guarantees for successful matching under specific assumptions on graph parameters. The paper also considers two scenarios: with side-information and without side-information. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
