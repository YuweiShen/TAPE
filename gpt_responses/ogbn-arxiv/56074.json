The paper also involves the study of capacity and coding schemes for noisy channels, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of interactive hashing and the formulation of multiple simultaneous OTs suggest a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the study of capacity bounds and optimization techniques is related to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
