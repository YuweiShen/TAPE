This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as it involves developing methods for robots to perceive and recognize objects through sensory inputs. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of clustering and codebooks, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI). The development and validation of hybrid fusion strategies also suggests a focus on machine learning and decision-making (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for enhancing robot perception ability, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
