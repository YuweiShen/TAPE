The paper also emphasizes the need for transparency and situational awareness, which are key topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The integration and validation of remote AIS solutions with existing and future offshore energy assets and sensors involves system-level control and coordination, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of sensors and the need for autonomous systems to operate in complex and cluttered environments, which are topics in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
