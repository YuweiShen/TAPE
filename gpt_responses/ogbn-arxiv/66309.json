The use of skip graphs is a novel approach to improving NUMA locality, which is a concern in distributed systems and operating systems. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the implementation of skip graphs in concurrent data structures, which falls under cs.OS (Operating Systems). Additionally, the paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of map and priority queue ADTs, which is related to cs.AR (Architecture) and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
