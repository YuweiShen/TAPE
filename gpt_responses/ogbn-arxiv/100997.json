The paper also discusses the use of cascade training and network trimming, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on benchmark image datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
