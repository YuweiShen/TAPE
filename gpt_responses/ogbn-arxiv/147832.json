The use of semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies is a common technique in approximation algorithms, which suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are likely sub-categories. The problems studied in the paper involve graphs and cuts, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as another possible sub-category. The paper also deals with approximation ratios and integrality gaps, which are topics in optimization and combinatorial mathematics, respectively, suggesting cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as additional possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
