Additionally, the use of semantic segmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The application of the proposed method in autonomous driving also suggests that it may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques and the focus on improving detection performance suggests that it may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
