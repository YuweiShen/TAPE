The paper discusses the practical implementation of a repair layering framework called DoubleR, which is designed to minimize cross-rack repair traffic. This topic is closely related to distributed computing (cs.DC), information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), network infrastructure (cs.NI), and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
