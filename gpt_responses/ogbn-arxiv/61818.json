The paper proposes an algorithm and proves a data-dependent regret bound against any set of policies based on an arbitrary halting criterion and decision rule. The problem involves sequential decision making, and the algorithm borrows ideas from multiarmed bandits. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem also involves statistical analysis, so cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
