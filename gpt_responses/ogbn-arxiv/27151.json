Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as model ensemble and self-training, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) tasks such as text classification, which makes cs.IR a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper uses early-stopping to improve performance, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning and could make cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a relevant sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
