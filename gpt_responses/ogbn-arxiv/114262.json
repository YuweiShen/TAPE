The use of reachability maps and manipulation tasks suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the library's performance also suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
