Specifically, the paper proposes a non-Hilbertian quantum-like model to explain certain cognitive phenomena, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the need for a consistent framework to deal with response replicability and unpacking effects, which could be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents experimental results to support its model, which could be of interest to social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
