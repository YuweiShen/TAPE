The paper also mentions computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as related fields. The use of computational tools to implement these ideas suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the focus on perception systems suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
