The paper also proposes a novel technique for reducing the parameters in fully connected layers, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses machine learning techniques to solve the problem of handwritten character recognition (cs.AI). The paper also uses a dataset for offline handwritten character recognition, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing in the context of character recognition, which is a common topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
