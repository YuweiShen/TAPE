This is a core topic in information theory, making cs.IT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the effect of system parameters on information measures, which is a topic related to systems and control. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Information theory is a fundamental concept in machine learning, and the paper's focus on mutual information and its gradient could be relevant to machine learning applications.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper's focus on information measures could be relevant to multimedia applications such as image and video compression.\n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper's discussion of communication channels with feedback could be relevant to networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
