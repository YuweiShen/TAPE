Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses regularization techniques for word embeddings, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning, cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of word embeddings for text classification and similarity measures also relates to information retrieval, cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and artificial intelligence, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the use of word embeddings for semantic text similarity, which can be related to computer vision, cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
