The paper specifically focuses on reducing communication overhead in distributed training, which is a common problem in distributed systems. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
