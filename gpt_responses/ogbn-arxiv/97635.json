This makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions applications such as hyperspectral image classification and ImageNet classification, which are related to Computer Vision (cs.CV). The proposed solution is based on linear programming, which falls under the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with multi-class problems, which are often addressed using Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
