The paper also discusses the size and delay of the automata, which are related to topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents a novel hierarchical automata construction, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
