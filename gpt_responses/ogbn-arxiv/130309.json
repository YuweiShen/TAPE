The use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for optimization also suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of parallelized $1\\times 1$ CNNs, called Network in Network, suggests a potential fit for the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
