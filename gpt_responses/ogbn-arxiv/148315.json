The paper proposes a new technique that is informed by the known hierarchical structure of the human body kinematic structure, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments on standard benchmark datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new design that outperforms several existing and popular methods, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
