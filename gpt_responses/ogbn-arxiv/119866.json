This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper discusses applications such as interactive image editing and data-driven image manipulation, which are relevant to multimedia (cs.MM).
