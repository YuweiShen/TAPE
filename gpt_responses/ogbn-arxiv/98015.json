However, the focus is on the organizational stakeholders and individual researchers involved in computational research, which suggests a strong connection to the category of Computer and Society (cs.CY). The paper also mentions the need for documentation and training, which is related to the category of Digital Libraries (cs.DL). The discussion of system-level tools and modeling best practices suggests a connection to Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), respectively. Finally, the mention of gateways and related technologies suggests a connection to Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
