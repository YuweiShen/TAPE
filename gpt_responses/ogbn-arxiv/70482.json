The use of quantized message passing suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The analysis of convergence of distributed algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) or Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. The proposed quantizer designs and their tradeoff analysis suggest that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
