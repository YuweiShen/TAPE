The proposed method aims to reduce network complexity and improve performance, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experimental results involve video data, indicating a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of neural networks suggests a possible connection to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
