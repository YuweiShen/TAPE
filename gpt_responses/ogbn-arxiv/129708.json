The use of dynamic programming algorithms also suggests a possible connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The mention of updating beliefs and expected utility suggests a possible connection to control systems (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
