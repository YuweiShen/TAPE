This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also addresses the problem of secure transmission in the presence of eavesdroppers, which is a common concern in the field of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relays and artificial noise (AN) also suggests a focus on system design and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves simulation results, which may fall under multimedia (cs.MM) if visualizations or other media are used to present the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
