This falls under the area of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also uses tools from computational geometry (cs.CG) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) to develop their fixed-parameter algorithm. The paper also mentions the use of monadic second-order formulas (cs.DL) and the study of systems and control theory (cs.SY) in related work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
