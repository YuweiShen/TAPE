The paper proposes an approach for calibrating temporal offset between visual and inertial measurements, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and optimization (cs.LG). The approach is also applicable to feature-based optimization frameworks, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper demonstrates the high accuracy of the proposed approach, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
