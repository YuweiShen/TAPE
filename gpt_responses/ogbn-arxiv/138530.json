Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of a display calculus for focused proof search, which falls under the sub-category of logical reasoning and proof search (cs.LG). The adaptation of Girard's polarity-sensitive double negation embedding for classical logic suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also provides linguistic motivation for linear distributivity, which is relevant to formal language theory (cs.FL) and programming language theory (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
