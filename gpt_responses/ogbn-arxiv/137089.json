The paper also involves the study of cyclotomic sets and their properties, which is related to number theory (cs.NT) and information theory (cs.IT). The determination of lower bounds on the complexity of sequences is a problem in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the application of the results to resist attacks on feedback with carry shift registers (FCSRs) involves the study of system security (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
