The paper also discusses convergence analysis and optimization, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper mentions locomotion benchmarks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
