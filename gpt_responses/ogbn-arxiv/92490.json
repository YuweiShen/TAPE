The paper specifically focuses on improving one-shot NAS, which involves training a single \"supernet\" that contains all possible architectures and then selecting the best architecture based on its performance within the supernet. Given that the paper uses image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, it is likely to fall under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for improving one-shot NAS, which involves optimizing the supernet in a way that balances the updates for large and small architectures. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves training neural networks, which falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves optimizing the architecture of neural networks, which falls under the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
