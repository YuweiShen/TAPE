The paper uses concepts from graph theory, such as expansion, to derive lower bounds on the cell probe complexity of nearest neighbor search algorithms. This makes it likely that the paper would be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also uses concepts from information theory, such as communication complexity, which makes it likely to be classified under cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the relationship between expansion and lower bounds on the size of data structures, which makes it likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
