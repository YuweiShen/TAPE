The paper deals with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, specifically Named Entities (NEs), which are a common topic in the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The use of neural methods and learned word embeddings suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the proposed method on structured Question-Answering, Goal-Oriented dialog, and Reading-Comprehension tasks suggests a connection to Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the creation of extended versions of dialog bAbI tasks and OOV versions of the CBT test set suggests a connection to Named Entity Recognition (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
