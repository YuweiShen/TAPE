This involves learning the attention scores of user and item history in an interacting way to account for the dependencies between user and item dynamics in shaping user-item interactions. This work is therefore likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
