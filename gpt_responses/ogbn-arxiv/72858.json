This makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new performance metric for ordinal classification, which could also place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of deep networks and the evaluation on benchmark datasets suggest that it could also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
