The paper proposes a new algorithm that is parameter-free and adaptive to an unknown range of noise and local smoothness. This makes it relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
