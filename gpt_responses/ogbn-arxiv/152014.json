This problem falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO). The proposed method uses graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to parametrize policies for the robots, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also mentions simulations, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) if the simulations involve visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
