The model combines prior knowledge from knowledge bases with context information to improve PPI extraction. This work involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, which are commonly found in the computer science sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of knowledge bases also suggests a potential fit for information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
