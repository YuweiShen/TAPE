This falls under the domain of distributed computing, which is a sub-category of cs.DC. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the inherent problem of transaction-processing bottleneck in prevalent blockchain networks built upon the proof-of-work consensus protocol. This involves cryptography and security aspects of blockchain networks, which is a sub-category of cs.CR. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the protocol design of sharded consensus, which enables parallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of processors. This involves networking and internet architecture aspects of blockchain networks, which is a sub-category of cs.NI. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper models the evolution of blockchain selection by the individual processors as an evolutionary game. This involves social and information network aspects of blockchain networks, which is a sub-category of cs.SI. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper uses evolutionary game theory to model the dynamics of blockchain-selection in the condition of a large population of consensus processors. This falls under the domain of game theory, which is a sub-category of cs.GT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
