This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new mechanism for collaboration, which could also place it in the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The use of automatic propagation of code changes and restriction of concurrent editing suggests a potential fit with the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the benefits of real-time awareness of new code, which could place it in the Software Development (cs.SD) sub-category. Finally, the use of a prototype to demonstrate key features suggests a potential fit with the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
