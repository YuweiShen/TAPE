The use of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology and the consideration of multiple channels per hop suggest that this paper may also fall under the categories of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SY). The specific focus on mm-wave networks and the use of analytical expressions for end-to-end latency make the category of multimedia (cs.MM) a possibility as well. Finally, the use of queuing theory and the consideration of network performance suggest that the category of performance analysis (cs.PF) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
