This involves computer vision techniques such as segmentation and detection, which are commonly used in the field of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms for training and validation of the models, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors have used an interactive semi-automatic tool for annotation of the data set, which involves human-computer interaction and could be classified under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also involves the use of statistical measures such as precision and recall rates, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the application of these techniques for investigating economic and urban growth, which could be classified under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
