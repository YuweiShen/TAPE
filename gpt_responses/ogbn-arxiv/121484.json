It could also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves text processing. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with finding and correlating shared semantics in image and text. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) are also possible sub-categories as the paper proposes a novel neural network architecture for image-text matching."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
