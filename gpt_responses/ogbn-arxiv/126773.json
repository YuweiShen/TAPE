The primary focus is on improving the edge structure of the detected salient objects. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of non-local features and edge prior knowledge, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of deep learning models, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
