The paper presents results on the computation of the value of these games under finite-memory strategies for player 1. This is a natural fit for the Game Theory category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem of computing the set of states with value 1 under finite-memory strategies for player 1. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms category.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with the computation of long-run average payoffs in concurrent games, which involves temporal logic and other logical concepts. This makes the paper relevant to the Logic in Computer Science category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the computation of optimal strategies for player 1 in concurrent games, which is a central problem in AI. This makes the paper relevant to the Artificial Intelligence category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper presents results on the complexity of stationary strategies in concurrent games, which involves programming language concepts such as distributions and complexity measures. This makes the paper relevant to the Programming Languages category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
