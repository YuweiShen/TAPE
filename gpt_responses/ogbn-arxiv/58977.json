This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel framework that uses expectation-maximization (EM) to mine weakly supervised labels in electronic medical records (EMRs), which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of 3D ConvNets for medical image analysis also falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval from EMRs, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
