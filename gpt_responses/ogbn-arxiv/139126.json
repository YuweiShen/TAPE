The experiment involves connecting Coq, another proof assistant, to the PIDE infrastructure, which involves software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL) aspects. The paper also mentions the implementation of the PIDE protocol layer in OCaml, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for other provers to participate in PIDE, which falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
