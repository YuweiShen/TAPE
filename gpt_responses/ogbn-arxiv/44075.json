The use of typical sets and entropy inequalities also points towards cs.NI and cs.SI. The paper also mentions the blowing-up lemma, which is commonly used in computational complexity theory, making cs.CC a possible category. Finally, the application of the results to a specific case involving binary channels suggests cs.MM as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
