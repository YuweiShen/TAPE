This falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with classification tasks (cs.AI) and image processing (cs.CV) as it tests the proposed approach on benchmark datasets. Additionally, the use of optimization algorithms for architecture determination can be related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
