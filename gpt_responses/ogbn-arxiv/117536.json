This is a topic that falls under the scope of programming languages.\n3. cs.TL (Theoretical Computer Science) - The paper discusses the time-complexity semantics for ATR and shows that the new recursion schemes do not lead out of the realm of feasibility. This is a topic that falls under the scope of theoretical computer science.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses a type system for ATR programs that run in type-2 polynomial-time, which is a topic that falls under the scope of computational complexity.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the ability of the revised ATR to express classic insertion- and selection-sort algorithms, which is a topic that falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
