This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NT) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of EXIT curves, which are commonly used in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also discusses empirical evidence, which suggests that it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
