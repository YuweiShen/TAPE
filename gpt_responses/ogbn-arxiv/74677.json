The paper also discusses the use of LED technology in VLC systems, which falls under the category of optics and photonics (OH). The paper also involves the use of experimental robotics (RO) to demonstrate the effect of LED DC bias on the performance of VLC systems. Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the DC bias point of the LED, which involves the use of control systems (SY) concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
