It also involves communication networks and information theory, as the sensors exchange information through inter-sensor communications (cs.IT). The paper uses mathematical tools such as random dynamical systems and large deviation theory, which are common in applied mathematics (cs.MA). The paper also deals with potentially unstable and large systems, which are common in the field of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the convergence of the distributed scheme to the centralized performance, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
