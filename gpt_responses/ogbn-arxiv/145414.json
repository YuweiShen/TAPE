The paper discusses the effectiveness of different types of annotations for this task, which suggests that it belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of in-the-wild images, which suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper discusses the trade-off between cost and effectiveness, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of dense correspondence, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
