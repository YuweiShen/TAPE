The proposed architecture involves using group convolutions to reduce complexity and improve efficiency, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of multi-branch methods, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed architecture on several large-scale datasets, which is a common practice in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
