Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for dense motion estimation, which involves the use of skeletal flow and upgrading sparse flow to dense flow. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also claims to have better performance compared to state of the art and neural network approaches, indicating that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
