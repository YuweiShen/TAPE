The use of sampling theory and constructions of smaller-size approximations suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the different notions of sampling, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
