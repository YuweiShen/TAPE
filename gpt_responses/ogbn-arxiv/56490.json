The paper also proposes a practical method for iterative design, which involves training policies using policy gradient algorithms, and characterizing policies via sets of Deterministic Action Stochastic State (DASS) tuples. This methodology involves machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the successful transfer of policies learned in simulation to the physical robot, which involves system integration (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which involves performance evaluation and optimization, falling under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
