This framework is applicable to several online learning problems where the environment changes over time. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
