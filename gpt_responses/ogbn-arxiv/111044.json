Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses machine learning models and their robustness, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses attacks on models, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security).
