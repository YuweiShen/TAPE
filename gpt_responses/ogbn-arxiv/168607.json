The paper discusses the computational challenges of the classic model and proposes a deep learning-based solution that uses efficient parallel sampling processes. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning-based solution for a statistical model, which involves training neural networks to learn the correlation structure of binary responses. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an end-to-end learning scheme for a statistical model, which involves training neural networks to learn the correlation structure of binary responses. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a solution for a classic statistical model, the multivariate probit model, which involves learning the correlation structure of binary responses. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the application of the proposed model to multi-entity modelling problems, which are common in social and information networks. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the convergence behavior of the proposed model's sampling process, which involves integrating over a multidimensional constrained space of latent variables, and provides convergence guarantees."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
