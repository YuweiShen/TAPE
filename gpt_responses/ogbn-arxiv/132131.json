The paper also proposes a novel multitask framework for joint lesion detection, tagging, and segmentation, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of large datasets (cs.MM) and the use of information retrieval techniques (cs.IR) to improve the accuracy of lesion detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
