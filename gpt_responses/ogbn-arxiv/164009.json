The paper proposes an Anonymous MARL (AyMARL) model and employs the principle of maximum entropy to provide a general framework of independent learning that is both empirically effective and theoretically justified. The paper also provides significant improvements in revenue and fairness over existing approaches. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
