It also involves analyzing the performance of communication systems (cs.COMM) in terms of diversity and multiplexing tradeoff. The use of perfect receive channel state information (CSI) is a common technique in wireless networks (cs.NI), and the paper discusses the impact of interference on the achievable tradeoff (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions a specific coding scheme (Han and Kobayashi) which is commonly used in multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
