The use of probabilistic models and the analysis of their robustness also suggest a connection to data science (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of analytic results and bounds on the impact of parameter changes suggests a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
