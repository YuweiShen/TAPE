The paper proposes a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora, which involves techniques from information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DL). The main application of the proposed method is in statistical machine translation, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.IR, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
