The approach involves reusing models and adapting their weights based on performance. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), and software engineering (cs.SE). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
