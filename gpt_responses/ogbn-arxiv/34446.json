Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of numerical simulations, which suggests a possible fit with cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
