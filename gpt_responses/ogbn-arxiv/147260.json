The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the system, which could place it in the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the system involves the use of sensors and algorithms to handle practical deployment issues, which could place it in the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of Voronoi tessellation, which is a topic that falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper includes an evaluation of the system's performance using image processing techniques, which could place it in the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
