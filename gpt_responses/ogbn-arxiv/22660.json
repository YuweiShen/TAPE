The use of tight frames is a popular approach in this area, and the paper proposes two algorithms, analysis Dantzig selector and analysis LASSO, for sparse recovery with coherent tight frames. These algorithms are based on the restricted isometry property adapted to a tight frame, which is a natural extension to the standard restricted isometry property. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SP (Signal Processing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
