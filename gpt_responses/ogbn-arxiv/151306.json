The paper also mentions the use of a quality metric to forward search requests, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of entropy-based metrics could also relate to data structures (cs.DS). The paper discusses the benefits of distributed learning, which could fall under social and information networks (cs.SI).
