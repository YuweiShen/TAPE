The paper presents an algorithm to compute a set of loops from a point data that presumably sample a smooth manifold, which is a problem related to computational geometry.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents an algorithm to compute a shortest basis of the one dimensional homology group over coefficients in finite field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ from point data. This problem is related to data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The problem of computing a shortest basis of $H_1(K)$ for any finite simplicial complex $K$ whose edges have non-negative weights is related to game theory and optimization.\n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper presents a polynomial time algorithm for computing a shortest basis of $H_1(K)$ for any finite simplicial complex $K$ whose edges have non-negative weights.
