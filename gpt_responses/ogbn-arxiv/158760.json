This paper proposes a resource allocation policy for Fog computing, which falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Fog computing is closely related to networking and internet architecture, as it involves processing data at the edge of the network. The proposed policy considers device heterogeneity, resource constraint, and mobility, which are important networking and internet architecture-related characteristics.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed policy aims to minimise overall delay, processing time, and SLA violation, which are system-related metrics. The use of multiple objective functions to find appropriate resources for execution of time-sensitive tasks also falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Fog computing involves the development of software systems that can process data at the edge of the network. The proposed policy is a software engineering solution that addresses dynamic changes in user behaviour in a resource-limited Fog device.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed policy involves the allocation of computational resources in a Fog computing environment, which falls under the scope of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
