This involves information theory concepts such as channel coding and modulation schemes. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with communication systems and proposes a design that does not interfere with existing OFDM communication systems. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a design for ambient backscatter communication systems and discusses signal detection at the reader. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a transceiver design for ambient backscatter communication systems, which involves control of the transmitted and received signals. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of cyclic prefix in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) source symbols, which is a technique used in multimedia communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
