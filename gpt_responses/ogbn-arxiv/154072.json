The algorithm is based on corner solution search, which involves identifying the boundaries of Pareto fronts. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the development and application of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are relevant to the proposed algorithm.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers a wide range of topics related to AI, including optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm could be considered as an AI-based optimization algorithm.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category focuses on the development and application of machine learning algorithms, which could be relevant to the proposed algorithm.\n- cs.DM (Data Mining): This sub-category deals with the extraction of useful information from large datasets, which could be relevant to the optimization problems addressed in the paper.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers topics related to the modeling, analysis, and control of complex systems, which could be relevant to the real-world engineering optimization problems addressed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
