The paper discusses the integration of these components into an IoT-based industrial automation environment, which is a common application area for robotics. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a software layer (IoTwrapper) to convert conventional mechatronic components to an IoT-compliant interface. This involves software engineering techniques such as modeling, transformation, and implementation. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): IoT and Industry 4.0 are considered emerging technologies that are transforming the manufacturing industry. The paper discusses the integration of mechatronic components into an IoT-based industrial automation environment, which is an example of an emerging technology application. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the integration of mechatronic components into an IoT-based industrial automation environment, which involves control systems to ensure the components work together effectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
