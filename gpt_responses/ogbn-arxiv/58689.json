The paper presents tight bounds on the number of blanks when the pieces must be connected, convex or rectangular, which are all topics in computational geometry.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The problem involves finding an optimal way to cut a cake, which can be seen as an algorithmic problem. The paper presents algorithms to solve the problem and analyzes their time complexity.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The problem involves partitioning a set of objects (toppings) into subsets (pieces) with certain constraints (no overlapping toppings in a piece). This is a classic problem in discrete mathematics.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The problem involves minimizing the number of blanks, which can be seen as a game between the cutter and the toppings. The paper presents a game-theoretic analysis of the problem.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The problem involves finding an optimal way to cut a cake, which can be seen as a computational complexity problem. The paper presents complexity results for the problem and shows that it is NP-hard in some cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
