The proposed solution involves a deep learning model (cs.LG) that uses a novel tensor factorization technique (cs.AI) to improve the performance of fourth-order Boltzmann machines. The problem of trajectory estimation also has applications in robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
