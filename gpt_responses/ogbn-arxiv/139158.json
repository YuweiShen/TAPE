It may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as these fields are closely related to computer vision. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of GPUs for computation, which may place it in the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category.
