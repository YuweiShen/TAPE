Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of a specific algorithm (YOLO v2) and extends its loss function, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with real-time performance, which could place it in cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
