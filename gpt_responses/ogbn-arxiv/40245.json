This involves compressive system identification, which is a topic in control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also uses compressed sensing to reconstruct the associated full-state dynamic modes, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper deals with nonlinear dynamical systems, which is a topic in dynamical systems (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also uses Gaussian random projections, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
