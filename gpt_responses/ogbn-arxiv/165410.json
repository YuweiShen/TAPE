Therefore, the most likely category is cs.GT (Game Theory and Economics). The paper also discusses the reasoning of players, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which deals with intelligent agents and their decision-making processes. The paper also presents an axiomatic presentation, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science).
