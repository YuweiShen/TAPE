The paper also discusses the technical details of the analysis system, which is related to programming language theory. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses linear optimization to derive worst-case resource bounds, which is a technique related to mathematical optimization and linear programming. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the practicality of the analysis system and demonstrates its implementation and integration with Inria's OCaml compiler. The paper also presents a case study on inferring bounds on the number of queries sent by OCaml programs to a commercial NoSQL cloud database service, which is related to software engineering. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions that the analysis system can handle implementations of textbook algorithms and derives resource bounds for them. This is related to the field of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the expressivity and efficiency of the analysis system, which is related to formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
