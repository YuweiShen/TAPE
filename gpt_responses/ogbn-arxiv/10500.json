This suggests that the paper would likely fall under the categories of data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DL). However, given the focus on geometric problems and linear functions, cs.CG and cs.DM may be more likely than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
