The paper focuses on regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning to improve model performance. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of explanation systems and metrics, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
