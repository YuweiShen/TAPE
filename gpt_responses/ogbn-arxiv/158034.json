The paper presents novel algorithms for solving the VNEP, which is a problem of interest to the networking community. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents fixed-parameter tractable approximation algorithms for the VNEP, which involves designing efficient algorithms for solving a complex optimization problem. \n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper introduces the graph-theoretic notion of extraction orders and extraction width, which are used to capture the structure of request graphs. This involves studying combinatorial properties of graphs, which is a topic of interest in discrete mathematics. \n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper presents a linear program formulation for the VNEP, which involves designing a mechanism for allocating resources to different request graphs. This can be seen as a game-theoretic problem of designing a fair allocation mechanism. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper shows that computing extraction orders of minimal width and computing decomposable LP solutions are both NP-hard problems. This involves studying the computational complexity of optimization problems, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
