The study also involves human perception, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of deep net embedding suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the study involves security and privacy concerns, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
