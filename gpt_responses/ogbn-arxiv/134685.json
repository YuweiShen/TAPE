The focus on spanning trees and degree constraints suggests that cs.DS and cs.DM are the most likely categories, while the use of Lagrangian duality and other optimization techniques may also make cs.CG and cs.GT relevant. Finally, the mention of approximation algorithms and cost bounds suggests that cs.LG may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
