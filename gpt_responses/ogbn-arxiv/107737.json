The paper also proposes a new approach for combining the outputs of multiple classifiers, which involves the use of mixture functions and dynamic weights. This topic is relevant to the sub-categories of \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on various classification datasets, which falls under the sub-category of \"cs.DM\" (Data Mining). Finally, the paper mentions the use of classifier ensembles in computer vision applications, which is relevant to the sub-category of \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
