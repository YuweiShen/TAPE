This involves addressing the issue of interference among coordinates in optimization routines that rely on smoothness properties. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
