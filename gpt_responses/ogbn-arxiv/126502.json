The optimization problem formulation and constraints on individual probability of rate outage and power budget suggest that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of weighted sum rate and max-min-fairness rate as system utilities indicates that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
