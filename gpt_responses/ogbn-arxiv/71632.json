It involves the use of unsupervised learning-based algorithms for detecting patterns in access logs and extracting ABAC authorization rules from these patterns. This paper is likely to belong to the categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning) due to the use of machine learning algorithms for policy extraction. It may also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) due to the focus on policy development and the use of algorithms for policy improvement."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
