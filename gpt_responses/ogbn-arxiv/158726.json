Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed model in terms of quality degradation, which is a common evaluation metric in NLP. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques such as attention mechanisms and parallelization, which are relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE).
