It also involves machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which fall under the categories of statistical learning (cs.LG) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SD (Sound), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.MM (Multimedia).
