Additionally, the paper introduces a new representational format for analyzing tasks, which is relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the advantages of using neural models over symbolic artificial intelligence production systems, which is relevant to the Cognitive Psychology (cs.COG) sub-category.
