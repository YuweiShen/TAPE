This involves modeling partial or incomplete responses using belief functions and deriving a measure that characterizes the expertise level of each participant based on precision and exactitude degrees. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for the modeling aspect, human-computer interaction (cs.HC) for the crowdsourcing platform aspect, social and information networks (cs.SI) for the analysis of participant behavior, cybersecurity (cs.CY) for the potential applications in identifying malicious actors, and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) for the simulation aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
