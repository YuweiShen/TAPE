These tasks involve understanding the spatial structure and semantics of documents, which are typically represented as 2D grids. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of BERT language model and fully convolutional network suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
