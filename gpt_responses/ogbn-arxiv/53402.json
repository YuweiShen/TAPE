The paper also provides detailed algorithms and proofs to guarantee the correctness of the approximations, which is related to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The perturbation analysis method used in the paper is a common technique in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with real numbers and their operations, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
