This involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for gathering and analyzing data from various sources, such as social media and online shops. It also involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques for detecting influencers and predicting trends. Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of large datasets and the need to handle multiple languages and cultural differences, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.SI and cs.CY.
