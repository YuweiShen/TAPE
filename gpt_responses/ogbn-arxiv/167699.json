The paper proposes two asynchronous cooperative diversity schemes, which involve the use of space-time codes and distributed delay diversity, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing, which is a fundamental concept in information theory and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
