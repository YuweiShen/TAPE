The paper also discusses the need for security in embedded systems, which is a major concern in the field of cryptography and security. \n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the use of Handel-C, a high-level hardware description language, for the development of the hardware design. This language is specifically designed for software engineers who are not familiar with hardware design, making it relevant to the software engineering field. \n3. cs.AR (Architecture) - The paper discusses the development of a hardware design for KATAN and KATANTAN ciphers, which involves designing the architecture of the system. \n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the use of Handel-C, a programming language specifically designed for hardware design, making it relevant to the programming languages field. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the development of a parallel-pipelined hybrid implementation of the hardware design, which involves parallel computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
