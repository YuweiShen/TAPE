Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also proposes a framework for developing a vision-based tool, which involves computer vision techniques, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another likely category. The study also involves analyzing data and developing a tool for personalized training and safety management, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of hazard recognition and safety management, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
