The paper also involves the use of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and modification of character-based posteriors, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of beam search decoding, which is a common technique in natural language processing and falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
