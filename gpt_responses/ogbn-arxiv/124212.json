The approach involves modeling relations in high dimensional space, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also explicitly models the graph context, which is a key aspect of natural language processing (cs.CL) and database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
