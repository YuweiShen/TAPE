Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely category. The paper also involves Boolean functions and their optimization, which falls under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of mutual information and probability theory suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as another possible category. Finally, the paper deals with communication channels and their properties, which could also fit under cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
