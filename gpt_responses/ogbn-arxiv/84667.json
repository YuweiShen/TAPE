It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as understanding road scenes is important for autonomous driving. The use of a neural network for semantic segmentation suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of stereo images and disparity maps suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
