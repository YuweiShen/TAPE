The proposed algorithm, Hash-Mark-Set (HMS), also involves creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the pending transaction pool, which is a common technique in distributed computing. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the blockchain consensus mechanism and the need for correctness in smart contract transactions, which are related to security concerns. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the isolation level of smart contract transactions and proposes a new algorithm to improve transaction throughput, which are related to database management. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the issues that application programmers face when working with smart contract transactions and proposes a new technique, Runtime Argument Augmentation (RAA), that allows smart contracts to communicate with external data services before submitting a transaction. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new algorithm, Hash-Mark-Set (HMS), to improve transaction throughput and provides an implementation that is interoperable with Ethereum and ready for use in smart contracts, which are related to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
