The paper proposes a new model called Latent State Tracking Network (LSTN) that learns an interpretable model in an unsupervised manner. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing, which is the main focus of this paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent agents, which is relevant to the development of dialog systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of machine learning algorithms, which is the main technique used in this paper. \n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category deals with the processing of sound, which may be relevant to the development of speech-based dialog systems. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the development of neural networks, which is the main technique used in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
