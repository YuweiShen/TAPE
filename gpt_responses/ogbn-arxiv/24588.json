Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also involves fine-tuning BERT, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The use of IR techniques suggests a possible connection to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper mentions experimental results and gains in effectiveness, which could be related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
