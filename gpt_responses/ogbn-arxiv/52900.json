The paper also discusses optimization methods and algorithms for efficient calculations, which are relevant to the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DS). The exploration experiments for two model codes also suggest that the paper may fall under the sub-categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
