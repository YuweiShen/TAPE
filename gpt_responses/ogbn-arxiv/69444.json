The use of distributed control algorithms and communication between neighboring DGs suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The study of voltage source inverters and networks also relates to electrical engineering and systems (cs.ET). Finally, the application of the proposed model on a microgrid involves software engineering and programming (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
