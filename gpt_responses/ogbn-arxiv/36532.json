The proposed method also uses deep learning (LG) models to learn non-linear representations and time-warping techniques. Additionally, the paper uses a publicly available dataset (MM) of in-the-wild speech recordings, and the synthesis of facial motion is relevant to the field of speech recognition (CL) and speech processing (SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
