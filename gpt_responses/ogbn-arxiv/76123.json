It also involves the use of audio and video signals for prediction, which could fall under the Signal Processing (cs.SD) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) categories. Additionally, the use of neural networks for learning and prediction could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories, but these are less likely given the focus on multimedia and sensory effects. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing to some extent, as it discusses the use of declarative authoring languages, which could fall under the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
