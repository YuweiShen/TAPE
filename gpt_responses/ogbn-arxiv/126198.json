The paper focuses on two sports, swimming and long jump, and presents techniques for determining cycle speeds, temporally striking poses, and cycle stability for swimming, and partitioning pose sequences into respective phases for long jump. These techniques involve the use of deep neural networks and unsupervised learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
