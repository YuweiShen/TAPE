This falls under the category of data structures and algorithms, which is covered by cs.DS. The paper also discusses worst-case time complexity and experimental results, which are topics covered by cs.CC (computational complexity) and cs.DM (discrete mathematics). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of global data structures such as the suffix array, which is a topic covered by cs.FL (formal languages and automata theory) and cs.GT (computational geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
