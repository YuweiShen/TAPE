The use of linear programming also suggests it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The focus on residual networks with ReLU activation suggests it could also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of geometrically motivated methods could suggest it belongs to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the empirical demonstration of improved training capacity suggests it could also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
