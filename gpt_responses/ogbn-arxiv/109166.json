This involves joint device scheduling and status sampling, which is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The problem is stochastic and involves non-uniform sizes of status updates under noisy channels. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.MA), and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
