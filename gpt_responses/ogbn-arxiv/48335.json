These problems are related to coding theory and lattice-based cryptography, which are topics that fall under several sub-categories of computer science. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
