The paper also makes use of recent theoretical advances in high-dimensional sketching and indexing. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DB (Databases), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also discusses theoretical and empirical results, which suggest that it may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
