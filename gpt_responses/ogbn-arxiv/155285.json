Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves networked systems and wireless communication, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of multiple antennas and processing techniques could also place the paper in cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
