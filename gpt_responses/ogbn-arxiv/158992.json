Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also focuses on video on demand (VOD) servers and traffic control, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the overall system performance and load balancing, which are relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper emphasizes the need for cost-effective service, which is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
