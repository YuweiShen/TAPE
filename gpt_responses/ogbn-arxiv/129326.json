The use of polynomial interpolation and linear algebraic techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) and Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the advantages of the proposed algorithm for unique decoding in the presence of side information, which could be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
