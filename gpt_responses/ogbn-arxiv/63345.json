The paper proposes algorithms for query rewriting, which involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The problem of finding good query rewrites is shown to be NP-hard, which is a typical result in theoretical computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on large-scale data, which is a common practice in machine learning and data mining (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
