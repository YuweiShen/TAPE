The paper also uses mathematical statistical derivations to prove its point, which suggests that it could also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) category. The numerical simulations mentioned in the paper suggest that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories.
