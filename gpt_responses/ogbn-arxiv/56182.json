This is a common goal in artificial intelligence research. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses memory constraints on the total size of the embeddings, which is a common concern in data structures and algorithms research. \n- cs.SD (Software Development): This category is less likely, but the paper does propose a new method for embedding graphs, which could be considered a software development task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
