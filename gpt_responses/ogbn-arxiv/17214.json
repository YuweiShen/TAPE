This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The energy consumption of instructions is closely related to the performance of the GPU, as it affects the overall power consumption and efficiency. Therefore, this paper could also be categorized under cs.PF.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper uses three different software techniques to read the GPU on-chip power sensors, which use NVIDIA's NVML API, and verifies the software measurement techniques against a custom-designed hardware power measurement. This involves system-level control and measurement, which could fall under cs.SY.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): GPUs are an emerging technology that has gained significant popularity in recent years, and this paper provides insights into the microarchitecture and energy consumption of modern NVIDIA GPUs. Therefore, it could also be categorized under cs.ET.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): GPUs are often used for parallel computing, and this paper provides insights into the energy consumption of various instructions in GPUs, which could be useful for optimizing parallel computing workloads. Therefore, it could also be categorized under cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
