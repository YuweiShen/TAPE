The paper also discusses the use of depth supervised learning, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed method involves the use of deep learning techniques, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the security implications of face recognition systems, which falls under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the collection of a new dataset, which involves human subjects and falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
