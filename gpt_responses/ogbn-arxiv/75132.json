Therefore, cs.IR and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of loss functions and regularization, which are common topics in ML, suggesting cs.CL as a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of document lists, which are commonly used in computer vision (CV) and data structures (DS), suggesting these as possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
