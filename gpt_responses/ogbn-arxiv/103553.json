The paper also introduces a novel approach to conditional random fields (CRF) using deep class embedding, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The dataset used in the experiments is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
