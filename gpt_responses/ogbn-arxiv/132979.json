This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of beam alignment in millimeter-wave communications, which is a key challenge in the design of outdoor wireless networks. This makes it relevant to the networking and internet architecture sub-category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed algorithm involves a two-stage search process that involves exploring and eliminating candidate beam pairs. This can be seen as a control problem, where the goal is to optimize the alignment of transmitter and receiver beams.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of beam alignment in millimeter-wave communications, which is a key technology for high-speed multimedia applications such as video streaming and virtual reality.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): While the paper does not directly deal with natural language processing, it does involve the use of optimization techniques and mathematical analysis, which are relevant to the computation and language sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
