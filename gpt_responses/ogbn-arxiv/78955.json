The package allows researchers to generate a visual interface for their ML models, which can be easily shared and tested by non-technical collaborators and endpoint users. The paper also mentions a case study involving a collaboration between a researcher and a cardiologist, indicating that the focus is on interdisciplinary collaborations involving ML. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
