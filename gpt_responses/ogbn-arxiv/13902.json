The proposed solution involves training a neural network (cs.LG) in an unsupervised manner (cs.AI) to rank points in a transformation-invariant manner. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning techniques (cs.NE) and validates the approach on two tasks, including cross-modal interest point detection (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
