Additionally, the paper also involves the analysis of user engagement with clickbait and non-clickbait contents, which could fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also involves the study of the distribution of topics in clickbait and non-clickbait contents, which could fall under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The use of machine learning models and large-scale data analysis could also make this paper relevant to the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category.
