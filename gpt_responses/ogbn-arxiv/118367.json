This is a common problem in deep learning, and the proposed solution is applicable to a wide range of networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the performance of the framework on different types of networks, which suggests relevance to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
