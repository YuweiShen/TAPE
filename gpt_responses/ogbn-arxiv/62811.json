The paper also introduces a reinforcement learning approach to dynamically choose which layers of a network to execute during inference, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses residual networks (ResNets), which are a popular architecture in computer vision, and explores their robustness to layer dropping, which could be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on image recognition tasks, which could be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
