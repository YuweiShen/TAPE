The paper also discusses the use of the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) framework, which is a popular approach in autonomous driving research and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of kinematic bicycle models, which are commonly used in control systems and fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the validation of the kinematic bicycle model using simulations, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
