It also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it uses 2D images as reference for 3D deformation. The paper also introduces a novel differentiable operation and uses a training strategy, which suggests it could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the paper involves handling meshes with different topologies, which could place it under the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
