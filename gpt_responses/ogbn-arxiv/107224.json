This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of linear superposition coding and block Markov encoding schemes, which are commonly used in Network Information Theory (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a graphical representation and proves a lemma, which are related to Graph Theory (cs.DS) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
