The paper includes experiments in both simulation and physical environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Given the focus on machine learning and robotics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also includes experiments with computer vision (for the grasping in clutter task), which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves optimizing the noise level to approximate the error of the robot's trained policy, which suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
