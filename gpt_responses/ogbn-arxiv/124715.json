The focus is on training agents to perform complex behaviors, which is a common goal in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific application is locomotion, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of visual information, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the emergence of robust behaviors, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
