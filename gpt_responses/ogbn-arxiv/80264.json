The use of submodular valuations is a common technique in this area, which suggests cs.AI as a possible category. The paper also discusses the competitive ratio of the Greedy algorithm, which is a common technique in approximation algorithms (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses a natural LP formulation for budget-additive allocation, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
