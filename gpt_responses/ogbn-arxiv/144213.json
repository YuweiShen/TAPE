The use of knowledge graphs as side information is a relatively new approach, which falls under the scope of both cs.IR and cs.AI. The paper also discusses the algorithms used in knowledge graph-based recommender systems, which are typically machine learning-based and fall under the scope of the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the datasets used in these works, which falls under the scope of the Database (cs.DB) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses potential research directions, which could fall under the scope of the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
