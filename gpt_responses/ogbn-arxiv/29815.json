The proposed method involves quantization of messages, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the practical implementation of the decoder, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of lookup tables is a common technique in digital signal processing (cs.DS), which is also relevant to this paper. Finally, the paper discusses simulation results and performance analysis, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
