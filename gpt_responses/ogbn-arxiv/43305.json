The paper proposes a perfectly secure 3-server ORAM scheme which is of interest to the cryptography and security community. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new ORAM scheme that outperforms the best known single-server scheme by a logarithmic factor. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms, which is of interest to the data structures and algorithms community. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the problem of information-theoretic security in the multi-server setting. The paper proposes a perfectly secure ORAM scheme which is of interest to the information theory community. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed ORAM scheme and shows that it outperforms the best known single-server scheme by a logarithmic factor. This involves analyzing the computational complexity of the proposed scheme, which is of interest to the computational complexity community. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with the problem of ORAM in the multi-server setting, which involves distributed computing. The proposed scheme involves distributing the data across multiple servers, which is of interest to"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
