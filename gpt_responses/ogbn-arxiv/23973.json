It optimally designs the power-splitting ratios for both training and data phases to achieve the best ergodic capacity performance while maintaining a required energy harvesting rate. This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.WM (Wireless Communications and Networking): The paper deals with a wireless communication system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) over a block-fading channel. It discusses the design of a power-splitting receiver to make the best use of the received pilot and data signals to obtain optimal SWIPT performance. This falls under the domain of wireless communications and networking.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of a point-to-point system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) over a block-fading channel.
