The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning algorithms (cs.AI) and performance metrics (cs.LG) to evaluate the algorithms. The paper also mentions game theory concepts such as maxmin distance and equilibrium convergence (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the use of tools to facilitate experiments (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
