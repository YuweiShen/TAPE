The problem of minimizing interference while maintaining connectivity can also be viewed as a graph theory problem, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of the problem, which involves analyzing algorithms and information theory (cs.IT). The problem of minimizing interference can also be viewed as a game theory problem, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT).
