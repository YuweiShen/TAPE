This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves decision making in a stochastic environment. The paper also discusses optimization techniques (cs.RO) and system theory (cs.SY) in the context of constructing ambiguity sets. Finally, the paper presents empirical results that involve data analysis and statistical methods (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
