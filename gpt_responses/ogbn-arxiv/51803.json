Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the choices of parametrization, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and the optimization method, which falls under cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
