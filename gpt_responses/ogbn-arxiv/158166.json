The paper proposes a modification to the softmax activation function, which is commonly used in deep learning models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also conducts experiments on image datasets, which suggests that it may belong to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a new distance metric, which is a common topic in sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
