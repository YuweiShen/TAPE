It also discusses the properties and bounds of RAC graphs, which are a type of combinatorial object, making it relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents a result on the number of edges in arc-RAC graphs, which could be of interest to researchers in algorithms and computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
