The use of $\\ell_1$-minimization for this purpose is a well-established technique in the field of compressed sensing, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also presents simulation results for image denoising, which suggests that the proposed framework may have applications in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of orthogonal matrices and sparse error vectors, which are common tools in the field of linear algebra and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of the recovery guarantees, which involves the use of concentration inequalities and other mathematical techniques commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the problem of recovering a signal from measurements polluted by both gross sparse and small dense errors, which is a problem that arises in many practical applications and falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
