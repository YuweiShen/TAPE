The paper also discusses the use of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for interaction topology, which is a common technique in distributed control (cs.SY). The paper proposes a distributed algorithm for the followers to track the leader, which involves minimizing the control input, a topic that falls under the category of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of locally chosen offsets for the followers to form a formation about the state of the leader, which is a topic in machine learning and falls under the category of \"Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Overall, the paper is likely to belong to cs.MA, cs.SY, cs.DC, cs.LG, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
