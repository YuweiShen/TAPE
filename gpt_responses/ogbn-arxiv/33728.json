This involves transforming the spectral amplitudes into common and differential information parts, which can be jointly or disjointly detected at the receiver. This topic is closely related to information theory and signal processing. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with transmission over a fiber link, which is a common networking and communication scenario. The proposed precoding scheme aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of the transmission, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper does not fit neatly into any specific sub-category, but it could be considered as falling under \"Other Computer Science\". The topic is interdisciplinary, involving aspects of information theory, signal processing, and communication networks. \n- cs.PH (Physics and Society): The paper involves the physical phenomenon of soliton propagation in a fiber link, which could be of interest to the physics community. However, the focus is more on the information-theoretic and engineering aspects of the problem. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly deal with social or information networks, but the proposed precoding scheme could potentially be applied to improve the performance of communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
