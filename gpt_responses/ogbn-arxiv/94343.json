It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as these fields are closely related to computer vision. Multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories are less likely but still possible as the paper mentions ground truth data and bounding box coordinates, which could be related to multimedia analysis and security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
