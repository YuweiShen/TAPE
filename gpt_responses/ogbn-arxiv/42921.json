The paper also focuses on reducing computational costs, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves carefully tailoring the network structure, which could potentially involve neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions achieving high processing speeds, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
