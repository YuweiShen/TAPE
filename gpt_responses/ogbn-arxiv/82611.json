This measure is designed to capture information beyond the locality and is modeled as an iterated function that can be solved by fixed point iteration in super-linear time and memory complexity, making it suitable for large-scale graphs. The proposed similarity measure is then used to improve the quality of community detection in the SCAN algorithm. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SD (Software Engineering), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
