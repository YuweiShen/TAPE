Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of existing systems to supplement small amounts of annotated data suggests a focus on machine learning and data augmentation, which could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions using information retrieval techniques, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of deep learning is mentioned, which could fall under cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
