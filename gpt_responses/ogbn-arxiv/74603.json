The use of a recurrent convolutional neural network also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the focus on healthcare and medical applications could place it in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of facial images and video data could also suggest the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of regression for continuous pain intensity estimation could place it in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
