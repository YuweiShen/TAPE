The use of linearly dependent rows to create redundant random ensembles is a technique commonly used in coding theory (cs.DM). The analysis of stopping sets is also relevant in the study of error-correcting codes, which is a topic in computer communications (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the use of upper and lower bounds, which is a common technique in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of distributions, which is a topic in statistics and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
