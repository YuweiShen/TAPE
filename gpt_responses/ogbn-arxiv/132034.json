The concept of eventual consistency and probabilistic execution is also relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper touches on the need for applications to ensure consistency, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
