The paper also proposes a protocol design for an autonomous membership service for enclave applications, which involves distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.Distributed). The implementation of the proposed membership service in a system called AMES involves software engineering (cs.SE) and system design (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
