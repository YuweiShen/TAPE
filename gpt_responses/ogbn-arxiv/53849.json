This involves studying the conditional capacity problem of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white Gaussian noise subject to average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and nonlinear EH constraints at the EH Rxs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
