The paper also discusses security and permissionless aspects of the protocol, which could fall under the categories of cryptography (cs.CR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of logical clocks and fine-grained UTXO sharding suggests that the paper could also fall under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
