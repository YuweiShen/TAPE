The paper also discusses the convergence phenomenon of these codes, which can be related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and dynamical systems (cs.DS). The paper also presents simulation results, which can be related to computer science and computational physics (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of degree profiles, which can be related to network optimization (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
