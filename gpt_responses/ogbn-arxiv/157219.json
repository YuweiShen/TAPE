The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this application also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed visualization techniques and feature manipulation procedures also suggest a focus on visual analytics and information visualization (cs.SI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
