The use of a relay to facilitate communication suggests that cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is also a likely sub-category. The problem of coordinating two nodes can be seen as a control problem, which suggests that cs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible sub-category. The generation of i.i.d. copies of random variables suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the use of statistical techniques to prove the inner bound suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
