The paper proposes a novel discriminative method to detect influence from observational data, which involves training a ranking algorithm to predict the source of the next event in a cascade. This method has applications in prediction and explanation of event cascades, which are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
