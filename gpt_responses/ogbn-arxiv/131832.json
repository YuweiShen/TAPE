The paper also discusses the programming power and computability limits of the proposed abstraction, which could fall under the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper's focus on message-passing systems and process crash failures suggests that it could also be classified under the Distributed Systems (cs.Distributed) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
