The algorithm is inspired by recent lower bound constructions for sum-of-squares and related to the method of moments. The focus is on sample complexity bounds that are as tight as possible (up to additive lower-order terms) and often achieve statistical thresholds or conjectured computational thresholds. The paper specifically discusses community detection in graphs, which is a problem in machine learning and data science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
