The paper also provides theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the proposed concept. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper deals with optimization problems, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses adaptive influence maximization and adaptive feature selection, which are related to social networks and data mining, respectively, indicating that it could belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
