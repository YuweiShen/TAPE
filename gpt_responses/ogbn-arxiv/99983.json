Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves computer vision techniques for perception, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with control and safety aspects of autonomous driving, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
