The problem is formulated on a bipartite graph, which is a fundamental data structure in computer science (cs.DS). The proposed algorithm is based on a randomized secretary model, which is a common technique in online algorithms and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper also discusses applications in wireless networks, which fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
