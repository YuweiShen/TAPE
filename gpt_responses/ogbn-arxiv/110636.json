The concept of privacy is also closely related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of electronic polling and pricing of digital goods suggests a focus on computational complexity and algorithms (cs.CY, cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions a distribution of how agents value their privacy, which could involve information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
