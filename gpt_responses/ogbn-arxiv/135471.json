This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of a DSL for data-centric applications, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of type systems and type inference, which suggests that it may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the enforcement of policies in a global context, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
