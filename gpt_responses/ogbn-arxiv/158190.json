The paper introduces a new notion of coordinate expansion of a test graph, which is a graph-theoretic concept. This suggests that the paper may belong to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), or computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
