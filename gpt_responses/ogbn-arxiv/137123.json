The algorithmic aspect of the paper suggests that it could also be relevant to computer science theory (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the discussion of different ways of localizing homology classes could be relevant to computational imaging (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
