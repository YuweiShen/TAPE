It also discusses prediction markets, which are a type of mechanism design and game theory, falling under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Game Theory\" (cs.GT). The paper also touches on the topic of optimization and algorithms, which could fall under \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS).
