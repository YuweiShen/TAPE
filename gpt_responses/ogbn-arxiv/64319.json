Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses graph models for global association, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of multi-peak prediction, which is a machine learning technique, and hence, the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also likely. The paper also mentions the use of a new dataset, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with pose estimation in crowded scenes, which involves dealing with occlusions and interference, and hence, the sub-category cs.RO (Robotics) is also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
