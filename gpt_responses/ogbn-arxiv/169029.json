It also makes use of state space realizations, which are a common tool in control theory (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses notions of duality, which are relevant in algebraic coding theory (cs.DS) and systems theory (cs.SY). Finally, the MacWilliams Identity is a well-known result in coding theory, which could also be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
