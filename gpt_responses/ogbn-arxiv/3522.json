The algorithm is designed to handle the adversarial utility-based formulation of the problem and is a non-trivial extension of the Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3) algorithm. This makes it highly relevant to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new algorithm for the K-armed dueling bandit problem, which is a fundamental problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The algorithm is designed to handle the adversarial utility-based formulation of the problem, which is a common scenario in many AI applications. \n\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper provides experimental results using real data from information retrieval applications. This makes it highly relevant to the Information Retrieval sub-category. \n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for the K-armed dueling bandit problem, which is a fundamental problem in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms.
