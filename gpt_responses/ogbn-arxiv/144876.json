The use of audio analysis also suggests it could belong to the signal processing (cs.SD) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of contrastive loss, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and the use of self-supervised learning, which could also place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
