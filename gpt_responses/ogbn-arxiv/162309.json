Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the transparency of neural networks, which is a common theme in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The linguistic feature analysis mentioned in the paper also suggests that it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
