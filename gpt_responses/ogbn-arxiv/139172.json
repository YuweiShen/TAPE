The paper also discusses the use of local feature selection, which is a common topic in the subfields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions dealing with high dimensional data, which is a common challenge in the subfield of data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of regularization, which is a common technique in the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
