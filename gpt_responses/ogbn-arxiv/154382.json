The use of algorithms and computational complexity analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The focus on simulation relations and transition systems suggests that the paper may also belong to Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the mention of iterative algorithms and space efficiency suggests that the paper may also belong to Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
