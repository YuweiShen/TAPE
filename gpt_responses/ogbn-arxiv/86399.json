The paper also analyzes the trade-off between channel estimation and data codeword length, which involves system-level considerations and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses accurate models of the physical layer and queueing analysis, which are relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
