The use of group theory in the paper suggests that it may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), which often use algebraic techniques. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to complexity theory (cs.CC), as it deals with lower bounds for the size of extended formulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
