The proposed method uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with sparse learning and graph regularization to select discriminative features. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), computational linguistics (cs.CL), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
