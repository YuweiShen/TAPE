The paper specifically focuses on multilingual NMT and zero-shot translation, which are techniques used to improve translation for low-resourced languages. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of recurrent neural networks and transformer neural networks, which are machine learning models commonly used in NLP. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which deals with machine learning and related topics. \n\nAdditionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed methods, which involves training and testing on large datasets. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category, which deals with the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of monolingual data, which is a common technique in neural network training. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category, which deals with neural networks and related topics. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions the use of TED talks data, which is a type of audio-visual data. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
