The use of PSNR as a metric also suggests a focus on image processing and analysis (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper involves the selection of thresholds, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The evaluation of quality metrics also involves statistical analysis, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
