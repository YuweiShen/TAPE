The proposed method involves using a CNN-based global descriptor, which is trained using a triplet loss, and involves learning and aggregating deep features from multiple CNN layers. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves measuring the information gain of each region and layer using KL-divergence, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on image retrieval datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
