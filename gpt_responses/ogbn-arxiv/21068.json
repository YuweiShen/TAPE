This falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the challenges faced by 5G networks and beyond, particularly in the context of IoT ecosystem, and proposes VLC as a potential solution. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper deals with the challenges of massive connectivity of devices and proposes NOMA-VLC as a potential solution. This falls under the domain of communication and networking.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the potential of VLC for high data-rate applications, which is a key aspect of multimedia.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a power-allocation technique for the underlying scenario, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
