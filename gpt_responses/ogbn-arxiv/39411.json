The approach used in the paper involves clustering of call graphs, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of clustering algorithms, which is a topic in machine learning and data science (cs.LG, cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for automation of detection schemes, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
