The paper also involves theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, which are common in the fields of networking and information theory. The paper may also fall under the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.MA) due to the use of numerical experiments and analysis. Finally, the paper discusses the symmetry of MIMO systems, which may fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
