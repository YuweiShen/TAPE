The use of temporal information in the proposed method suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The proposed method involves segmentation and content recovery, which could be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category.
