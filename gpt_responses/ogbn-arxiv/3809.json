The paper also discusses the stochastic nature of the system and the purely local information available to individual agents, which are important features of distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also explores the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
