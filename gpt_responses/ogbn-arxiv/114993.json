The paper proposes a novel network architecture to estimate mutual information in high-level and low-level representations to extract domain-invariant and class-relevant features. This paper involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
