The paper also discusses the use of a coordinate descent algorithm, which is a common optimization technique in control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of beamforming, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of existing algorithms, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
