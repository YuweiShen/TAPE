The use of graph feedback is a specific setting that falls under the broader category of reinforcement learning. The paper also uses techniques from online learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves game theory (cs.GT) and information theory (cs.IT) concepts, which are relevant to the analysis of the algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
