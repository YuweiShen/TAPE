The authors also mention the use of computer vision techniques for object detection and pose estimation (cs.CV), as well as machine learning algorithms for grasping and motion planning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of integrating multiple subsystems and coordinating them in real-time, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
