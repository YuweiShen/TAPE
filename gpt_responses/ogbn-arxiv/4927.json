Additionally, the use of common knowledge of rationality suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves logical reasoning, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The concepts of sequential equilibrium and perfect equilibrium are related to decision making and optimization, which are studied in the subfields of data structures (cs.DS) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
