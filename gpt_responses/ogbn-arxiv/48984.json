Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also proposes a new scoring model that combines information entropy with neural network, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions clinical data mining, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
