The paper specifically focuses on a method called developmental compression, which uses mild mutations to lessen adverse changes to previously-evolved capabilities and compress specialized neural networks into a generalized one. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science, including neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
