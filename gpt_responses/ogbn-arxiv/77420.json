The proposed techniques involve neural networks and loss functions, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of these techniques to improve object detection accuracy suggests that the paper may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.RO), as accurate object detection is important for many robotic applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
