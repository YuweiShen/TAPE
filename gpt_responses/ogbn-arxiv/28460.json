The proposed technique of model splitting also has implications for artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS) as it allows for shared governance of large models. Finally, the paper's focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and its comparison to supervised learning (SL) suggests that it may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) community, which often deals with RL problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
