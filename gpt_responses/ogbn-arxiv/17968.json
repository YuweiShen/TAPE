Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Control Systems (cs.SY) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) to optimize control policies for unmanned systems. Finally, the paper also involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE) to learn the optimal feedback controllers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
