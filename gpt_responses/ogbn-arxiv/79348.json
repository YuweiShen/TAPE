The paper focuses on the empirical phenomenon of warm-starting yielding poorer generalization performance than models with fresh random initializations, which is a problem that falls under the category of optimization and generalization in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
