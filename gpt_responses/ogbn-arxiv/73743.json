The use of inverse optimal control (IOC) and neural networks also suggests a focus on optimization (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the problem of autonomous driving involves control systems (cs.SY) and robotics, which further supports these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
