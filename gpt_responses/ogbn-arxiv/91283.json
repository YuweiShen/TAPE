Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses different distance measures and restrictions on the choice of vertices, which are related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GR). The applications of curve simplification in graphics and geographical information science suggest that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
