This approach is validated empirically on problems where state observations consist of images. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with planning and control problems, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
