This involves the use of information theory concepts such as channel capacity and spectral efficiency. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers the radio stripe network architecture for cell-free mMIMO and discusses the cooperation among distributed access points (APs) to serve all users within the network. This involves networking and internet architecture concepts such as network topology and communication protocols. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a sequential processing algorithm for cell-free mMIMO that enables interference suppression while keeping the cost and front-haul requirements low. This involves systems and control concepts such as signal processing and optimization. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of cell-free mMIMO for high-speed data transmission and video streaming, which are multimedia applications. \n\n5. cs.COM (Computer Communications and Networks): The paper discusses the communication and networking aspects of cell-free mMIMO, including the use of distributed APs and the radio stripe network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
