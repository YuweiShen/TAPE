The specific focus on security-critical applications and the use of discrete domains suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of graphical frameworks and cost functions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
