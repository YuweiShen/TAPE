The paper focuses on the use of one-class classifiers (OCC) and their fusion for building such systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves the evaluation of the performance of these classifiers on behavioral biometric datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CY (Computers and Society). Additionally, the paper deals with the usability of these classifiers in building continuous authentication systems, which could also make it relevant to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
