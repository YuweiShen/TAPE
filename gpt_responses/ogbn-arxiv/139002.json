The use of deep inference and proof theory also suggests a connection to programming languages and formal methods (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the application of the logic BV in artificial intelligence, which could place it under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep inference and the calculus of structures also suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the expressiveness of the logic BV, which could place it under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
