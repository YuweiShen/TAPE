This topic falls under the category of computer systems and architecture (cs.AR), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of mixed-precision arithmetic also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY), while the optimization aspect relates to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
