The scheme is based on multivariate polynomial evaluation, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the security of the scheme, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The proposed batch variant of the scheme involves packing multiple plaintext bits into a single ciphertext, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves some mathematical analysis, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
