The approach involves decomposing the problem into submodels and using integer programming to produce heuristics, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The specific problem studied in the paper is a timetabling problem, which is a classic example of a combinatorial optimisation problem and falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
