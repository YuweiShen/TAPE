The proposed method involves learning-based frame pooling, which is a technique used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves optimization and learning, which are related to sub-categories such as cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
