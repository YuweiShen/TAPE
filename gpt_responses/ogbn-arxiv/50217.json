The method is applied to reduce the size of a graph, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper also discusses the comparison of their method with existing algorithms, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
