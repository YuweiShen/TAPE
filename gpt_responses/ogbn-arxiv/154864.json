The use of partial interference cancellation group decoding is a technique for reducing decoding complexity, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between rate, diversity, and complexity, which is a common theme in communication theory (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed codes, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
