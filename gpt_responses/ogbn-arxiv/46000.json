Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely categories. The paper also mentions the trend towards the use of higher carrier frequencies and massive MIMO transmission, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The study of competing strategies for communication, i.e., long hop and short hop, involves system-level analysis and optimization, which can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
