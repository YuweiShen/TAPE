Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses deep reinforcement learning, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning), and involves processing visual inputs, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper uses self-supervision to learn a compact and multimodal representation of sensory inputs, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper aims to generalize over different geometries and configurations, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
