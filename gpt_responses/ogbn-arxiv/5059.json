This topic falls under the natural language processing (NLP) domain, which is typically categorized under cs.CL. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of dataset properties on model design and training methods, which are relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also touches upon information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE) in the context of summarization models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
