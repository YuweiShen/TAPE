The paper also mentions tasks related to shape analysis, synthesis, and correspondence, which are common in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Geometry (cs.CG). The use of joint diagonalization algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
