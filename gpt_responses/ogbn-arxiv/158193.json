It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories as it proposes a new regularization function and approximation of the derivative of the activation function to improve the training of binary neural networks. Additionally, it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as binary neural networks are a popular area of research in the field of AI. Finally, it may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as the modifications proposed in the paper are based on linear operations that can be easily implemented into the binary training framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
