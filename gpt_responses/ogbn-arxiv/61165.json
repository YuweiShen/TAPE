This involves extracting surface point clouds from both modalities and using rigid point-based registration to compute a matching cost. This process involves several computer vision techniques such as feature extraction, point cloud registration, and 3D reconstruction. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper involves creating a 3D printed and painted phantom of a transverse colon segment to validate the proposed method. This involves using graphics software to design and create the phantom. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves processing and analyzing images from both OC and CTC modalities to match polyps. This involves several multimedia techniques such as image processing, feature extraction, and 3D reconstruction. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper involves developing a method to assist colonoscopists in locating polyps during OC examinations. This could potentially be integrated into robotic colonoscopy systems to improve their accuracy and efficiency. \n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential benefits of the proposed method, such as reducing healthcare costs, patient inconvenience, and discomfort. This involves considering the societal implications of the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
