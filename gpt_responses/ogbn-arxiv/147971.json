The proposed scheme involves linear combinations of messages, which is also related to network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of achievable rates, which is related to statistical learning (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes an efficient algorithm for finding the equations and integer combinations, which is related to optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
