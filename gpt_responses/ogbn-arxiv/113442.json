Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves space-time design, which falls under the subfield of signal processing and system theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses feedback overhead reduction, which is a practical implementation concern, and hence, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
