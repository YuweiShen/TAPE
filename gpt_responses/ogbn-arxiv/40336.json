The use of low-resolution ADCs is also relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the reduction of power consumption, which is a topic related to computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the simulation results involve the use of multimedia (cs.MM) to validate the derived ergodic rates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
