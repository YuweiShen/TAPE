The paper resolves the space complexity of two heavily studied problems, range top-k selection and range min-max, for all k = o(n). This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also deals with information theoretic minimum space, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial and geometric arguments, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves analyzing the space complexity of algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
