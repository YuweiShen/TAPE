It also deals with object-oriented libraries, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL). The study is empirical in nature, which suggests a potential fit for machine learning (cs.LG) or information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses guidelines for developers, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
