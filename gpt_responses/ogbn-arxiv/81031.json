The paper proposes a new method for object skeleton extraction using a fully convolutional network, which involves deep learning techniques (cs.AI). The method also involves the use of multiple scale-associated side outputs, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning for object detection (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of groundtruth skeletons, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on two skeleton extraction datasets, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
