This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): Large intelligent surfaces can be used for multimedia applications such as video streaming and virtual reality. The paper discusses the potential increase in spatial capacity density, which is relevant to multimedia applications.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The use of large intelligent surfaces can have a significant impact on networking and internet architecture. The paper discusses the potential increase in spatial capacity density, which is relevant to networking.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of large intelligent surfaces for wireless communication, which can be seen as a control problem. The paper also derives analytical expressions for the link gain and available degrees-of-freedom, which can be relevant to control systems.\n5. cs.PH (Physics): The paper starts from electromagnetic arguments to analyze the fundamental communication problem involving large intelligent surfaces. This is a physics-based approach and can be relevant to the cs.PH sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
