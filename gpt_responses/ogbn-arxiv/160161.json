The paper proposes a new traffic localization technique based on the combination of different key performance indicators (KPI) extracted from the operation and maintenance center (OMC), which involves the use of metrics and algorithms for data analysis and processing. Therefore, it can also be categorized under Multimedia (cs.MM) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with the security and privacy of wireless networks, which can be classified under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
