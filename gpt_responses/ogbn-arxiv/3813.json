The authors also mention the use of side information such as continuous values and high-level domain knowledge, which suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper explores advances in constrained clustering, which could also relate to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
