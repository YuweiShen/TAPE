The method involves splitting the machine learning models and deploying some layers into users' local devices, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The experimental evaluation is conducted on benchmark datasets of three computer vision tasks, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed approach also involves threat modeling and adversarial deep network construction, which is related to security and information retrieval (cs.SI). Finally, the approach involves partitioning and deploying layers, which is related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
