The use of game theory to design incentive-compatible insurance contracts suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT). The focus on IoT networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and social and information networks (cs.SI).
