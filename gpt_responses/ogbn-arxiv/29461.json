This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also uses the aligned image sets approach, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper deals with the optimization of the channel, which can be considered as a topic in computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
