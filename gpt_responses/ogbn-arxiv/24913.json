The paper specifically addresses the issue of adversarial examples, which are a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed modifications to the adversarial training method involve reducing computational power, which suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
