The use of bends in the drawings suggests a connection to graph drawing algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The reduction of the required number of bends for specific classes of planar graphs involves combinatorial techniques (cs.DM). The study of right angle crossings is related to the theory of graph embeddings and topological graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the use of quadratic area suggests a focus on space-efficient algorithms and data structures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
