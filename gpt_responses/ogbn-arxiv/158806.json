The use of recursion and modification of previous techniques suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the focus on space efficiency and streaming algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
