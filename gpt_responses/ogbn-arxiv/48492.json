It also addresses the issue of limited communication bandwidth, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of mobile devices and wireless communication suggests a possible connection to networked and mobile systems (cs.NI). The paper also deals with the optimization problem of joint device selection and beamforming design, which is related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for global model aggregation, which involves machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques, indicating a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
