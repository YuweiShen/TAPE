The approach proposed in the paper is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) combining image and text features to achieve optimal document separation results. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deals with image analysis and processing. \n\nThe paper also involves text features, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deal with natural language processing and text analysis. \n\nThe use of CNNs also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.DL (Machine Learning), which deals with deep learning techniques, and cs.LG (Learning), which deals with general machine learning methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
