This falls under the area of formal languages and automata theory, which is covered by cs.FL. The paper also involves the analysis of the maximal value and number of sets of periods and constants needed to describe a semilinear set, which relates to the study of data structures and algorithms, covered by cs.DS. The paper also involves the use of logic and set theory, which are covered by cs.LO.
