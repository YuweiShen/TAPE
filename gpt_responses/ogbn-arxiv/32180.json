The use of convolution neural networks and multiple kernel learning methods also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of face biometrics to spoofing attacks, which falls under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of image processing techniques such as anisotropic diffusion suggests that it may also belong to the Image and Video Processing (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
