The paper presents a method for automatically detecting discourse segments that can be nested, which is an important step towards full discourse parsing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP and related fields. \n\nThe paper also uses standard multi-class classification techniques, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which covers machine learning and other AI-related topics. \n\nThe paper's approach involves a heuristic for enforcing global coherence, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.LG (Learning), which covers machine learning and related topics. \n\nThe paper's focus on discourse parsing could also make it relevant to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which covers topics related to search engines and information retrieval. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of French data suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category cs.CY (Computers and Society), which covers topics related to the social and ethical implications of computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
