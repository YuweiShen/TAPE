The use of social bots to amplify low-credibility content suggests a strong connection to social media (cs.SOC) and cybersecurity (cs.CYBER). The analysis of large-scale data on Twitter messages and articles suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR).
