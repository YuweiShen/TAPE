Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for discovering knowledge from geo-text data, which suggests the relevance of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of spatial databases and spatial data management, which relates to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
