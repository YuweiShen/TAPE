Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), followed by cs.MS (Mathematical Software) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). The paper also mentions the integration of the library with existing partial differential equation solvers, which suggests a possible fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.SC (Scientific Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
