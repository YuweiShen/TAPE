The paper proposes a method for decoupling the structure and lexicon of logical forms, which is a key challenge in semantic parsing. This approach involves mapping an utterance to an abstract, domain-independent, logical form that represents the structure of the logical form, but contains slots instead of KB constants. Then, the slots are replaced with KB constants via lexical alignment scores and global inference. \n\nGiven this focus on semantic parsing and NLP, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as these sub-fields are also relevant to the development of natural language processing systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
