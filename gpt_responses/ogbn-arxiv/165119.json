The use of universal sentence representations and the development of an annotation schema for consistent automated claim detection further supports this categorization. Additionally, the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves the development of an automated system for factchecking. The use of machine learning algorithms and the benchmarking of the system also suggest a possible categorization under cs.LG (Learning) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
