Specifically, the paper discusses the identifiability of epidemics spreading via contact networks, which is related to the field of social network analysis (cs.SI) and network science (cs.SD). The paper also presents algorithms for solving these problems, which is relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the diagnostic power of network information, which is related to the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and network inference (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
