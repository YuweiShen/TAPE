This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses cooperation strategies between transmitters, which could fall under the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category. The numerical simulations and comparisons with other coding schemes suggest that machine learning (cs.MM) techniques may have been used. Finally, the simplicity of the encoding/decoding algorithms could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
