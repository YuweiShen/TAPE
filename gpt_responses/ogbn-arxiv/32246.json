The paper proposes an incremental learning approach that involves sharing part of the base network, which is a technique used in transfer learning (cs.LG). The methodology also involves efficient training and reducing computational requirements, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on several recognition applications, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
