This makes cs.IT a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the construction of bent functions, which is a challenging problem and involves computational complexity. Hence, cs.CC is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Bent functions are widely used in cryptography and the paper presents new families of bent functions. This makes cs.CR a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with the construction of bent functions, which is a topic in discrete mathematics. Hence, cs.DM is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category is less likely, but the paper may be relevant to the study of Boolean functions in social networks or information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
