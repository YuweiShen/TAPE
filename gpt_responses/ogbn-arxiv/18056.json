This problem involves studying the almost lossless compression of a sequence of length $n$ from one source, given that the decoder has access to a sequence of length $m$ from the other source. The paper considers the scenario where the encoders do not communicate, and obtains a lower bound on the average minimax redundancy of almost lossless codes as a function of $n$ and the permissible error probability $p_e$. The problem involves information theory, distributed computing, coding theory, and statistical inference, which are all relevant to the sub-categories listed above."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
