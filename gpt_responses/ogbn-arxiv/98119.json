It also evaluates the performance of the embeddings on word similarity and word sense disambiguation tasks. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a system to learn embeddings and uses a sparse tensor formalization for efficiency and parallelizability. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with natural language processing and proposes a method to improve the representation of linguistic concepts. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper evaluates the performance of the embeddings on word similarity and word sense disambiguation tasks, which are relevant to information retrieval. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although not directly related to social networks, the paper proposes a method that can be applied to other resources like Freebase, which is a knowledge graph that can be seen as a network of entities and relations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
