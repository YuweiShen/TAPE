The use of a multi-resolution ConvNet for learning keypoint descriptors suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the approach on publicly available datasets suggests a focus on graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
