However, the focus is on Remote Sensing imagery, which is a specific application area within computer vision. The paper also discusses various system parameters and proposes a query expansion method, which are topics related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of dimensionality reduction for faster retrieval computation times is also a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
