The paper extensively evaluates these parameterizations on CIFAR, ImageNet and language modeling datasets, showing significant benefits from the use of symmetry. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
