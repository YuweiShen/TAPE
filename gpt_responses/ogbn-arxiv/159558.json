The problem is related to other fundamental robot coordination problems, such as exploration, scattering, load balancing, and relocation of self-driven electric cars, which are also topics in distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper provides algorithms for arbitrary graphs and grid graphs, which are topics in graph theory (cs.DS) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of memory and communication constraints, which are topics in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
