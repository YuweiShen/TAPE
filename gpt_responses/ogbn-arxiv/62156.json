This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed method is applied to image tagging, which is a task in computer vision. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions that hypergraphs are frequently used to model high-order relations between content in social media sharing platforms. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of randomized algorithms for low-rank factorizations and matrix inversions, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper's focus on image tagging and the use of hypergraphs for modeling content in social media sharing platforms suggests that it may fall under the scope of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
