The paper focuses on the efficiency and practicality of the data structure, which uses linear space and sublinear query time for any $c>1$ including $c\\to 1^+$. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new data structure for the approximate near neighbor problem, which is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper also analyzes the query time for some standard LSH families, which involves the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions that the approximate near neighbor problem has applications in computer vision, which suggests that the paper may belong to this sub-category. However, the paper does not provide any specific application or experiment in computer vision, so this sub-category is less likely. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions that the approximate near neighbor problem has applications in machine learning, which suggests that the paper may belong to this sub-category. However, the paper does not provide any specific application or experiment in machine learning, so this sub-category"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
