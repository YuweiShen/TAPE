This work involves the use of generative models and non-linear embedding techniques, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available dataset for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation, which is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of deep architectures and regularization techniques, which are relevant to the field of cryptography (cs.CR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
