The use of $\\lambda$-tree syntax and the introduction of a new generic quantifier suggest a focus on logic (LO) and artificial intelligence (AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to software engineering (SE) and formal languages (FL) sub-categories due to its focus on constraint handling rules and syntax."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
