It covers topics such as waveform design, modulation, beamforming, and resource allocation, which are typically studied in the field of information theory (cs.IT). It also discusses the use of RF spectrum and the network infrastructure, which are relevant to the field of networking (cs.NI). The paper also discusses transmitter and receiver architecture and input distribution optimizations, which are relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses energy harvesters and their models, which are relevant to the field of electromagnetics (cs.EM). Finally, the paper discusses prototyping and experimentation, which are relevant to the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
