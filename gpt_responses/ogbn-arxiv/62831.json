This falls under the category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of SVMs in computer vision (cs.CV) and data mining (cs.DM) applications. Additionally, the proposed method involves modifying the SVM kernel, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
