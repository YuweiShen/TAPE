The paper proposes a novel framework for dealing with covariates, which involves feature extraction and fusion, indicating that machine learning techniques may have been used, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also mentions the use of Zernike moment invariants, which is a mathematical tool, indicating that the paper may also belong to the cs.MM (Mathematical Physics) category. Additionally, the paper deals with biometric identification, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely category.
