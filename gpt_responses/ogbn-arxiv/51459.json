The paper also discusses joint learning of detectors and representations, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions multiple instance learning, which is a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning from sets of instances rather than individual instances, and is often used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on ImageNet, which is a popular dataset in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
