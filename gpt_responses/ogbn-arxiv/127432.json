The method involves training temporal embedding models, which is a common technique in deep learning and neural networks (cs.DL). The paper also discusses the interpretability of the method, which is a common concern in information retrieval and machine learning (cs.IR). The study focuses on the biomedical domain, which is a common application area for machine learning and data analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the stability of the metric over time and its ability to distinguish individuals, which are common concerns in statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
