The paper also discusses structural properties of the set of feasible rates and transmission schemes, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents optimization results for the joint selection of source rates and network flow, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
