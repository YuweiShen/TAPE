This method involves sending a meaning-normal and independent image to a corresponding well-trained generative model. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes an image encryption method to protect image contents, which is a security-related topic. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves generating visually same images as the original ones, which is a computer vision-related topic. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image encryption and disguise, which is a multimedia-related topic. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a generative model to achieve image disguise, which is a machine learning-related topic. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves using a generative model to generate images, which is an artificial intelligence-related topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
