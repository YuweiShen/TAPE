The paper proposes a novel approach that combines self-supervised learning with contextual bandit learning to improve cumulative reward. This approach involves using a primary task (e.g. clustering, classification, embedding generation) and a secondary task (e.g. rotation prediction, colorization) to learn implicit labels from the training data. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
