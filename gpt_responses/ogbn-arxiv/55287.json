The tangential-sphere bound (TSB) and its improved versions are used to derive error exponents, which involves coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the growth rate of the average distance spectrum, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and expressions, which could be categorized as information theory and probability (cs.ITP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
