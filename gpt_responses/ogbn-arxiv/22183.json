The use of a separation oracle suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of optimization (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of numerical precision and the simplification of the algorithm, which suggests that it may be relevant to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of algorithms to compute equilibria also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the identification of equilibria with polynomial-sized supports, which suggests that it may be relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
