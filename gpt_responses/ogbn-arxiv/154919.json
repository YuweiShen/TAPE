The paper also introduces a novel tensor algorithm for unraveling the structure of high-dimensional distributions, which is related to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT). The algorithm is based on exploiting the structure of local optima of higher moment tensors, which is related to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the complexity of the algorithm, which is related to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with learning subspaces, which is related to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
