The proposed method involves designing a neural network (cs.CL) to generate character proposals, which is a task related to object detection (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of fully convolutional networks (FCN) also suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
