The emphasis is on accurately reconstructing a 3-D model of a structure of moderate size rather than mapping large open environments, with applications in architecture, construction, and inspection. The paper describes motion planning algorithms that determine appropriate successive viewpoints and attempt to fill holes automatically in a point cloud produced by the sensing and perception layer. The paper also mentions that the proposed algorithms do not require any initialization in the form of a mesh model or a bounding box, and the paths generated are well adapted to situations where the vision sensor is used simultaneously for mapping and for localizing the robot, in the absence of additional absolute positioning system. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are robotics (cs.RO), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
