This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), networked systems (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SP), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM). Therefore, these are the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
