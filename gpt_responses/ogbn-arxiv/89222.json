Specifically, the paper focuses on the construction of suffix trees and directed acyclic word graphs (DAWGs), which are well-studied data structures in the field of string algorithms. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). \n\nThe paper also mentions the application of the proposed algorithms to indexing multi-sensor data, which suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). \n\nThe problem of constructing indexing data structures for multiple texts can also be viewed as a problem in combinatorial optimization (cs.DM), since the goal is to find an optimal way to represent the texts using the given data structures. \n\nThe paper mentions the time and space complexity of the proposed algorithms, which suggests a possible connection to computational complexity (cs.CC). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new approach to representing the suffix tree and DAWG edges in the fully-online scenario, which could be viewed as a machine learning problem (cs.LG) of learning a more efficient representation of the data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
