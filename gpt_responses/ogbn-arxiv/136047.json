This involves the use of neural network models and the design of a novel network framework. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of typical neural network models, which suggests the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as possible options."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
