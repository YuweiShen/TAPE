The analysis also considers the system's non-ideal characteristics, which falls under the category of computer systems and networking (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the correlation among interference signals received across receive antennas, which is related to signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides a quantitative analysis of the impact of non-ideal UAV antennas on the overall system performance, which is relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
