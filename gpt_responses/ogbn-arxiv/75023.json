This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for estimating camera positions and 3D points, and robotics (RO) techniques for handling camera motion. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning (LG) and optimization (AI) techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
