The paper also discusses the convergence analysis of a message passing algorithm, which is a common topic in networked systems (cs.NI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The use of massive MIMO also suggests that the paper may fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
