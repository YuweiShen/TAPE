It also discusses methods of constructing and minimizing automata, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.IT). The paper involves some mathematical proofs and reasoning, which are common in logic (cs.LO) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper mentions the concept of atomic NFAs, which are related to the theory of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
