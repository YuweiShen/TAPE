The paper also discusses signal shaping, which is a common technique in communication systems (cs.COMM). The use of probabilistic shaping and geometrical shaping also suggests that the paper may fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with optimizing the performance of BICM systems, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
