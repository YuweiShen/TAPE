This makes it likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses memory management and behaviour with increasing problem size, which are relevant to Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also briefly considers other design decisions, which could be relevant to Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
