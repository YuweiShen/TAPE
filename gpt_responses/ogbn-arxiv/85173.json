This falls under the domain of programming languages and runtime systems. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Taint tracking is a technique used in security to detect potential vulnerabilities in software. This paper describes a taint tracking engine for WebAssembly, which is a security-related topic. \n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the implementation of TaintAssembly, a taint tracking engine for WebAssembly, which is a software engineering task. \n\n4. cs.AR (Architecture): The paper describes modifications to the V8 JavaScript engine to implement taint tracking for WebAssembly.
