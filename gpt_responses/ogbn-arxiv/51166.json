The use of motion capture and electromyography data also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for in-home technology-supported rehabilitation, which could fall under the category of cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). Finally, the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for event detection suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
