This involves robotics, computer vision, and control systems, which are all subfields of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the mapping requirements and the relationship between the UAV and ground vehicle velocities, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
