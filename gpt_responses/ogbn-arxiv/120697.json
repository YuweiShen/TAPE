The paper focuses on kernel-based methods and proposes a unified approach that simultaneously learns the cluster indicator matrix and similarity information in kernel spaces. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
