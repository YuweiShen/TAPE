Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a dual-stream network that processes information along two independent pathways, which involves learning to combine local and global appearance in a complementary way. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of visual context in aerial image understanding, which could be relevant to the categories cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
