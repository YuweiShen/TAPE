The use of spiking neural networks also involves the study of neural network architectures and optimization techniques, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also introduces novel methods for information transmission and neuron activation, which can be considered as machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The use of spiking neural networks for object detection is an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the energy efficiency of the proposed model, which is related to the field of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
