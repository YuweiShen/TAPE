However, the paper also uses neural chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to model dependencies among regions for adjacent mentions, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also uses soft-label training, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses deep learning models to perform the task, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also deals with information retrieval, as it aims to ground each entity mention in a given caption of an image to a corresponding region in that image, which is a task commonly studied in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
