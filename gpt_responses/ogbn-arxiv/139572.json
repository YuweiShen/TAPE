Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability) are the most likely categories. The paper also uses tensorization techniques, which are commonly used in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with communication complexity, which falls under cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
