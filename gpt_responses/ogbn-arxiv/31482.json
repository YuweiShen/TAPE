The paper also mentions the scalability of the method, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
