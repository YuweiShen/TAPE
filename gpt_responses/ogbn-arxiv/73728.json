The use of ontologies also suggests a connection to the field of logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses computational problems related to schema generation and query answering, which are relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper specifically studies focusing for selected description logics, which is a subfield of logic (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
