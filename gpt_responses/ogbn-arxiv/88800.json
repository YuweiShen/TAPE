This topic is closely related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The paper also mentions the use of polyrepresentation of information, which is a concept in information science (cs.IR, cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of informetric distributions, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CR) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IR and cs.DL, followed by cs.SI, cs.CY, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
