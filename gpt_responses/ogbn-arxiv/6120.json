The paper provides theoretical justification for the TTL approximation, which is a state-of-the-art method for approximating the hit rate of an LRU cache. This involves analyzing the convergence of the approximation under independent stationary request processes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.PF (Probability), and cs.MA (Mathematical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
