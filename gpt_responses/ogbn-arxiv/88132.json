The paper also discusses equilibrium selection in dynamic distributed systems with multiple equilibria, which is a common topic in game theory. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses a fundamental game related to virus propagation on networks and presents analytical bounds on the ePoA in basic network topologies. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a game related to virus propagation on networks and presents analytical bounds on the ePoA in basic network topologies. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses coordination issues arising in open distributed systems, which is a topic related to systems and control. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses a game related to virus propagation, which is a topic related to cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
