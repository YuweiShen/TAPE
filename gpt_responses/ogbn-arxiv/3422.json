The paper proposes a tighter variational representation for f-divergences and derives a general f-divergence estimator based on two i.i.d. samples. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
