The proposed method involves the use of feedback CNN network (FB-Net) and class activation mapping method (CAM) with multi-channel pulse coupled neural network (m-PCNN) for pixel level detection. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
