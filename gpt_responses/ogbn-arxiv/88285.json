The paper also discusses convergence rates and algorithms for optimization, which are topics in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of local quadratic approximations of loss functions is a common technique in optimization and machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also involves analyzing and comparing experimental results, which is a common practice in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses generalization error, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
