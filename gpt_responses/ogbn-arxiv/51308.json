The method proposed involves linear equalities and inequalities, which are commonly used in optimization and linear programming (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of maxentropic Markov chains, which are a topic in probability theory and stochastic processes (cs.PR). The paper's focus on calculating upper bounds on the capacity of constraints suggests that it may also be relevant to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
