The paper also mentions the use of graphs and manipulation of (co)algebraic structures, which are relevant to the cs.GR and cs.DS sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new semantics for non-commutative !-graphs, which could be relevant to the cs.LO sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of abstract tensor notation, which is relevant to the cs.IT sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
