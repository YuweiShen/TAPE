The paper proposes a two-layer coalitional game for distributed sensing and access in multichannel CR ad hoc networks, which involves cooperative sensing and spectrum access. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the physical-layer approach to distributing the network-level miss-detection (MD) constraints fairly among the interfering SUs, which could fall under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with spectrum sensing and access, which are key aspects of cognitive radio networks and could place the paper in the computer networks and communications (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method for ensuring guaranteed PU protection, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
