The use of air highways and platoons is a solution to the problem of tractable analysis of large multi-agent systems. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): This sub-category deals with the study of systems composed of multiple interacting agents, which is the focus of the paper.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category deals with the design, construction, and operation of robots, which includes unmanned aerial vehicles.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the analysis and control of complex systems, which is relevant to the proposed method for managing unmanned aerial vehicles.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents and their behavior, which is relevant to the modeling of unmanned aerial vehicles as hybrid systems.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data, which is not directly relevant to the paper but may be used in conjunction with the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
