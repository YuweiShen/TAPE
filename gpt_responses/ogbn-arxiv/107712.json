The paper also discusses the tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper introduces an efficient algorithm, which involves optimization and selection, that is relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
