The paper also proposes a new technique for improving the accuracy of object detection, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper specifically addresses the problem of scale sensitivity in object detection, which is a common issue in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Therefore, these five categories are the most likely to be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
