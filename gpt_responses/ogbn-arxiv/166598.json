Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. Additionally, the paper proposes an algorithm for constructing the bijective BWT (BBWT), which involves information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the applications of BWT in text mining and pattern recognition, which are related to data mining (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
