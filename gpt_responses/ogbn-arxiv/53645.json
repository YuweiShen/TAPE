The paper also mentions the use of RNNs in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV), which are subfields of AI. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of gradient descent and evolutionary strategies in training RNNs, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
