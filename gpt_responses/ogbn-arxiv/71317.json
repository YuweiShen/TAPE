The use of deep neural networks for content-adaptive representation learning suggests that the paper may also fall under the subcategories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed approach on standard benchmarks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
