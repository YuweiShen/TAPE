The paper also discusses real-world systems, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper discusses the theoretical conditions under which fairness composes, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents an analytical framework for understanding and diagnosing fairness in multi-task ML systems, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
