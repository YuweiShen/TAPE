It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as convolutional neural networks are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, it may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as these fields are closely related to machine learning and neural networks.
