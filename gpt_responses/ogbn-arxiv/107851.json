The use of automorphism to reduce the number of variables in the linear programming problem suggests a connection to discrete structures (cs.DS). The study of binary constant subblock-composition codes and binary subblock energy-constrained codes involves combinatorial optimization and coding theory, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SI and cs.CC. Finally, the use of closed-form solutions and numerical examples suggests a connection to machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
