The use of the SINR metric and power allocation also suggests that the paper may belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the use of multiple antennas and receiver diversity suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
