The system is built on top of an interpreter for logic programs with partial functions, which extends the paradigm of Answer Set Programming (ASP). This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG), as well as Databases (cs.DB) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) due to the focus on logic programming and rule-based systems. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Computer Engineering (cs.CE) due to the application of the system in a medical setting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
