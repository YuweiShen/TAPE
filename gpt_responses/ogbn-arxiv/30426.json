The use of similarity measures in nearest neighbor classification and the construction of a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The analysis of Bayesian similarity in a framework of multitask learning suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
