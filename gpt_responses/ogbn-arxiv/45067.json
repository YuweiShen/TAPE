The paper proposes a neural approach to ground rules for relation extraction, which involves learning a relation extraction module and a soft matching module. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves mining patterns from large text corpora, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper focuses on label-efficient methods for relation extraction, which could be relevant to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE) that deals with semi-supervised and unsupervised learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
