This falls under the scope of programming languages.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on memory safety vulnerabilities in WebAssembly and proposes secure compilation criteria to prevent attacks. This falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design of a memory-safe variant of WebAssembly and how it could allow for relaxed forms of memory safety. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the memory-safety sandbox used by web browser engines to confine the execution of WebAssembly programs. This falls under the scope of computer architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the mechanisms used by WebAssembly to enforce memory safety and how they could be improved in the long term.
