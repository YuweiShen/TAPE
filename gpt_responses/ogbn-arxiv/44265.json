Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of camera rotation, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a popular machine learning technique and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experiments with image processing techniques, which is a sub-field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
