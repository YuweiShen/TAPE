This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). However, since the paper focuses on deep neural networks and their performance in OOD detection, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
