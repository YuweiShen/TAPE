The use of asymptotic minimax robustness and the consideration of uncertainty classes suggest a focus on statistical learning theory (cs.LG) and statistical inference (cs.ST). The use of Sion's minimax theorem and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers suggests a focus on optimization and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the application of the theory to spectrum sensing suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
