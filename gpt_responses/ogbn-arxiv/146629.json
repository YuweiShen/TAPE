The use of matching theory algorithms to resolve conflicting preferences of spectrum providers and users suggests a game-theoretic approach (cs.GT). The evaluation of performance using Monte Carlo simulations suggests a focus on simulation and modeling (cs.SI) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
