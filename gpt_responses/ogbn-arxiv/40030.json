The use of random matrix theory to analyze the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix is a common technique in information theory. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with a simple PSK model with AWGN, which is a common signal processing problem. The use of eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix for spectrum sensing is also a signal processing technique. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with cognitive radio networks, which is a networking problem. Spectrum sensing is a key problem in cognitive radio networks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper introduces two eigenvalue-based quickest detection algorithms, which can be seen as machine learning algorithms. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of detecting the presence of a signal in a noisy environment, which is a control problem. The use of quickest detection algorithms can also be seen as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
