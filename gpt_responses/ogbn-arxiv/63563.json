This involves the use of massive Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications with high efficiency, which falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The use of millimeter waves and the study of subcarrier frequencies and Virtual Channel Model Beams (VCMB) based inner precoding falls under the category of Multimedia (cs.MM). The study of sub-grouping methods and precoding techniques falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Computer Communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
