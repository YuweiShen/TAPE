This is a key aspect of human-computer interaction. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes the use of deep reinforcement learning for exploring parameter spaces in sound design. This is a key aspect of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper describes a system for sound design that involves both human and artificial agents, which can be seen as a control system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
