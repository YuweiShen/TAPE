It also discusses security protocols such as TLS, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. The use of TCP and its performance implications could also make it relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. The paper proposes a new architecture for managing TCP, which could be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact on application performance, which could make it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
