The paper also discusses structuring techniques for software design, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE) or programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions real-time requirements and error detection, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of distributed software, which could fall under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
