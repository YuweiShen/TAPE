The use of reconfigurable antennas also involves antenna theory (cs.NT). The paper also discusses the impact of user-to-user interference, which falls under the category of system and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a new achievable sum DoF for partial channel state information, which could be considered as a machine learning approach (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
