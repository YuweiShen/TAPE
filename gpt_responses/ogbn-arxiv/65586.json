The paper also proposes a method to leverage coarsely annotated data, which involves machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and semi-supervised learning, falling under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques such as fine annotation, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with image processing techniques, which fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
