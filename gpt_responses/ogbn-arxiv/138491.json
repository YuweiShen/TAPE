This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a cooperative relay network, which involves multiple nodes communicating with each other. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper analyzes the performance of a communication system under different wireless environments, which involves control and optimization of the system. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the effect of the non-periodic nature of chaotic sequence on the bit energy of the modulation, which is relevant to multimedia applications.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper presents a computation approach for the BER expression based on the probability density function of the bit energy of the chaotic sequence, which involves computational techniques.
