The specific problem of re-dividing a cake among old and new agents can be seen as a variation of the cake-cutting problem, which is a subfield of computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper also proposes protocols for different geometric constraints on the cake and its pieces, which involves algorithm design and analysis (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the price-of-fairness, which is a topic in algorithmic game theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
