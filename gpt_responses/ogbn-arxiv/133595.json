The approach involves a shallow encoder \"condition\" stack and a deep \"language model\" stack of multi-headed attention blocks. The paper focuses on natural language generation and biomedical research, which suggests that it could belong to the categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
