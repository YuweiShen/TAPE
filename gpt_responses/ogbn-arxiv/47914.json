The proposed method involves sparse representation and feature selection, which are also common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Gabor wavelets and extreme learning machine auto-encoder (ELM-AE) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
