This paper deals with natural language generation and information retrieval, specifically in the context of generating post-modifiers for entities. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval from Wikidata, which falls under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper also discusses the need for modeling contextual relevance, which is a common theme in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
