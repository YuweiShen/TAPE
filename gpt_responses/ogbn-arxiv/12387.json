The system uses natural language processing techniques to generate sensible sentences describing an unknown object, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The system also extracts semantic meanings of the object usage in the form of a query string, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The system uses machine learning techniques to represent the query string as multiple types of visual guidance, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
