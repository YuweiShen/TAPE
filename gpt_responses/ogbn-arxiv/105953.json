The paper describes a new version release of a molecular simulation tool for calculating thermodynamic properties of fluids consisting of rigid molecules. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), which includes papers on the development and application of computational methods in engineering and science. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of molecular dynamics simulation and Monte Carlo methods, which are commonly used in the field of computational chemistry. Therefore, cs.MS (Computational Methods for Molecular Systems) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of parallelization techniques, such as MPI and OpenMP, which are commonly used in the field of high-performance computing. Therefore, cs.CM (Computational Mathematics) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the calculation of thermodynamic properties, which falls under the field of statistical mechanics.
