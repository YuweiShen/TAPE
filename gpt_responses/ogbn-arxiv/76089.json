Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas and the impact of channel estimation error, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
