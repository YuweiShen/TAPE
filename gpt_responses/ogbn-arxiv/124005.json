The paper also proposes a novel feature selection technique using metaheuristic algorithms, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.NE). The use of machine learning algorithms for intrusion detection also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential of cognitive computing for intrusion detection, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
