It proposes a novel approach to specializing the full distributional vocabulary using external lexical knowledge. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses adversarial learning and global specialization function, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper uses L2-distance loss and cross-lingual transfer, which are related to neural networks and information retrieval, respectively, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
