The algorithm is also applicable to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) as it can handle continuous and discrete actions. Additionally, the paper evaluates the algorithm on OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, which are often used in computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
