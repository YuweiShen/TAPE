This involves adapting subspaces for bounding box features from source to target domains. This paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category as it deals with object detection and image analysis. It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it proposes a novel technique for domain adaptation. Multimedia (cs.MM) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) categories are also possible as the paper deals with real-world datasets and their evaluation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
