It also involves the undecidability of the domino problem, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the construction of tile sets using fixed-point constructions, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions the use of substitution rules, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of tile sets with high Kolmogorov complexity, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
