This problem is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research, as it requires developing algorithms for image and video analysis. The paper also proposes novel representations and matching techniques, which involve machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) methods. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of security and privacy in surveillance systems, which is a topic of interest in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
