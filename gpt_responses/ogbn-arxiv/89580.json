The method uses advanced techniques from statistical natural language processing, such as nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic tree substitution grammars, which could also place the paper under the natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also deals with the semantics of the resulting idioms, which could place it under the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents evidence that the idioms describe important program concepts, which could place it under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
