It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it focuses on neural networks. Additionally, since the paper discusses the behavior of test error with increasing network sizes, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the paper presents a capacity lower bound for neural networks, it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
