This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of powerful computers and new techniques for training deeper networks, which could fall under the categories of graphics (cs.GR) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of obtaining high-quality labeled data, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
