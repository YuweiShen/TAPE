The paper proposes an extension to MapReduce, which is a widely used framework for mining big data. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DB (databases), cs.DC (distributed, parallel, and cluster computing), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.IR (information retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
