The paper also uses linear function approximation with tabular, binary, and non-binary features. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper also discusses the stability of the step-size, which falls under the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for a real-world application suggests the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possibility."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
