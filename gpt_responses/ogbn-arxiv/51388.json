This falls under the scope of distributed computing. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the properties and consistency guarantees of a ledger object, which is relevant to the security and cryptography aspects of distributed systems. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper defines a ledger object as a sequence of records and provides the operations and properties that it should support. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper deals with the implementation and consistency of a ledger object, which is similar to the concerns of databases. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper provides implementations of distributed ledgers and discusses the challenges and trade-offs involved in achieving different consistency guarantees.
