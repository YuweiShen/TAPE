The paper also mentions the use of quantization and denoising regularization methods, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Bayesian estimators, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE).
