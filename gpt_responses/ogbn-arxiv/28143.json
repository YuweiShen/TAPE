Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science, which is cs.CL. Additionally, the paper proposes several training methods based on data boosting and bootstrap, which are related to machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG and cs.AI also likely sub-categories. The paper also experiments on an English-French translation task, which involves image processing and computer vision, making cs.CV a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of deep networks, which are related to neural networks and cs.NE could also be a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
