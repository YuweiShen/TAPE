The paper also proposes a method for reducing the model size and computation complexity, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The use of quantization in the model is also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between model size and accuracy, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
