These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of context-encoded HRMs, which involves probabilistic voting and fusion of hypotheses, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed approach on popular benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
