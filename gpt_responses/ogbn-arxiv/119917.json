This involves the coordination of agents to scan data from internal DW and external sources, semantically integrate relevant data, and report it to business users according to business rules. The approach also involves the acquisition of knowledge represented in enterprises' ontologies from business users without extensive technical knowledge using user-friendly user interfaces based on constraints and predefined templates. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (for the agent-based approach), cs.DB (for the data warehousing aspect), cs.IR (for the information retrieval aspect), cs.SE (for the software engineering aspect), and cs.CY (for the cybersecurity aspect)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
