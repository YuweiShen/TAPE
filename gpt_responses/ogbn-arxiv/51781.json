The paper describes a system for solving real-world university entrance exam questions related to world history using Wikipedia as the main external resource. The system uses a classification-based model for solving multiple choice questions, which is a common technique in natural language processing and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are all relevant to natural language processing and classification. Additionally, since the system uses external resources and employs machine learning techniques, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DL (Deep Learning) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
