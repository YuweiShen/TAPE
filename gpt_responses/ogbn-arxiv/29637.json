The paper also discusses the use of size-tiered LSMs, which are commonly used in database systems (cs.DB). The paper's focus on optimizing IO performance suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfields of distributed computing (cs.DC) and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents new data structures and algorithms, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
