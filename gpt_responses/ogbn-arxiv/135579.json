The paper also mentions the use of formal axioms to constrain the interpretation of primitives, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the transformational passage from the classification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
