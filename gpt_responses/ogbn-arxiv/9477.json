The use of pointwise group convolution and channel shuffle also suggests a focus on efficient computation, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments conducted on ImageNet classification and MS COCO object detection could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
