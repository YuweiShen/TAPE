This makes it highly relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper formulates platform-aware NN architecture search in an optimization framework, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on different platforms, which is relevant to the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
