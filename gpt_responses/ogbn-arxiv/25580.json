The proposed approach involves combining multiple classifiers, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a subfield of machine learning that falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The evaluation of the approach is done on public datasets, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to improve classification accuracy, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
