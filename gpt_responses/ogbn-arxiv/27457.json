This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the weight distributions of the codes, which is a topic related to coding theory and graph theory, indicating that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories.
