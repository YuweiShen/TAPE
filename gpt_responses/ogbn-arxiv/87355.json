It also discusses the need for analyzing spreadsheet errors in a wider human behavior context. \n2. cs.CY (Computational Geometry) - This category is less likely, but the paper does mention the application of simple linear algebra to a costing problem, which could potentially involve computational geometry. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses spreadsheet creation and usage, which falls under the domain of software engineering. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The costing problem mentioned in the paper could also fall under the domain of computational finance. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - This category is less likely, but the paper does mention the measurement of cell error rates, which could potentially involve data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
