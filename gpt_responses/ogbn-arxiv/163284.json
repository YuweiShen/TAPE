The paper also discusses the space and time complexity of the data structure, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.SC). Additionally, the paper presents an algorithm for computing an implicit representation of a vertical shallow cutting of the geodesic distance functions, which involves numerical analysis and optimization (cs.SI). Overall, the paper is most likely to belong to cs.CG and cs.DS, but also has relevance to cs.GR, cs.SC, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
