Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and transmission schemes, making cs.IT a likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a new transmission scheme for millimeter-wave communications, which is a key technology for future wireless networks. The proposed scheme aims to improve spectrum and energy efficiency, which are important considerations in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on millimeter-wave communications, which are often used for high-bandwidth multimedia applications. The proposed scheme aims to improve the efficiency of these communications, making cs.MM a possible category for this paper.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a dynamic power allocation scheme to maximize the achievable sum rate, which involves optimizing power allocation across multiple beams. This optimization problem can be viewed as a control problem, making cs.SY a possible category for this paper.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): While less likely than the other categories, the paper does discuss the potential benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency, which is a topic of interest in the field of computers and society."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
