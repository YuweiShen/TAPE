The approach involves training predictive models using labeled data, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using image-based state representations, which suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of oracle feedback, which could be relevant to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
