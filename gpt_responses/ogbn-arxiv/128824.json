This topic falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The method involves using an object embedding network to compress object feature vectors, which relates to computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR). The paper also evaluates the method using a selection of games, which falls under game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
