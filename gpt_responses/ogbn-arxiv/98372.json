The use of a refactoring specification language and the decomposition of complex transformations into smaller steps suggest a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The mention of semantics and static analysis also point towards formal methods (cs.FL) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
