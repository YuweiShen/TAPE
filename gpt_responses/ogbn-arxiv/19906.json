This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses statistical contexts and numerical experiments, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents upper bounds that make the previously determined lower bounds optimal, which is a topic in optimization theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
