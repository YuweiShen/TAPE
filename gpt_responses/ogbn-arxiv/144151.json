The proposed method involves removing redundant blocks based on discrimination of output features, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves experimentation and analysis, which could fall under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
