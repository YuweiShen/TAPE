The paper also discusses the need for defensive techniques to detect and mitigate these attacks, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed method, UnMask, is based on robust feature alignment, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
