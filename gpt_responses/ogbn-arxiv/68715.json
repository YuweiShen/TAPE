The proposed scheme is an authentication code, which is a topic related to cryptography (cs.CR). The scheme is designed for multicast network coding, which is a topic related to network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the performance of the scheme in terms of throughput and goodput, which are topics related to data structures (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
