The use of Gaussian distributions and Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix manifold also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves feature normalization methods, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of hierarchical covariance descriptors and the development of novel descriptors could also suggest that it belongs to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
