The paper also discusses the use of quadratic measurements, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of the input set, which is a topic of interest in the field of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of empirical risk minimization, which is a common technique in statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
