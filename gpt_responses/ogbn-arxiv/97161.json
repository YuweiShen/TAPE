The use of provenance for intrusion detection also involves analyzing system execution, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). Provenance data is often stored and managed in distributed systems (cs.DC) or databases (cs.DB). Finally, the use of provenance for intrusion detection involves analyzing large amounts of data, which can benefit from machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
