The paper also focuses on the need for better explainability and interpretability of these models, which is a common concern in the field of AI. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI, which deals with the development and application of AI models. The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of domain knowledge, which is relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves the application of predictive analytics in finance, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
