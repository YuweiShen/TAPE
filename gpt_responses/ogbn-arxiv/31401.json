It addresses the issue of traditional PoW schemes requiring correct devices to work perpetually, which is highly inefficient with respect to operating cost and ecological footprint. The paper proposes a general PoW scheme that grows slowly as a function of the cost incurred by an attacker, which guarantees security in the event of an attack while keeping algorithmic costs small in the absence of an attack. The paper also demonstrates how this new PoW scheme can be leveraged to address important security problems in distributed computing, such as Sybil attacks, Byzantine consensus, and Committee election. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
