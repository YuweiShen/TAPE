The paper also discusses the use of heuristics and semantic analysis, which are common techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) subfields. The focus on improving MT system scores suggests a connection to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) subfield. Finally, the use of a language-independent approach and the potential for application to any text domain or language pair suggests a connection to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
