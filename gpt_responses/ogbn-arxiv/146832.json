The use of stochastic geometry tools to analyze the performance of the framework suggests that it belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The focus on joint design of passive beamforming weight at the LISs and detection weight vectors at the users suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
