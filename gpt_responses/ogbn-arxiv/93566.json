It also involves the concept of secrecy constraints and eavesdropping, which are related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of structured signaling and cooperative jamming suggests a focus on networked information systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of asymptotic real interference alignment, which is a technique used in multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
