The focus on graph complementation and induced subgraphs suggests a stronger likelihood of cs.DM and cs.GT, while the algorithmic nature of the problem and the polynomial time results suggest cs.DS and cs.CC as well. The use of cographs as an example of a graph class also suggests cs.CG as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
