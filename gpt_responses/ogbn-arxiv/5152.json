The paper also mentions deep learning-based coding tools and end-to-end image/video coding, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper explores the new area of Video Coding for Machines (VCM), which involves prediction and generation models, aligning with the rising Analyze then Compress instance Digital Retina, and bridging the gap between feature coding for machine vision and video coding for human vision, which are all related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
