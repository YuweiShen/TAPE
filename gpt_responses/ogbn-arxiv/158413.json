The use of geometric path loss and interference models suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes efficient algorithms for solving the scheduling problem, which falls under the sub-category of Algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
