This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also introduces a new type of convolutional layer, which involves learning question-guided kernels, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on public VQA datasets, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
