The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on avionic security screening and detection of prohibited objects suggests that it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of multi-view pooling and 3D aggregation of features suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
