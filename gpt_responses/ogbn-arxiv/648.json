Specifically, the paper proposes the use of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) for state representation and Generative Replay for maintaining past knowledge. These techniques are commonly used in the sub-fields of deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper applies these techniques to the domain of robotics (cs.RO), which is a common application area for reinforcement learning. The paper also mentions the use of image data (cs.CV) and provides a method for automatic environment change detection, which falls under the sub-field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
