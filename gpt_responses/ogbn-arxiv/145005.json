Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of smart metering infrastructure, which involves the integration of hardware and software systems, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category as well. The use of time series forecasting techniques also suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category.
