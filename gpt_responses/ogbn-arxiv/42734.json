The use of linear models and a weighted voting system also suggests the involvement of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM), which are covered by cs.LG. Additionally, the use of image data for product classification may also involve computer vision (CV) techniques, making cs.CV a possible category. Finally, the use of deep learning (DL) models cannot be ruled out, making cs.DL a potential category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
