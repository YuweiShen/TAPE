The study involves human-subjects and focuses on human-robot interaction, which is also relevant to the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper proposes two novel predictive models based on machine learning techniques, which fall under the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of trust transfer for robot decision-making, which is related to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
