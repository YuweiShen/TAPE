The paper also mentions the Knowledge Plane proposed by D.Clark et al., which is related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a new paradigm that accommodates and exploits SDN, NA, and AI, which involves system design and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the lack of adoption of AI techniques in network operation and control, which is related to security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents experimental results that support the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, which involves machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
