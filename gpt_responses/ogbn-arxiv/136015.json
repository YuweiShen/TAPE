The proposed solution involves using edge compute nodes to provide services, which is related to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and augmented reality (cs.AR). The paper also mentions the use of software-defined networking (SDN) and mobility support, which are topics in systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of the proposed solution, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
