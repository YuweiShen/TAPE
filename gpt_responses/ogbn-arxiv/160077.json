The paper deals with question answering using web tables, which involves information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Hence, \"cs.IR\" and \"cs.CL\" are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses deep neural network-based semantic similarity, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the quality of information in web tables, which is related to database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper's focus on improving the performance of web search engines suggests that it may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
