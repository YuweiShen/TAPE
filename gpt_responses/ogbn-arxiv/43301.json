This suggests that computer vision techniques are a core component of the system.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the integration of advertisements into video sequences, which is a multimedia-related task.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions targeted advertisement, which involves retrieving relevant information about the viewer to show them relevant ads. This suggests that information retrieval techniques may be used in the system.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of deep learning techniques for effective detection of existing adverts and seamless integration of new adverts into video sequences. This suggests that machine learning techniques are a core component of the system.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper may involve natural language processing techniques for analyzing the content of the video and generating relevant ads.
