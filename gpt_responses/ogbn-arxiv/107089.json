Computer vision techniques are used to extract visual context cues from the environment to train the predictor. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for agent motion prediction using context maps. The predictor is trained using a multi-task learning framework, which is a common technique in AI. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for agent motion prediction using context maps. The predictor is trained using a multi-task learning framework, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a method for predicting agent motion in cluttered environments, which is relevant to robotics applications. The proposed approach can be used to improve the accuracy of trajectory prediction for robots operating in cluttered environments. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for predicting agent motion in cluttered environments, which is relevant to systems and control applications.
