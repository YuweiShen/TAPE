This is a core topic in programming languages research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the implementation of the approach in the Cubix system, and evaluates its effectiveness in terms of ease of configuration, readability of output, and handling of language corner-cases. These are all relevant to software engineering.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the authors mention using machine learning techniques to evaluate the readability of the output code. This could potentially place the paper in the machine learning sub-category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with multiple programming languages, and discusses the handling of language corner-cases. This could potentially place the paper in the computation and language sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This is the least likely sub-category, but the paper does briefly mention the potential impact of their work on software development practices and the broader software engineering community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
