The paper also mentions that these problems are members of the class of sum-of-products (SUMPROD) problems, which are closely related to constraint satisfaction problems and optimization problems (cs.DS, cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of backtracking search, which is a common technique in computer engineering for solving combinatorial problems (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
