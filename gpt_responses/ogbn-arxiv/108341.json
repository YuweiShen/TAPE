The proposed method involves clustering the training data using input features, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). The paper also mentions the use of word embeddings, which is a popular technique in NLP. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions named entity recognition, which is a common task in NLP and information retrieval (IR), so cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
