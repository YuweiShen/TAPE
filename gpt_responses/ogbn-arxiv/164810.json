The paper also proposes a learning-based method for ensemble of multiple super-resolution models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also involves training and optimization of the models, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of deep neural networks, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
