The paper also discusses the use of product distribution matching (PDM) as a shaping device, which involves combining the output of several parallel distribution matchers (DMs), a technique that could be relevant to the field of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the power efficiency of PDM compared to other techniques, which could be relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
