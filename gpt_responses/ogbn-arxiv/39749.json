The paper also discusses the use of self-supervised and consistency-based learning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on the COCO dataset, which is a popular benchmark for multimedia tasks (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of data distillation, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
