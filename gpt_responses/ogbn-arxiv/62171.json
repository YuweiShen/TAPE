The paper proposes a learning-based approach to solve the problem of modulation design for SWIPT over a point-to-point link. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
