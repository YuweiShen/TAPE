This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) domains. The paper proposes a novel method that learns domain-invariant visual concepts and transfers knowledge from subtitled sign news videos to improve word-level sign language recognition. This involves designing a classifier and using an external memory, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) domains. Finally, the paper also discusses the effectiveness of their method in automatically localizing signs from sign news, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
