However, the paper also relates these concepts to studies of episodic memory in the mammalian brain, which suggests a connection to the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
