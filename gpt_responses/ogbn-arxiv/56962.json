Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of multiple classifier heads and their elimination during training, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of the BERT model, which is a popular model in computer vision (CV) and NLP. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
