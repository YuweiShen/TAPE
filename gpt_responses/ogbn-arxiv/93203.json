Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves sensor fusion and deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with 3D semantic maps, which are related to computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
