This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The proposed scheme is related to wireless communication and can be applied to multiple antenna systems. This falls under the domain of communication and networking.\n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper involves signal processing techniques for modulation and demodulation of signals in a multiple antenna system.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme can be applied to wireless networks and can potentially improve network performance.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme can be used for transmitting multimedia data over wireless networks, and hence falls under the domain of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
