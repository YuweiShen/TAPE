Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a sequence-to-sequence model using recurrent neural networks (RNN), which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
