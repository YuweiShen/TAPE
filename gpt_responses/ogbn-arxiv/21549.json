The study of majority digraphs is closely related to graph theory (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG), as the authors use experimental methods to evaluate their results. The complexity-theoretic insights provided in the paper suggest that it may also belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. However, given the focus on voting and preference aggregation, the most likely sub-category is game theory and decision theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
