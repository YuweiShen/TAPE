This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions embeddings of the calculus in the theorem prover Isabelle, which is commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses meta-tools for adapting the tool to user-defined calculi, which could fall under Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's focus on reasoning and formalizing proofs could also place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
