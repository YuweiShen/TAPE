The application of the method in wideband spectrum sensing of cognitive radio suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SP). The use of compressed sensing techniques and model order selection techniques suggests that it may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of sensor array imaging suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
