The use of a threshold model and the adoption of multiple alternatives suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The characterization of social networks and the determination of unique outcomes suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Game Theory and Economics (cs.GT). The study of algorithmic questions and the determination of whether a given node adopts a product suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of polynomial time algorithms and the study of the minimum possible spread of a product suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
