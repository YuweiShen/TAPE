The method involves a regularization technique that constrains the incoming weights of each neuron to be unit-norm, which is a technique that can be applied to various types of neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper involves experiments on image datasets, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
