The use of a dyadic decomposition scheme and the analysis of the entropy of a discrete common randomness variable suggest that the paper may also be relevant to cs.DS. The focus on simulating continuous random variables in a distributed manner suggests that the paper may be relevant to cs.SY. Finally, the use of log-concave pdfs and the analysis of a new measure of entropy suggest that the paper may also be relevant to cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
