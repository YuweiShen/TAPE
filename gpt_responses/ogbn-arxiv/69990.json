It also discusses the use of a hybrid storage system, which involves both hardware and software components, making it relevant to cs.OS (Operating Systems). The paper also mentions the need for efficient resource allocation and workload management, which are topics covered in cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of QoS policies, which are relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a prototype system, which could fall under the category of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
