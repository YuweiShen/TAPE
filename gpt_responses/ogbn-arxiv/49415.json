This is a topic that falls under data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the topic of multi-system optimization is relevant to machine learning systems that often require processing large amounts of data across different systems. \n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the challenge of executing computation among multiple available systems, which is a topic that falls under software engineering. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper introduces a new algebra, Lara, which can be seen as a new programming language for data processing systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
