The use of reconfiguration graphs to model the search space also supports this categorization. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the optimization step of timetabling problem instances, which is a common problem in the field of artificial intelligence. The use of Kempe-exchange during the optimization step also supports this categorization. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the theoretical framework for investigating the connectedness of clash-free timetables, which involves the study of reconfiguration graphs. This is a common technique used in the field of machine learning for modeling complex systems. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the conditions for the connectedness of clash-free timetables, which is a problem related to the computational complexity of timetabling problem instances. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the theoretical framework for investigating the connectedness of clash-free timetables, which involves the study of reconfiguration graphs.
