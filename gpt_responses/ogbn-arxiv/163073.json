Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication and information processing. The paper also involves networked systems and control, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper proposes an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is a statistical inference technique, and hence cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a likely category. The paper also involves experimental validation of the proposed method using a massive MIMO testbed, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a model for the calibration error based on the asymptotic properties of the estimator, which involves statistical learning and hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
