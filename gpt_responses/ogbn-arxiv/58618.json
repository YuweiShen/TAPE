The use of compressed sensing for signal processing and image compression is also discussed, which relates to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The statistical analysis of the measurements and the investigation of performance bounds involve machine learning and statistical inference, which are relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
