The use of side information and the Markov form also suggest the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the analysis of trade-offs and the exploration of different message rates suggest the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
