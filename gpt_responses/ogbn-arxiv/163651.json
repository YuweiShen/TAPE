The paper proposes a new approach to address the challenge of multi-modal distributions over future sequences. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.SD (Systems and Control), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
