Additionally, the paper introduces nominal games, which are stateful games cast in the theory of nominal sets, a topic that falls under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions modelling functional languages with names, which is a topic studied in the sub-category of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses general references, which are a type of reference used in programming languages, a topic that falls under the sub-category of computation and language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
