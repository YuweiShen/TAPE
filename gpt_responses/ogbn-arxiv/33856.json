This problem is related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also presents complexity analysis and optimization techniques, which are relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed algorithms in robotics and automation, which fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
