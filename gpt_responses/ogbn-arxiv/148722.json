The technique involves regularizing the feature vectors, which are also tunable in deep learning, in addition to the weight vectors. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL), which are all relevant to deep learning and classification tasks. Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely categories, as the paper focuses on regularization and classification using deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
