This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a general curriculum training strategy and a dynamic sampling method to speed up training, which indicates that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with medical images, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
