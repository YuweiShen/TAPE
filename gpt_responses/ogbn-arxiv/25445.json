This approach involves transforming conventional high level programs into multi-stage dataflow engines, which are particularly suitable for implementing streaming processing pipelines. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses a new approach to high level synthesis for FPGA platforms, which involves mapping high level functions to an architectural template before hardware synthesis is performed. This is a topic related to hardware architecture. \n\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses a target template that is suitable for implementing streaming processing pipelines, which involves parallel and distributed computing. Therefore, the paper is likely to be related to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses a new approach to high level synthesis for FPGA platforms, which are often used in embedded systems. Therefore, the paper is likely to be related to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses transforming conventional high level programs into multi-stage dataflow engines, which involves programming language concepts such as dataflow programming. Therefore, the paper is likely to be related to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses a new approach"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
