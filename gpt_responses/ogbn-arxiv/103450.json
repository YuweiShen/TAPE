The paper focuses on the network softwarization and network function virtualization, which are subfields of computer networking (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the development toolchain for virtualized network services, which involves software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the management of available resources in service provisioning platforms and underlying infrastructures, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI, followed by cs.DC, cs.SE, cs.SY, and cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
