This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also deals with the use of temporal logic specifications and probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) to generate an MDP control policy, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the use of noisy actuators and limited accuracy gyroscopes, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with the construction of a finite approximation for the motion of the vehicle in the form of an MDP, which falls under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
