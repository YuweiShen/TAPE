The method involves graph sampling, which is a technique used in data science and statistics (cs.SI). The paper also discusses normalization techniques and sampling algorithms, which are relevant to the field of data science and machine learning (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on large graphs, which may involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
