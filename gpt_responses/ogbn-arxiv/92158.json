The use of operational semantics to formalize the implementation technique also suggests a software engineering (cs.SE) perspective. The paper also discusses the use of parallelism, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
