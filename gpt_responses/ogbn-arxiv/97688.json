The paper also mentions the potential security implications of this sensitivity, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes an algorithm to create universal adversarial perturbations, which is related to the field of adversarial machine learning (cs.AI, cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
