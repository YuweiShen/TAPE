Hence, it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of ANN model for the task of orthographic transparency estimation is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and hence, this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.AI.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses datasets derived from Wikimedia dictionaries, which can be considered as a form of information retrieval. Hence, it is possible that this paper could be categorized under cs.IR.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This paper does not directly deal with societal issues, but it does provide insights into typical mistakes made by learners in reading and writing, which could be considered as a societal aspect of education. Hence, it is possible that this paper could be categorized under cs.CY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
