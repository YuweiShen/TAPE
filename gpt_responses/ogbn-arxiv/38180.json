The topic is closely related to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data compression (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of the PEZY-SC processor, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). The application of the proposed method in computational science and engineering (cs.CE) is also mentioned. Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the algorithm, which is related to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
