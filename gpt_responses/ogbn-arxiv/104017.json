This involves the use of predictive models to approximate the value of the objective function, which is computationally expensive. The paper proposes a meta-model framework that dynamically adapts the substitution strategy to the solution space of the given optimization problem. This involves learning a surrogate from training examples that correspond to past evaluations of the objective function. The framework can be seamlessly coupled with an arbitrary optimization algorithm without any modification. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
