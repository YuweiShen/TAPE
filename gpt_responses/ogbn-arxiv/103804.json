Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the use of computational graphs and sparse structure for computational efficiency, which suggests a possible fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The stability analysis and experimental results on high-DOF manipulation systems may also relate to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
