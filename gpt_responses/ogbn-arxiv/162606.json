This involves machine learning techniques and hence, cs.LG is a likely sub-category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the quality of a dataset used for intrinsic evaluation of cross-lingual word embeddings and its impact on the ranking of different systems. This involves information retrieval techniques and hence, cs.IR is a possible sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the evaluation of cross-lingual word embeddings and discusses the impact of dataset quality on the results. This involves AI techniques and hence, cs.AI is a possible sub-category. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the quality of a dataset used for intrinsic evaluation of cross-lingual word embeddings and its impact on the ranking of different systems. This has implications for the fairness and reliability of NLP systems, which is a topic of interest in the field of computers and society. Hence, cs.CY is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
