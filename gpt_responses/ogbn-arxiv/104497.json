It also involves information theory (cs.IT) in terms of the randomness and unpredictability of the beacon outputs. The use of XORing multiple beacons together suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and possibly parallel computing (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of time sharing as a strategy for enhancing trustworthiness suggests a potential connection to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
