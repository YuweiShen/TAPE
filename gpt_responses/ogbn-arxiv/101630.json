The proposed method uses deep learning techniques, which are also commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of a surrogate task for training the model, which is a common approach in information retrieval (cs.IR) research. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of image forensics, which is a subfield of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
