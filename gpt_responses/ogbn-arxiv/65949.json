The study also focuses on human behavior and the efficiency of space utilization, which suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect. The use of DCNN also implies an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) component. The paper also involves training and analyzing the model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG).
