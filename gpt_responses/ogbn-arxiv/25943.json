This involves the use of deep neural networks (cs.CV) and unscented Kalman filter (cs.SY) for modeling the dynamics of the target and estimating its motion. The paper also discusses the challenges involved in modeling the target's dynamics and the uncertainty associated with process noise, which requires the use of machine learning techniques such as UKF and YOLO (cs.AI, cs.LG). Overall, the paper's focus on tracking and estimation using UAVs suggests that it belongs to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
