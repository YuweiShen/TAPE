This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of RNNs and NCA objective function for learning features from sequential data can also be considered as a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The learned features can be used for visualization and nearest neighbour classification, which are common tasks in computer vision. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with sequential data, which is a common topic in natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses RNNs, which are a type of neural network, for learning features from sequential data.
