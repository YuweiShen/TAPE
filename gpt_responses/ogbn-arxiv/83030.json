The paper also proposes and evaluates machine learning-based approaches, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of knowledge graphs and their vector space embeddings falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with uncovering coherence patterns in conversations, which falls under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
