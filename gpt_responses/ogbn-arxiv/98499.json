Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with wireless networks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper proposes a new algorithm, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also deals with millimeter-wave frequencies, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with the design of wireless systems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
