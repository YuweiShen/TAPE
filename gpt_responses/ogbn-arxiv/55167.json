Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also mentions next-generation networks, which falls under the sub-category cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the accuracy of analytical results, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions investigating both average BLER and BER, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
