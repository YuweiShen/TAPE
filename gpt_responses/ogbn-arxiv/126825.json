Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of ensembling and loss balancing techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of external data and the fusion of meta data with the CNN suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of dense neural networks suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the use of different model input resolutions suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
