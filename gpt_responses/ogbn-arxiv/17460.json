This problem is closely related to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, and control systems. The paper proposes an iterative method with strong guarantees for agnostic system identification, which can be applied to both discrete and continuous domains. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
