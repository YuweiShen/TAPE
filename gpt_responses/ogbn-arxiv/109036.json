The paper proposes an alternative approach to solving MIL problems using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and discusses the challenges in encoding MIL in ASP. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), and Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
