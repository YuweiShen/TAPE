The paper proposes a new method for selecting transitions to use in the gradient update based on the fraction of variance explained. This method is evaluated on a variety of standard benchmark environments, including continuous control problems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
