The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques for phase retrieval, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques for reducing forward model error, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper uses simulations to evaluate the proposed method, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
