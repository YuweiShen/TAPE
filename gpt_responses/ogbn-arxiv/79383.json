This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework is applied to image classification tasks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of boxes as an abstraction technique is commonly used in program analysis (cs.CR), and the paper draws inspiration from this field. Finally, the paper discusses the performance and robustness of the proposed framework, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
