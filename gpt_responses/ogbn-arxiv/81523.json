The paper also provides theoretical analysis explaining the improved robustness of the proposed model against input perturbations/adversarial attacks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in computer vision tasks, which suggests the possibility of cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the stability of the proposed model, which suggests the possibility of cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
