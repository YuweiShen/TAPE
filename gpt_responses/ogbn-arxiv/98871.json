The methodology used involves probabilistic inference, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence, suggesting the paper could also fit under cs.AI or cs.LG. However, given the focus on social networks and the use of Bayesian frameworks, cs.SI and cs.SD are the most likely categories.
