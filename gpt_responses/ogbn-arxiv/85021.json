The paper presents bounds on the size and asymptotic rate for two classes of subblock-constrained codes, which involves combinatorial and algebraic techniques (cs.DS, cs.DC). The paper also discusses the application of subblock-constrained codes in diverse fields, such as coding theory, cryptography, and communication systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides numerical examples comparing the rates for different types of codes, which involves computational methods (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
