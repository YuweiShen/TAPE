This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it deals with training neural networks. The paper also presents empirical results on image classification tasks (cs.CV) and discusses the robustness of the proposed method against adversarial attacks (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the uncertainty estimation of BNNs (cs.AI) and the use of MMD in variational inference (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
