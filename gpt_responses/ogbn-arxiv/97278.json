Information theory is a natural fit for analyzing the performance of such techniques. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a joint radar and communication system, which involves control and coordination of multiple subsystems. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the transmission of digital information over a communication channel, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of digital modulation techniques for transmitting data, which is a key aspect of multimedia systems. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): While not directly related to the content of the paper, the use of OTFS modulation has been explored in natural language processing applications, which could potentially be mentioned in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
