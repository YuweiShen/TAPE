Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a method for estimating the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary, which involves machine learning techniques such as neural networks and optimization, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves controlling the output words based on the estimation, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on an abstractive summarization benchmark, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
