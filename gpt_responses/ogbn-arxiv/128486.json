The use of Computability Logic and the application to cryptanalysis and neural nets suggest that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are likely sub-categories. The discussion of information storage and computational trade-offs suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) as possible sub-categories.
