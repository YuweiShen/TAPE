Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the link capacity, which is related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions mobile networks, which could fall under cs.MA (Mobile Computing), and discusses the use of simultaneous transmissions, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper briefly mentions multicast capacity, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
