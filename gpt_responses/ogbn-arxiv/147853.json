The use of MMSE receivers also suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SY) and communication systems (cs.COM). Finally, the paper presents new closed-form expressions for the achievable sum rate, which could fall under the category of mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
