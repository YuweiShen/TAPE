The paper proposes a novel attention mechanism called Recursive Visual Attention (RvA) to resolve visual co-reference in visual dialog. This involves browsing the dialog history until the agent has sufficient confidence in the visual co-reference resolution and refining the visual attention recursively. This work involves computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CV and cs.CL sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel attention mechanism, which involves recursive refinement, which could fall under the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with a task that involves information retrieval and reasoning, which could also place it under the cs.IR sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
