The paper also mentions previous work on these problems, which have been studied extensively in the computer science community. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
