Additionally, the paper mentions the use of polynomial time cut elimination strategy, which is a common topic in Proof Theory (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the encoding of binary numerals, which could fall under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with the structural complexity of terms, which could be relevant to the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
