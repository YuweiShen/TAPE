This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely category.\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed reinforcement learning framework, which involves exchanging experience memory between agents. This falls under the domain of distributed computing, making cs.DC a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of control theory. Therefore, cs.SY is also a possible category.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework for distributed reinforcement learning, which involves exchanging a proxy experience memory to preserve the privacy of actual experiences.
