This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM), as well as signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of spectral analysis. Additionally, the paper discusses source prediction, which is a common topic in speech and audio processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
