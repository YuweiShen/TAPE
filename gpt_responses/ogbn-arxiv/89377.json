This falls under the domain of machine learning and data science, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.LG and cs.DS. The use of smoothing algorithms also involves signal processing, which is covered by cs.CV. The paper also discusses the use of domain knowledge in specific classification problems, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI.
