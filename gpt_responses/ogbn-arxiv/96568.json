The main focus is on improving the spectral and energy efficiency of next-generation wireless networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of stochastic geometry and transmission coordination, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions the use of tools for evaluating network performance, which could be relevant to the sub-categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
