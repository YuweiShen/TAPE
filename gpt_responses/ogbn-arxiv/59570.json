The use of deep learning feature representation and multi-scale context information also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The exploration of part selection and the joint training of modules may also indicate relevance to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
