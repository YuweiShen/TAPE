This involves techniques from machine learning (meta-learning, federated learning) and distributed systems (edge computing), which are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science. Specifically, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories, as the paper focuses on developing a learning algorithm. The paper also involves distributed systems and optimization, which are relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control), respectively. Finally, the paper includes experiments on image datasets, which are relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
