Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are likely categories. The data structure is also based on decremental techniques, which are commonly used in data structures and algorithms, suggesting cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another likely category. The paper also mentions connectivity in planar graphs, which falls under cs.GT (Graph Theory), and the use of SPQR-trees, which are a specific type of data structure, suggesting cs.SI (Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
