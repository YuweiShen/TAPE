The use of state machines and dynamic programming also suggests a focus on algorithms and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of surgical datasets and surveillance videos suggests a potential application in medical imaging (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
