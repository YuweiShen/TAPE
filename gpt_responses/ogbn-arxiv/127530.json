The paper also discusses hyperparameter selection and early stopping, which are topics relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Lastly, the paper mentions Occam's razor, which is a principle often used in statistical learning theory (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
