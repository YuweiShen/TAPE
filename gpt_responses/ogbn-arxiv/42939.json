This fits well within the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed model and learning methods can be applied to various AI applications such as event prediction, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Temporal point processes are often used to model events in social and information networks, and the proposed model and learning methods can be applied to such networks.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes efficient learning methods for a new model of temporal point processes, which involves solving optimization problems and using regularization techniques. This fits well within the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves modeling the effect between pairwise markers using an infectivity matrix, which can be seen as a form of information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
