Therefore, it is likely to be classified under cs.SI.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the classification of text based on the stance taken by the author, which is a task related to information retrieval. Hence, it is likely to be classified under cs.IR.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses text classification approaches for stance detection, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms. Therefore, it is likely to be classified under cs.LG.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with the detection of fake news and rumours, which have a significant impact on society.
