The paper also presents a new visualization tool for high-dimensional data sets, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or computer graphics (cs.CG). Additionally, the tool is designed to integrate with existing infrastructure, which could relate to the sub-categories of computational engineering (cs.CE) or computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
