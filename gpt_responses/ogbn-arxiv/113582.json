The paper proposes a new method for hyperparameter optimization that involves sampling nonlocal paths instead of points in hyperparameter space. This method is applicable to a wide range of deep learning architectures and can improve training efficiency and accuracy. Given the focus on deep learning and optimization, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
