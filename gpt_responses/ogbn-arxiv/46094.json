This falls under the broad category of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communication (cs.COMM). The paper also involves the design of symbol arrangements and the use of message passing algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper mentions extensions to MIMO and multi-user scenarios, which are relevant to the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
