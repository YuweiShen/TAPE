The use of Brown clusters and class-based language difference models also suggests a focus on language modeling and text classification, which are common topics in cs.CL. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves the selection of relevant training data for machine translation, which is a machine learning task. \n\nThe use of the cynical data selection method and the focus on efficiency in modeling the task corpus suggests a potential fit with the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper's focus on language modeling and text classification may also make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the organization and retrieval of textual information. \n\nFinally, the use of machine translation as a specific application may suggest a connection to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with the use of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms in machine learning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
