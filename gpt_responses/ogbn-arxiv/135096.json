The use of category theory also suggests that the paper may belong to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also discusses ologs as a data repository, which relates to database systems (cs.DB). The application of ologs to describe primitive recursive functions suggests a connection to deep learning (cs.DL) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
