The focus is on developing an agency-based view of prosthetic devices, which is a key topic in robotics research. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper examines the interaction between humans and prosthetic devices, with a focus on communication and collaboration. The concept of communicative capital is introduced as a way of thinking about the communication resources developed by a human and a machine during their ongoing interaction. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of machine intelligence in enhancing human abilities, specifically in the context of prosthetic devices. The focus is on developing an agency-based view of prosthetic devices, which is a key topic in AI research. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of machine intelligence in enhancing human abilities, specifically in the context of prosthetic devices. The focus is on developing an agency-based view of prosthetic devices, which is a key topic in machine learning research. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the control and communication channels available to prosthetic users, and how these can be expanded through the use of agency-based prosthetic devices.
