This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of clustering and dissimilarity functions also relates to data mining (cs.DM) and similarity search (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper mentions the potential for the proposed approach to be applied to a variety of ML methods, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
