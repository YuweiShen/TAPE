The proposed protocols involve quantization of symbols and channel realizations, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.NI). The use of algebraic rings in the protocols suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory (cs.SY). Finally, the simulations involve modulation schemes such as QAM, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
