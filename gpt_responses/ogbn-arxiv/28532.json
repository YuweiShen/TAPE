This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically deals with computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The paper also discusses the use of batch normalization (cs.NE) and proposes new dropout variants (cs.AI) that are more suited for CNNs. Finally, the experiments conducted involve image classification tasks (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
