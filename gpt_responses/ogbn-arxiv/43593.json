This falls under the scope of programming languages research. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses a technique for automatically verifying properties of software programs, which is a key concern in software engineering. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with the synthesis of logical invariants, which is a topic of interest in logic and formal methods. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper involves the verification of properties of programs, which can be framed as a problem in formal languages and automata theory. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This is less likely, but the paper does touch on the issue of security in the context of verifying student-submitted solutions to online challenge problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
