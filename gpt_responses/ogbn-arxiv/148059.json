The presence of malicious nodes makes it relevant to the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.SI). The assumption of limited knowledge of the network topology suggests the sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI). The analysis of consensus and broadcasting algorithms relates to the sub-category of control and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the construction of robust graphs is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
