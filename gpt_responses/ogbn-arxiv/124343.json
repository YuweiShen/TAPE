This topic falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of this heuristic in technical domains, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions improving the quality of solutions, which could also be relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
