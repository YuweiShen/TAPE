This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of Turyn's method, which is a technique used in coding theory and combinatorics, indicating a possible connection to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the applications of ZCPs in communications and radar suggest a possible connection to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
