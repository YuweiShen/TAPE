The technique is also based on grouping of symbols, which could indicate that it belongs to the Data Structures (cs.DS) or Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions that the algorithm provides effective coding of symbols for very large alphabets, which could suggest that it belongs to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
