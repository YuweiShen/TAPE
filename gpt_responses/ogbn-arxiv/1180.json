The paper discusses a hybrid hardware-software load balancer, which is relevant to this category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new load balancing approach that utilizes hardware matching capabilities of NICs, which can be seen as a control system for managing the network traffic.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper proposes a new architecture for load balancing that utilizes hardware offloading capabilities of NICs, which can be seen as an architecture-level optimization.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not directly discuss security or cryptography, load balancing is an important technique for improving the availability and reliability of network services, which are important aspects of security and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
