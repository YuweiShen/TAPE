The paper also mentions the use of techniques from list decoding, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the decoding algorithm, which could fall under computer graphics (cs.CG) if it involves visualizing the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
