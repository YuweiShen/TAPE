The paper specifically addresses the challenge of running machine learning models on devices with limited memory, which is a common concern in the field of mobile computing and embedded systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
