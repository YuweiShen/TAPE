This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the design of the architecture and the use of skip connections, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also reports results on standard datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
