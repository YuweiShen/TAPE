The paper also talks about optimal contracts and incentives, which are key concepts in game theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper uses linear programming to compute optimal contracts, which is a computational problem. The paper also examines contract theory through the theoretical computer science lens. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper talks about worst-case approximation bounds, which is a topic in algorithms. The paper also uses linear contracts, which can be seen as a data structure. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of incentivizing an agent to take a costly and unobservable action, which is a problem of information theory. The paper also talks about the demanding informational requirements of optimal contracts. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper talks about designing outcome-dependent compensation schemes to incentivize an agent, which is a problem of machine learning. The paper also talks about the prevalence of relatively simple contracts, which can be seen as a form of regularization in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
