The focus on spectral and energy efficiency also suggests a possible fit with the cs.PF sub-category. However, given the emphasis on wireless communication and signal processing, we consider cs.IT and cs.NI to be the most likely categories, followed by cs.SY and cs.MM, and then cs.COM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
