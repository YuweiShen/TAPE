The proposed method uses a joint neural network architecture to model contextual dependencies between features of different modalities. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on enabling intuitive retrieval of fashion merchandise such as clothes or furniture. The proposed search engine combines visual and textual cues to retrieve items from a multimedia database. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a multimodal search engine that combines visual and textual cues to retrieve items from a multimedia database. The proposed method is tested on two different challenging datasets of fashion items and furniture. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method uses a joint neural network architecture to model contextual dependencies between features of different modalities. The paper also reports the performance of the proposed method on two different challenging datasets of fashion items and furniture. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a search engine that combines visual and textual cues to retrieve items from a multimedia database.
