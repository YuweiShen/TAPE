This topic falls under the category of Electronic Devices and Circuits (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper discusses analytical modeling and comparison of different MOSFET structures, which could also fall under Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) or Systems and Control (cs.SE). The paper also mentions calculations of threshold voltage and surface potential, which could fall under Electromagnetism (cs.EM) or Mathematical Physics (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
