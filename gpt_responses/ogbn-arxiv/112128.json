This suggests a focus on algorithmic techniques and data structures, which falls under the scope of cs.DS.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions solving a problem in the interference channel with multiple nodes, which is a common topic in information theory. Additionally, the use of Normaliz to find the Hilbert basis of the solution space suggests a focus on mathematical optimization techniques, which is also relevant to cs.IT.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the efficiency of the new method compared to the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) method, which suggests a focus on computational complexity. Additionally, the use of a step-by-step approach in the FME method suggests a focus on analyzing the time complexity of algorithms, which falls under the scope of cs.CC.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper involves solving systems of inequations, which can be seen as a logical problem.
