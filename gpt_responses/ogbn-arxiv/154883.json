The proposed algorithm does not require any numerical optimization solvers and can learn model parameters automatically with a closed-form solution. The experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, indicating that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
