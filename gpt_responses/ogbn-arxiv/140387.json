The use of ray-tracing simulations and channel sounders suggests a focus on modeling and analysis (cs.MA) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions antenna correlations and eigenvalue distribution, which are relevant to the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
