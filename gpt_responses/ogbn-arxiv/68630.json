This topic is closely related to information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM) as it involves targeting ads to specific people based on data about them. The paper also discusses the use of algorithms for optimisation, which falls under the category of data structures (DS) and cybernetics (CY). Finally, the paper provides insights into the bidding behaviours of the RTB system, which could be relevant to social and information networks (SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
