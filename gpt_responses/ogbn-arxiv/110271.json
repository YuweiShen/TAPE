The algorithms are based on planarization and separator decompositions, which are common techniques in graph algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses Voronoi diagrams and shortest paths, which are classic problems in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of geometric graphs with sublinearly many edge crossings is a specific subfield of computational geometry (cs.GR). Finally, the paper's focus on linear-time algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
