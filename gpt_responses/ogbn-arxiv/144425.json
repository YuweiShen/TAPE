The use of fast matrix multiplication suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.CC (computational complexity) categories. The paper also involves combinatorial and geometric arguments, which suggest that it may belong to the cs.CG (computational geometry) or cs.DM (discrete mathematics) categories.
