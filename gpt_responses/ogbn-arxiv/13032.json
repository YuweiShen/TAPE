The use of OR-constraints and the proposed solving technique involve optimization and search algorithms, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of programming languages and constraints, which are relevant to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
