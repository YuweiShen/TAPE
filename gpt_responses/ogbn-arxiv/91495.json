It also involves the interpretation of linear logic in a computational setting, which could be classified under programming languages (cs.PL). The use of games and simulations as a basis for the model could also be relevant to the sub-category of game theory (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the denotational model for the typed lambda-calculus, which could be classified under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the denotational model for the differential lambda-calculus, which could be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
