The techniques used in this paper involve analyzing the approximation obtained by higher levels of the SoS hierarchy, which is a common approach in computational complexity theory and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem also involves geometric optimization over the unit sphere, which suggests the sub-category cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as a likely candidate. The paper also mentions the use of random polynomials with independent $\\pm 1$ coefficients, which is a common technique in information theory and coding theory, suggesting the sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible fit. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between approximation ratio and running time, which is a common theme in machine learning and optimization, suggesting the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
