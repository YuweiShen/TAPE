It proposes two solutions based on compressive sensing and deep learning to design the LIS reflection matrices with negligible training overhead. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of channel estimation and designing reflection matrices for improving the wireless system performance, which is a core problem in information theory.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning-based solution for designing the LIS reflection matrices, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with improving the coverage and rate of future wireless systems, which is a key problem in networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel LIS architecture based on sparse channel sensors and develops solutions for designing the LIS reflection matrices, which involves control and optimization problems.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with improving the wireless system performance, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and reliable transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
