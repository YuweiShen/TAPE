The method proposed also involves compression and denoising, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of wavelet domain and histogramic profiles suggests that the paper may also belong to image processing (cs.IR) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
