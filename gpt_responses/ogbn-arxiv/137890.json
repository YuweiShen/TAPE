The use of local linear state-feedback controllers and graph search for selecting appropriate controllers suggests the paper may also fall under robotics (cs.RO). The use of linear and semi-definite programming for computing the local controllers suggests the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of positive invariant sets suggests the paper may also fall under optimization and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
