The focus of the paper is on enforcing important mathematical properties and physical constraints in these simulations, such as maximum principles and non-negativity constraints. The proposed approach is based on the variational inequality (VI) framework, which is a well-established method for solving PDEs with constraints. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), which deals with numerical methods for solving mathematical problems, including PDEs. \n\nThe paper also discusses the parallel and algorithmic performance of the VI approach, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.MS (Mathematical Software), which deals with the development and optimization of software for mathematical applications. \n\nThe paper's focus on subsurface applications and PDEs suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.CE (Computational Engineering), which deals with the use of computational methods in engineering applications. \n\nThe paper's use of optimization-based methodologies and solvers suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving computational problems. \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on large-scale computing environments suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.SC ("}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
