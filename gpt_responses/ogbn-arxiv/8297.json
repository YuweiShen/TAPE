The models are based on deep learning methods, specifically piecewise feed forward neural networks and self-attention neural networks. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with security and privacy issues related to fraud detection, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing and text classification, which could place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
