Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of crowdsourcing and the potential for artificial intelligence, which suggests that it could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of online platforms and data sharing could also place it under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
