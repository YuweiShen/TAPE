Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are likely categories. The paper also discusses the impact of design parameters on the detection performance, which falls under the category of cs.RM (Robotics and Control). Finally, the paper presents simulations to evaluate the detection performance, which is related to cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
