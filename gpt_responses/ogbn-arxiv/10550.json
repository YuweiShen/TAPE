The application of the proposed method is demonstrated on ultrasound imaging data, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the robustness of the method to noise, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
