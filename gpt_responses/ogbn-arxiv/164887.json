This involves using a basis and associated coefficients to describe the diffusion profile, and the authors choose the SHORE basis. The paper focuses on the design of a deep network to estimate the coefficients, and includes an auxiliary output for approximated fiber orientation (FO) errors to regularize the training. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
