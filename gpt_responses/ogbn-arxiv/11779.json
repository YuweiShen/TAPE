The use of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm also suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper provides a unified explanation for various isomorphism results, which could be relevant to logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
