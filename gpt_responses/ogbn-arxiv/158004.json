The method involves the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a popular machine learning technique (cs.LG). The authors also mention the use of soft cost functions, which are a type of optimization technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the evaluation of the proposed method on three different datasets, which is a common practice in computer vision research (cs.NE, cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
