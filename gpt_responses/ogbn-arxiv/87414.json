The use of semi-automated methods and quantitative analysis suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The comparison of different methods also indicates the possibility of neural network-based approaches (cs.NE). Finally, the use of medical imaging data suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
