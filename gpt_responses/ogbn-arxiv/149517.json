This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the computer vision sub-category. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): Lane localization and lane change detection are crucial in autonomous driving systems, which falls under the robotics sub-category. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses deep learning techniques to develop the computer vision system, which is a sub-field of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep residual neural network for lane change detection, which is a machine learning technique. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the primary focus of the paper, the proposed system could potentially contribute to the safety and security of autonomous driving systems, which falls under the cryptography and security sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
