The use of a POMDP and hindsight optimization also suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The focus on collaboration between humans and autonomous systems suggests that it may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories.
