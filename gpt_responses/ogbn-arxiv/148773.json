The paper uses computational methods to check the CCZ-inequivalent APN functions from infinite families on $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$ for n from 6 to 11. This involves the use of coding theory, cryptography, and algebraic geometry, which are all subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
