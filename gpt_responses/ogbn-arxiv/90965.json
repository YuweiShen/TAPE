The algorithms are based on data-oblivious techniques, which are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also presents new algorithms for graph problems, which are typically studied in the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
