The paper proposes a neural network model for sentence embeddings to determine the relevancy and degree of entailment for individual pieces of evidence to answer binary natural language questions. This falls under the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
