This involves using CNNs for 2D pose estimation and extending the resulting skeletons to 3D using sensor depth. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The system also involves real-time outcomes and tracking, which suggests it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics and Control). Additionally, the use of CNNs for pose estimation suggests it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia), and the system's ability to track multiple persons suggests it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the system's ability to work independently of background and initial pose suggests it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
