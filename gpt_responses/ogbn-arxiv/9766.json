The use of adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms is also a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes novel attack operations and detection schemes, which are related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
