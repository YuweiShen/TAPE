NMT is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), which falls under the computer science category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed methods involve exploring effective word or subword representations, which are related to language modeling (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of self-attention is also a common technique in NMT and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed methods on translation tasks, which can be considered a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) since it involves processing and understanding visual data (text)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
