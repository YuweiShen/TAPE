The use of CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder frameworks also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed 2D-CTC model involves adapting the CTC model to a second dimension, which could be seen as a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The experiments involve standard benchmarks for scene text recognition, which suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of deep learning and neural networks in the paper suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
