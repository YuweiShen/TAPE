The use of optimization programs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to mathematical optimization (cs.MA) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on logical frameworks suggests that it may also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
