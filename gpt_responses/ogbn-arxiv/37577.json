The paper also presents a proof method for verifying objects implemented in C11 and related models, which falls under the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper defines a correctness condition for concurrent objects using Lamport's execution structures, which is related to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also discusses weak-memory models that describe multicore memory systems, which is relevant to the Operating Systems (cs.OS) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the compositionality of linearizability, which is related to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
