The communication constraints and limited ability to communicate among agents suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the use of learning agents and fusion centers suggests that the paper may be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
