It also discusses the behavior of neural networks under stochastic gradient descent and the Neural Tangent Kernel. These topics are all closely related to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
