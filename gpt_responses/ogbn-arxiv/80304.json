The use of type formulas and the algorithm for computing principal types are related to type inference techniques commonly used in programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses complexity and expressive power, which are topics commonly studied in logic (cs.LO) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of polymorphism, which is a concept commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
