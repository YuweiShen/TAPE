The rule is designed to handle a large number of sources, which involves data management and processing, making it relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed rule on synthetic mass functions, which could fall under the category of simulation and modeling (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
