Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a new method for constructing a lightweight cost volume and recasting multi-view depth inference as an inverse depth regression task, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely categories. The paper also involves stereo matching, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
