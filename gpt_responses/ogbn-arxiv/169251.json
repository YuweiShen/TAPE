Therefore, cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.FP (Functional Programming) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with the organization of data structures, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the framework, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper deals with data structures, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
