The paper also discusses the use of beamforming and cognitive sensing, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new spectrum sharing paradigm, which involves the use of programmable physical layer drivers and beamforming engines, which are related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed system using experimental data, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
