The proposed method involves analyzing the surface morphology of the image, which is related to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of Linear Discriminant Analysis for classification suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
