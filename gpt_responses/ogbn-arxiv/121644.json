This involves analyzing the structure of the transformations and their metamodels. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of Software Engineering (cs.SE), Programming Languages (cs.PL), Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
