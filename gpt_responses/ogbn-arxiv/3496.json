The paper also proposes a natural and simple extension of the UCB family of algorithms for MAB, which is a popular algorithm in machine learning. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms for solving the exploration-exploitation tradeoff problem, which is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper also establishes interesting connections between this problem and other well-studied problems/algorithms such as the Blackwell approachability problem, online convex optimization, and the Frank-Wolfe technique for convex optimization. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with a general model for exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which is a fundamental problem in game theory. The paper also proposes algorithms for solving this problem, which can be applied to various game-theoretic scenarios. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a general model for exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence.
