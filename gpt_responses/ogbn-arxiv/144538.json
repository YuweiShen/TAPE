The use of random sampling and the analysis of expected number of violated constraints suggest that information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant sub-categories. Finally, the mention of LP-type problems and violator spaces suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
