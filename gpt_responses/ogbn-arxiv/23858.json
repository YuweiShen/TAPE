This falls under the broad category of machine learning, which is covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. Specifically, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are all relevant sub-categories that could potentially cover this paper. However, given the focus on ensemble selection and meta-learning, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
