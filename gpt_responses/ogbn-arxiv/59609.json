This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also relies on residual learning using ResNet50 architecture, which is a popular deep learning technique, indicating that it could also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The application of this framework to autonomous vehicles and drive-assistance systems suggests that it could also fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of images for policy-makers suggests that it could also fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
