The use of power control to optimize the transmission also falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The proposed approach of using deep neural networks for learning the optimal power level is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) and the application of this approach to video transmission also falls under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
