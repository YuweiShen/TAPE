Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization and mathematical modeling, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the use of millimeter-wave technology and the study of throughput could place the paper in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper mentions the use of graph theory and matching algorithms, which could relate to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
