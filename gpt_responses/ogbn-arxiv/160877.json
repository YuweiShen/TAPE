The paper introduces a new notion of transductive Rademacher complexity and a new notion of hypothesis set stability, which are both important concepts in machine learning. The paper also provides generalization bounds for data-dependent hypothesis sets, which is a common problem in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
