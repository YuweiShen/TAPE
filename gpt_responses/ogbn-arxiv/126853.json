The study aims to provide early warnings for fundraisers if their crowdfunding campaigns will eventually fail, which has implications for social welfare and equity. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the analysis of crowdfunding data, which can be seen as a type of social network where donors and fundraisers interact. The study proposes a deep learning model that combines time-series features and time-invariant features to predict fundraising performance, which is a typical problem in social network analysis. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a novel algorithm to predict fundraising performance in medical crowdfunding, which involves the development of software tools and techniques to process diverse sources of input data. The study also evaluates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to baseline models, which is a typical task in software engineering. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning model to predict fundraising performance in medical crowdfunding, which involves the use of neural networks to learn from diverse sources of input data. The study also evaluates the performance of the proposed model using standard metrics such as accuracy and precision, which are typical in machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
