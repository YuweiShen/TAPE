The use of tools for coarse-graining and identifying which coarse-grainings express an automaton's dynamics well suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The investigation of examples in Conway's Game of Life and Hopfield networks suggests a focus on discrete structures (cs.DS) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The formalization of the notion of emergent processes suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
