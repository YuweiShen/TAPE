However, the most relevant sub-category is likely to be Information Theory (cs.IT), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems and the design of efficient coding and modulation schemes. Other likely sub-categories include Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), which deals with the design and analysis of communication protocols and architectures, and Systems and Control (cs.SY), which deals with the modeling and control of complex systems. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM), which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia content, and Computer Communications (cs.COM), which deals with the design and analysis of communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
