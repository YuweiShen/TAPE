The use of precoding and spreading techniques also falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of space-time block codes (cs.MM) and their encoding/decoding using differential modulation. Finally, the paper proposes low complexity transceivers, which can be considered as a communication and networking topic (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
