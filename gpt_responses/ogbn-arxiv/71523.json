Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with wireless communication challenges, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper focuses on millimeter wave communication systems, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper employs deep learning tools, which could also place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
