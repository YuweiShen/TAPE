The use of threshold guards and domain-specific languages also suggests a connection to formal methods and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the use of LTL temporal specifications, which is a topic in logic and verification (cs.LO). The verification of safety and liveness properties is a common concern in distributed systems (cs.DS), and the use of model checking is a technique that is often used in systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
