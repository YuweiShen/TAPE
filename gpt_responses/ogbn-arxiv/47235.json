This falls under the category of machine learning. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): Face recognition is a common application in multimedia, and the paper specifically evaluates the proposed method on face recognition datasets. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of deep learning models for face recognition falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): While not the main focus of the paper, face recognition has implications for security and privacy, and the paper may touch on these topics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
