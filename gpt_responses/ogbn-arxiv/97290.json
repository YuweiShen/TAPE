These topics are commonly associated with the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also investigates human decision-making, which falls under the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper uses a resource-bounded objective, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
