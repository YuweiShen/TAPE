The optimization problem formulation and algorithmic solutions suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of efficient exact algorithms and estimators for calculating the objective function suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The evaluation of the proposed methods using synthetic and real data suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
