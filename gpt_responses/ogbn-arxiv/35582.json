Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses neural models, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another likely sub-category. The paper experiments with different NLI models, which could fall under cs.LG (Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper uses contextual embeddings, which could also fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it is a common technique in image processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
