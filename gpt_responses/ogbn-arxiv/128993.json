The use of ranking functions and priority queues also suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the discussion of lower bounds and optimality conjectures indicates a possible link to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
