The use of machine learning techniques for learning spatiotemporal relationships among joints also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of attention mechanisms to attend only to relevant areas in the video frames suggests that it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of relational cues in the spatial and temporal domains also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of 3D body pose tracking, 3D hand pose tracking, and 3D hand gesture tracking suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
