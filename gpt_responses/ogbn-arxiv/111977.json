Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the use of these alternatives in storage systems, which suggests the sub-category cs.DB (Databases). The paper mentions dynamic resizing and merging of the data structures, which falls under the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the performance of the data structures, which could fall under the sub-category cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
