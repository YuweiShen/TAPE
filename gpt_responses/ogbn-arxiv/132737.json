The approach involves object detection and classification using monocular images, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of end-to-end learning and semi-supervised label propagation involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of autonomous data collection capabilities of robots, which involves control systems and robotics (cs.SY). Finally, the experimental evaluation of the proposed approach involves measuring performance metrics, which falls under machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
