It also discusses the use of cloud computing and Simulation Software-as-a-Service (SimSaaS), which could be classified under \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) and \"Software Engineering\" (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the High Level Architecture (HLA) standard for interoperability among simulators, which could be classified under \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.Distributed). Finally, the paper discusses the need for a synergy among these technologies, which could be classified under \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
