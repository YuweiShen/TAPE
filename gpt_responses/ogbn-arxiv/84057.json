The paper also introduces new learning objectives for attention separability and cross-layer consistency, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the problem of visual confusion and the need for discriminative attention, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
