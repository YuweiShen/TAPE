This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses convolutional neural networks to estimate building condition from visual clues. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the artificial intelligence sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques (specifically, convolutional neural networks) to estimate building condition from visual clues. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning sub-category.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves extracting patterns from visual data to estimate building condition. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the information retrieval sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with visual data (i.e., exterior views of buildings) and proposes a method for assessing building condition from this data.
