Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves coding and decoding mechanisms, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper addresses practical issues such as timing and frequency synchronization, which is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses security issues related to the near-far problem, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves the deployment of a testbed of backscatter hardware, which is related to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
