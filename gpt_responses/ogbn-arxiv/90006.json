The proposed model uses regularization techniques to encourage disentanglement, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The model also leverages soft target representations to synthesize novel images, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
