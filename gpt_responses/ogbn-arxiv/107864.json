It also involves logic and formal methods, which could fall under categories such as cs.LO (logic in computer science) and cs.PL (programming languages). The use of priority graphs and their connection to prioritised bases suggests a possible connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the negative results regarding the representation of iterated belief revision using transformations on priority graphs could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
