The paper also uses a new algorithm for property testing of probability distributions as a key subroutine, which is a problem in information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
