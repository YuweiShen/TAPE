The paper proposes a novel module and a training scheme to improve the accuracy of text detection, which involves machine learning techniques, hence cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely sub-categories. The paper also involves natural language processing techniques, as it deals with text, hence cs.CL is a possible sub-category.
