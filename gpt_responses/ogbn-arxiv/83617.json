The paper focuses on wireless Internet service providers (ISPs) and their pricing plans, which falls under the category of networked and distributed systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the security implications of offloading and the need for secure offloading mechanisms, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper uses data obtained from mobile users and discusses the implementation of the system on Windows 7 tablets, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the bandwidth allocation mechanism used to enforce the assigned rate of each TCP application, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
