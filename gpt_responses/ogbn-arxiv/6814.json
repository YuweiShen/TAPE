The paper proposes a recursive algorithm for beam tracking in analog antenna arrays, which involves signal processing and optimization techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also discusses the challenges of serving fast-moving mobile terminals, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of mmWave technology and antenna arrays also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
