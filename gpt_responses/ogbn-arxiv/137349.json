The paper proposes a new architecture for modeling object-to-object relations in videos, which involves multi-stage reasoning and cascaded refinement. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as these fields are closely related to computer vision. Additionally, the paper involves object proposals and box linking, which are common techniques in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
