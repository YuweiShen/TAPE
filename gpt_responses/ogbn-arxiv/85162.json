This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a computationally efficient scheme that requires statistical channel knowledge, which could fall under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper analyzes the performance of the proposed scheme in general topologies, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
