The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with detecting objects in a wide area. The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with video analysis, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
