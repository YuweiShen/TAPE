Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization of camera designs for this specific task, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of soft prototyping and simulation tools also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
