It also involves the construction of drawings with good asymptotics, which is related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.GT). Additionally, the paper mentions open problems related to optimization and complexity, which could fall under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or algorithms (cs.AL). However, since the focus of the paper is on geometric aspects of graph embeddings, we consider cs.CG to be the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.DM, cs.DS, cs.GT, and cs.SI (which covers social and information networks, and could be relevant due to the study of graph embeddings)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
