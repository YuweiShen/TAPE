The paper also deals with formalizing defeasible arguments, which is a topic in logic and reasoning, making cs.LO a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses structured argumentation, which is a subfield of computational linguistics, making cs.CL a possible sub-category. The paper also deals with non-monotonic logic and reasoning, which is a topic in cryptography and security, making cs.CR a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the intricacies of reasoning with disjunctive information, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
