This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a new transceiver design for wireless communication systems using GFDM modulation. This falls under the domain of communications and networking.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of precoding to increase GFDM flexibility, which can be seen as a control system design problem.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a new modulation scheme and transceiver design for wireless communication systems, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses a new modulation scheme that can cover other waveforms in a single framework, which is relevant to multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
