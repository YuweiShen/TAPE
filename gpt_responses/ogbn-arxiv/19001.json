The paper also mentions upper and lower bounds on the conversion, which relates to the study of computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper discusses the removal of epsilon-transitions, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions average case descriptional complexity bounds, which relates to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
