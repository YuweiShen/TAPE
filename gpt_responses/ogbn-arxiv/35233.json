The paper also mentions the use of formal models based on mathematics and algorithms, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The concept of viewing development as a complex dynamical system suggests a potential fit with systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of robots to study the impact of changing the body on skill formation suggests a potential fit with neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
