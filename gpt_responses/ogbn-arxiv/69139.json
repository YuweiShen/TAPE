The paper also proposes a novel way of computing the post-equalization signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR), which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of soft-output minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection and the investigation of performance/complexity trade-offs suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
