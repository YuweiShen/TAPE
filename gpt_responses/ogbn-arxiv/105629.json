This involves the use of machine learning techniques such as unsupervised grammatical inference. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to Reinforcement Learning that involves the use of cognitive-inspired techniques to identify hierarchical task abstractions. This falls under the domain of Artificial Intelligence. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses unsupervised grammatical inference to identify hierarchical constituents in on-policy trajectories. This involves the use of natural language processing techniques and falls under the domain of Computation and Language. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed approach can be used to facilitate efficient imitation, transfer, and online learning, which are important in the domain of Robotics. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning architecture that can be used to learn hierarchical task abstractions efficiently.
