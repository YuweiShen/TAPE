This involves analyzing search queries and identifying topic changes. The methods proposed are based on a thesaurus and a classification system, which are typical knowledge organization systems in digital libraries. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Digital Libraries (cs.DL), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
