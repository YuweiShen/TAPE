The paper also discusses the use of receding-horizon planning and trajectory design, which are common topics in robotics. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the use of zonotopes for online planning, which is a topic in control theory and system identification, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) the second most likely category. The paper also discusses the use of simulations, which is a common topic in machine learning and computer vision, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) likely categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of planning algorithms, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
