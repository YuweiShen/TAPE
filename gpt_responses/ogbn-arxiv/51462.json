The paper also discusses the problem of unknown inputs and the need to reject false positives, which is a common issue in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The proposed novel loss functions are designed to modify deep feature space, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper experiments with datasets such as Devanagari and NotMNIST, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
