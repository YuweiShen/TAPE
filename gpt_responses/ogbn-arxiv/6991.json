It also proposes a Q-learning procedure to obtain an optimal hierarchy. The paper also mentions the use of the Hierarchy Of Abstract Machines (HAM) framework, which is commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence. \n\nThe paper is also likely to belong to the cs.RO sub-category as it mentions the design of efficient controllers for real robots using the HAM framework. \n\nThe cs.LG sub-category is also likely as the paper proposes a machine learning approach to learn the optimal hierarchy. \n\nThe cs.SY sub-category is also possible as the paper deals with the control of systems, specifically the control of robots using the HAM framework. \n\nFinally, the cs.MA sub-category is also possible as the paper proposes a method for automatic formation of the structure of abstract machines, which is relevant to the field of multi-agent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
