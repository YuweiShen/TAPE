The paper proposes a new concept called data polishing to clarify the groups by perturbating the data. This problem is closely related to the sub-categories of database systems (cs.DB), data mining (cs.DM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
