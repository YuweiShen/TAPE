This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The use of fixed gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying also suggests that the paper may belong to the networked systems (cs.NI) or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of Nakagami-m fading channels indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
