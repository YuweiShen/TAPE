The model also involves computation of pressure fields, which is related to mechanics (cs.ME) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of the model for design-in-simulation of robot controllers, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper could also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with the simulation of contact between objects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
