This involves optimizing the use of multiple antennas to minimize interference and improve detection probability. This work is likely to fall under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the design of precoding algorithms for MIMO cognitive radios, which involves optimizing the use of multiple antennas to improve communication performance. This is a key area of research in information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a dynamic spectrum access network where different types of radios coexist and share the same spectrum. This involves issues related to networking and internet architecture, such as interference management and resource allocation. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of proactive precoding algorithms that minimize interference and improve detection probability. This involves control and optimization techniques to ensure that the system operates within desired constraints. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the use of multiple antennas to improve communication performance in a dynamic spectrum access network. This is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and reliable transmission. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with the design of cognitive radio systems that coexist with primary users and employ spectrum sensing to avoid interference. This involves issues related to security and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
