Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to optimize the execution times and ciphertexts, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper proposes a scalable implementation for managing large user bases, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the paper discusses the design of the A-SKY system, which involves software engineering and system design, falling under the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
