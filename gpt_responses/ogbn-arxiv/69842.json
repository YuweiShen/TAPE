This falls under the category of electronic design automation (EDA) and computer-aided design (CAD), which are typically classified under cs.ET. The paper also involves graph coloring and semidefinite programming, which are relevant to cs.DS and cs.CG. Additionally, the paper may involve machine learning and computer vision techniques for pattern recognition, which are relevant to cs.CV.
