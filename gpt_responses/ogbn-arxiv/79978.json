The paper proposes a novel algorithm for learning intrinsic rewards for policy-gradient based learning agents, which falls under the category of deep reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm on Atari games and Mujoco domains, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
