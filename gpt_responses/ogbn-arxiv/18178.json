Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and VLAD encoding, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also deals with video surveillance, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia), and proposes a method for improving image representation, which could be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
