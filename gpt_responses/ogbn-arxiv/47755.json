The proposed solution involves developing a neural network architecture that accounts for the hardware constraints and learns beam codebooks that adapt to the surrounding environment and the user locations, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of beamforming codebooks in mmWave communication systems, which is a topic related to systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
