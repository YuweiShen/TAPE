The paper also involves the study of caching systems and their optimization, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The caching system studied in the paper involves communication networks, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also involves the study of information storage and retrieval, which is a topic in systems and information theory (cs.SI).
