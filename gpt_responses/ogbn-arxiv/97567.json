This problem is related to several areas of computer science, including databases (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of state-of-the-art data fusion techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning and data mining.
