The paper discusses the limitations of linear programming relaxations for this problem and provides lower bounds on the size of approximate formulations. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
