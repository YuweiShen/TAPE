The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms (LG) and computer vision (CV) in autonomous driving systems. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges of deploying autonomous driving systems, which involves systems and control (SY) techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.RO, and cs.LG. The next likely categories are cs.CV and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
