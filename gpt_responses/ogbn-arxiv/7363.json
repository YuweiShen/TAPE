This falls under the purview of discrete mathematics.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper involves analysis of strategies and policies for MDPs, which can be viewed as a form of logical reasoning. Additionally, the paper uses automata-theoretic methods, which are often studied in the context of logic in computer science.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): MDPs are a fundamental tool in reinforcement learning, a subfield of AI. The paper deals with computational complexity of MDP problems, which is relevant to AI researchers working on efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with control problems for MDPs, which is a topic of interest in systems and control theory. Additionally, the paper discusses a specific class of MDPs that are equivalent to a controlled extension of Quasi-Birth-Death processes, which are commonly studied in queueing theory and applied probability.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper involves automata-theoretic methods, which are often studied in the context of programming languages.
