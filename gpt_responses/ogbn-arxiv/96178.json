The use of MIMO technology and the study of channel matrices suggest that it could also belong to the sub-categories of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the optimization of MIMO operations, which could fall under Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
