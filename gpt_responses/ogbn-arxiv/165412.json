Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper uses proof nets, which are a graphical representation of proofs in linear logic, so cs.CT (Category Theory and Topology) and cs.PL (Programming Languages) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the classifying categories of SMC theories, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
