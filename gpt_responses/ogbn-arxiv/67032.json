Additionally, the paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach to solve this problem, which is a popular technique in the field of deep learning (cs.AI). The problem of trajectory forecasting is also relevant to the field of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY), as it is important for autonomous vehicles to be able to predict the future movements of other vehicles in order to make safe decisions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
