This is a common problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). The paper specifically focuses on Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (ADCOPs), which fall under the category of Distributed Constraint Optimization (cs.DC). The proposed algorithm involves using a tailored inference algorithm, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and System Theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
