This involves the manipulation of data streams to misclassify events, which is a common problem in cybersecurity (cs.CR). The paper proposes a defense mechanism to robustify the performance of the event cause analysis, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The study also involves the vulnerability assessment of the event cause analysis with respect to the number of compromised measurements, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper uses real-time digital simulator (RTDS) data to study the effectiveness of adversarial attacks under different scenarios, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
