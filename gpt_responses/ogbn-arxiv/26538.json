The paper also makes use of human behavior and social structure to predict links, which suggests a connection to social networks (cs.SOC) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a third-order tensor to organize spatio-temporal aspects of node behavior suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on predicting links in wireless networks suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
