The paper also discusses the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of the network, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also discusses the transferability of features between different datasets and tasks, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
