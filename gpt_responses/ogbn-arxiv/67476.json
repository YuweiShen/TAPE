The paper proposes a new model for zero-shot grounding, which involves predicting classification scores and regression parameters for novel, unseen nouns. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. However, the paper also deals with the challenge of generating appropriate proposals for zero-shot grounding, which involves training on entities that are not present in the detection and grounding datasets. This suggests that the paper may also be classified under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper introduces new datasets for evaluation, which suggests that it may be classified under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves training a single-stage model that combines the detector network and the grounding system, which suggests that it may also be classified under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Overall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
