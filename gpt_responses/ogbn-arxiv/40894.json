The paper also discusses the use of coding theory to achieve reliable communications, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The proposed early-detection scheme involves sequential testing, which is a technique used in statistical inference and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the reduction of error probability, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a method to reduce latency, which is a topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
