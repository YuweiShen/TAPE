The paper discusses the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus, which is a large corpus of 433k examples that covers ten distinct genres of written and spoken English. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of cross-genre domain adaptation, which could also place it in the sub-categories of Computation and Language (cs.CC) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
