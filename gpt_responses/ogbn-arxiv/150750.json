Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning, which suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of 3D lights and geometric parameters suggests the category cs.GR (Computer Graphics). The paper also involves regression, which suggests the category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves compositing, which suggests the category cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
