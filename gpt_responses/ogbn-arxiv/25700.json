Therefore, cs.CL and cs.CV are likely categories. The paper also proposes a mechanism to guide the model towards more compositional solutions, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two tasks, which involves training and testing the model on different distributions, indicating a focus on generalization and robustness, which are important topics in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
