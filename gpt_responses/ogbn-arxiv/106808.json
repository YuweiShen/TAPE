This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with issues related to wireless networks and communication, which suggests that it could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the problem of detecting an Invader who wants to utilize spectrum undetected, which suggests that it could belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also deals with the problem of optimizing scanning strategies, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category.
