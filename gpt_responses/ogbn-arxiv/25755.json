The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques to improve summarization, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves ranking and weighting of systems, which could be categorized under cs.LG (Learning). Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for summarization aggregation, which could be considered under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
