The paper also discusses cooperative communication protocols, which are commonly used in wireless networks (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper presents results for multi-source multi-sink networks, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The evaluation of degrees of freedom in single-source multi-sink networks involves the use of linear algebra and optimization techniques, which are relevant to the field of machine learning and optimization (cs.MM) and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
