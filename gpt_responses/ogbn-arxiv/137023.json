Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. The paper also discusses the use of neural network-based acoustic models, which falls under cs.SD (Sound), and the comparison of different ASR features, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper focuses on developing a speaker-independent ASR system, which could be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
