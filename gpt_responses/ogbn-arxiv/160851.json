This involves using mathematical equations to represent the value function and policy mappings, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also applies the proposed method to control problems, which falls under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper compares the proposed method to neural networks, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
