The paper focuses on optimizing resource allocation among jobs with various demands, which is a common problem in data-intensive computing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). \n\nThe paper also discusses the importance of efficient scheduling algorithms for system performance, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes a new scheduling strategy that involves dynamically adjusting the reserved ratio of resources based on pending requests and release patterns of running jobs. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.PF (Performance) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also mentions limited knowledge about execution length of running jobs and incoming jobs' resource demands, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the classification of jobs into two categories based on their requests, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
