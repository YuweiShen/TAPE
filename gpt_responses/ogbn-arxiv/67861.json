It also discusses the free model of the theory, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO). The paper presents a new treatment for exception handling, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the generalization of exception handlers to arbitrary algebraic effects, which is a topic in formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper includes examples from both theory and practice, which suggests a possible connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
