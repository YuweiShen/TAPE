The paper also discusses the weaknesses of current methods for detecting fraudulent behavior, which could be considered a security issue (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed algorithm has theoretical underpinnings and is evaluated on real data, which suggests that it could fall under the category of social influence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
