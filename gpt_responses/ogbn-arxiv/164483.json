Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the delay and energy efficiency of the proposed scheme, which suggests that it could be relevant to categories such as cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.GR (Graphics), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the proposed algorithm for AR/VR wireless transmission could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
