The use of antenna selection and space-time transmission also falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The asymptotic analysis of the probability of zero secrecy capacity involves system and control theory (cs.SY), while the evaluation of the performance of different schemes involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the transmission of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
