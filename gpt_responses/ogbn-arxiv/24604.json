The paper proposes an algorithm and provides performance guarantees for the regret evaluated against the optimal non-stationary policy. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
