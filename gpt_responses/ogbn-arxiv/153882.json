The use of a monocular vision system for gesture recognition suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of considering human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the design of the system. Finally, the practical implementation of the system in an aerial robot suggests that systems and control (cs.SY) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
