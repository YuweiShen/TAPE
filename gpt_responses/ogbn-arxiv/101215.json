Therefore, it is likely to be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a simple method based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) that achieves near state-of-the-art performance on mean rank (MR), which suggests that it could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper conducts analyses to highlight implicit dataset biases and effects of over-constrained evaluation metrics, which could make it relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
