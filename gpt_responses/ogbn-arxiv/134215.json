The paper discusses deep learning models for question answering on images, tables, and passages of text, which are all subfields of computer science. Specifically, the paper analyzes the behavior of these models using the notion of attribution and perturbs questions to craft adversarial examples. This falls under computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
