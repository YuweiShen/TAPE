The paper also discusses the use of synthetic images to fool these networks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the security implications of these vulnerabilities, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses mathematical techniques to perturb images, which could also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
