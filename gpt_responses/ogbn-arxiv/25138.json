The paper specifically focuses on the use of self-calibration, compressive sensing, and biconvex optimization to address this problem. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), computer vision (cs.CV), signal processing (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories that this paper belongs to, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
