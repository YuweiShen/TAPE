This involves the use of convex criteria and multiple sensor models. The paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category as it deals with optimization and resource allocation. It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it involves classification and estimation. The paper could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category as it deals with sensor models and allocation. Finally, it could belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category as it involves locating targets in a large space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
