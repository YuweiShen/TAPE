The use of lattice decoding also suggests a potential connection to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The mention of computational complexity and polynomial time complexity suggests a possible connection to the algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the comparison to pilot-assisted transmission suggests a potential connection to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
