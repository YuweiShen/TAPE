The focus is on reducing latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees, which is a key concern in distributed computing. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the security guarantees of permissioned blockchains and proposes a new design that maintains these guarantees while reducing latency. The focus is on secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases, such as supply chain management and banking. \n\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a new design for permissioned blockchains that eliminates blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This makes StreamChain a potential alternative to traditional databases, and enables further research around reducing latency through relying on modern hardware in datacenters. \n\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the importance of fast networking in permissioned blockchains deployed in datacenter-like environments. The proposed design is optimized for low-latency networking, which is a key concern in this sub-category. \n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new data structure for permissioned blockchains that eliminates blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This requires new algorithms for"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
