This falls under the domain of information theory.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on secure communication in the presence of unknown eavesdroppers, and proposes a beamforming design to maximize the artificial noise power. This is a key aspect of cryptography and security.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper considers the joint design of beamforming and power splitting ratio for multiple users, and incorporates a non-linear energy harvesting model. This involves system modeling and control aspects.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not deal with multimedia directly, but the MISO system considered can be used for multimedia transmission.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper does not deal with networking or internet architecture directly, but the proposed beamforming design can be used in wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
