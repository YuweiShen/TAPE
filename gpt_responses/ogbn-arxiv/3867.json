The proposed model also utilizes attention-based graph reasoning to generate hierarchical textual embeddings, which is a common technique in computer vision.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with text disentanglement and hierarchical semantic graph, which are common topics in natural language processing. The proposed model also utilizes attention-based graph reasoning to generate hierarchical textual embeddings, which is a common technique in natural language processing.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with video-text retrieval, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed model also aims to improve fine-grained video-text retrieval, which is a common goal in information retrieval.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with cross-modal retrieval between videos and texts, which is a common problem in multimedia. The proposed model also utilizes attention-based graph reasoning to generate hierarchical textual embeddings, which is a common technique in multimedia.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new model for video-text retrieval, which is a common problem in machine learning.
