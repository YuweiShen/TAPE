It also involves the use of different attack methods and datasets, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the datasets used are image-based and involve image classification tasks. The use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) may also suggest a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial attacks, which is a topic of interest in the broader field of AI. Finally, the use of attack methods and the analysis of the models' resilience may suggest a connection to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
