The use of polar varieties and the complexity analysis suggest that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) or cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The practical experiments and the mention of numeric techniques suggest that it could also be classified under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The mention of regularity assumptions and the decision-making aspect suggest that it could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
