This falls under the domain of robotics, making cs.RO the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with system model identification in an active setting, where the vehicle autonomously decides what actions to take. This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY the second most likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to approximate the belief dynamics of the system around a candidate trajectory. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses sampling-based motion planning to explore the space of possible beliefs and find a maximally informative trajectory within a user-defined budget. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not the main focus of the paper, the multirotor MAV may use computer vision for navigation and obstacle avoidance. This makes cs.CV a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
