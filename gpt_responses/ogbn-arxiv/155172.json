The focus is on achieving the optimal Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) for a Broadcast Channel (BC) under noisy, yet distributed, CSIT. This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a transmission scheme for a network MIMO channel, which involves multiple transmitters and receivers. This falls under the purview of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the design of a transmission scheme for a network MIMO channel, which involves multiple transmitters and receivers. This falls under the purview of social and information networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of a transmission scheme for a network MIMO channel, which involves multiple transmitters and receivers. This could have applications in multimedia communication. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of a transmission scheme for a network MIMO channel, which involves multiple transmitters and receivers. This could have applications in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
