The use of deep learning models such as U-Net suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method on the BRATS 2015 dataset indicates that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
