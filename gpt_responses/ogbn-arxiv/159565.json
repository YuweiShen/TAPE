The technique involves working with LLVM, which is a compiler infrastructure, and performing slicing on its intermediate representation (IR), which falls under programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the technique, which involves data analysis and optimization, falling under machine learning (cs.LG) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of symbolic execution, which falls under computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
