The paper also discusses clustering and thresholding techniques, which are commonly used in graph theory and computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of a novel metric to quantify the impact of natural disasters suggests that the paper may also fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite imagery falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
