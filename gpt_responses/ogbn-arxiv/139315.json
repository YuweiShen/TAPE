The paper also presents a low complexity decoding algorithm, which involves processing and exchanging messages between different units, making it relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and networked communication (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed codes in optical transport networks, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
