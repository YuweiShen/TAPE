This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of a single parameter to describe multiple types of lane changes, which can be seen as a form of machine learning or artificial intelligence.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on modeling the behavior of vehicles on the road could be relevant to robotics applications such as autonomous vehicles.\n- cs.LG (Learning): The paper's discussion of the use of a single parameter to describe multiple types of lane changes could also be seen as a form of machine learning or learning in general.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper's use of empirical data and validation could be relevant to computational engineering or science applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
