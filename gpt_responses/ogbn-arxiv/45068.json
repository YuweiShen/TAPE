The paper also focuses on noise-tolerant learning, which is a subfield of machine learning and can be categorized under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). The use of comparisons as an additional type of query is a unique approach and can be related to \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it involves designing efficient algorithms. The paper also mentions the application of the proposed algorithms in computer vision tasks, which falls under \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the reliability guarantee provided by the use of comparisons, which can be related to \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks) as it involves analyzing the performance of the algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
