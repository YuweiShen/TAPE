This involves modeling the integration using multi-view graph auto-encoders and adding an attentive mechanism to determine the weights for each view. This work involves machine learning, graph modeling, and natural language processing, which are all relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)\n- cs.DB (Databases)\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
