Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes an efficient algorithm, which suggests that it could belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world data, indicating that it could also belong to the statistical learning (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
