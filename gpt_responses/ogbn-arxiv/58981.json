The paper focuses on bridging the gap between the two tiers of a typical blockchain application, which involves modelling data schema and embedding business rules into the blockchain using smart contracts, and implementing client-side application logic using the SDK provided by HLF. This work involves aspects of distributed computing (cs.DC), security and privacy (cs.CR), software engineering (cs.SE), databases (cs.DB), and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
