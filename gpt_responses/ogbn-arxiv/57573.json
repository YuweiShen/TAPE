The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on improving the coverage in correcting grammatical errors suggests that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the use of character N-gram information suggests that it could belong to cs.CY (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
