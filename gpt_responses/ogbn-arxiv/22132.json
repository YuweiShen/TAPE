The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of the model, which falls under the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). As the paper deals with forensic analysis of images, it can also be categorized under the subfield of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of scraped data from the web for experiments suggests the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the use of deep learning models for classification tasks falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
