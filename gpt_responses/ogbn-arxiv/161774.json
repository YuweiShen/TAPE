The method is specifically designed to handle rich sensory observations, such as camera images, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision) and \"cs.RO\" (Robotics). The paper also mentions the use of nonlinear function approximators such as convolutional neural networks, which is a common technique in \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
