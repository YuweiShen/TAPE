This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves a new convolution operation on regular size feature maps, which could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper introduces a new approach to GCN architecture, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
