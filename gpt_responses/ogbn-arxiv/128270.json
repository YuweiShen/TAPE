This falls under the domain of robotics and hence cs.RO is the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The proposed framework involves the use of visual data for state estimation, which falls under the domain of computer vision. Hence, cs.CV is a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control and coordination of multiple UAVs, which falls under the domain of systems and control. Hence, cs.SY is a likely sub-category. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with the collaboration of multiple UAVs, which falls under the domain of multi-agent systems. Hence, cs.MA is a likely sub-category. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper involves the use of Ultra-WideBand (UWB) for state estimation, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. Hence, cs.NI is a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
