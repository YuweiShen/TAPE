The paper also mentions the use of additional prediction heads and regularization, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the separation of hidden feature space, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on the MS COCO dataset, which is a common benchmark dataset in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
