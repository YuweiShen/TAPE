The paper also proposes a Micro-Operational Design Domain approach, which involves using probabilistic methods to improve safety, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, which is a topic in networking (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of cameras and sensors, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of mathematical models to prove safety, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
