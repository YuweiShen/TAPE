Therefore, cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves triangularization methods, which are commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the Hermite normal form has applications in control theory (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
