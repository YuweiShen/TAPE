The paper proposes an approach to generate abstractive summaries by fusing important content from several utterances using an integer linear programming-based sentence fusion approach. This involves techniques such as dependency graph fusion, which are commonly used in NLP and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Other possible sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
