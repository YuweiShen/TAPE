This is a common problem in computer vision, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes two new methods for modeling temporal appearance and enriching feature representation, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates its method on the ImageNet VID dataset, which is commonly used in multimedia research, suggesting that it may belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on video object detection suggests that it may also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category, as this is a common application area for video object detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
