This involves numerical simulations and analysis of the microstructural variations in the final parts. Therefore, cs.CE is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a high-order parallel Finite Cell Method for the numerical analysis of the microstructures in the CT-scans of the additively manufactured parts. This involves developing software tools and algorithms for efficient mesh generation and material characterization. Therefore, cs.MS is another likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the analysis of complex microarchitectured structures, which involves geometric modeling, mesh generation, and analysis of surface roughness and other morphological discrepancies. Therefore, cs.CG is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the use of computer tomographic images of 3D printed components for material characterization analysis. This involves processing and analyzing large amounts of image data, which can be considered as multimedia content. Therefore, cs.MM is another possible sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves the analysis of CT-scans of additively manufactured parts to extract"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
