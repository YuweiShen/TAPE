Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also compares the performance of these embeddings with cutting-edge monolingual models, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the ability of these embeddings to capture ontological status, which could relate to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
