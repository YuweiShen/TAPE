Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions deep learning (DL) and compressed vectors, which are related to natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), respectively. Hence, cs.CL and cs.CV are also likely sub-categories. Moreover, the paper proposes a new approach for optimizing accuracy, latency, and memory, which involves collaborative optimization and multiview processing, indicating that it may be relevant to optimization (LG) and database (DB) subfields as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
