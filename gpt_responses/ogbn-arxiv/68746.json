The focus is on constructing a sparse suffix tree, which is relevant in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DM) applications where only a subset of interesting suffixes need to be stored. The algorithm also involves lexicographic sorting and merging of suffixes, which are common operations in computational geometry (cs.CG) and combinatorial algorithms (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
