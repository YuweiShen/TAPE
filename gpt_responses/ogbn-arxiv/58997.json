The paper also discusses the impact of unit attributes such as class selectivity and weight L1 norm on overall accuracy, which are key topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the impact of batch normalization and dropout, which are common techniques in neural network optimization and regularization, respectively, and are relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
