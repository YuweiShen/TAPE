Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of Convolutional LSTMs, which are a type of recurrent neural network, indicating that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories.
