This suggests a strong connection to logic in computer science. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with termination in the context of a lambda calculus with general recursion, which is a core topic in programming languages. The use of termination casts to implement terminating recursion is also a programming language concept. \n- cs.TL (Type Theory): The paper proposes a type-and-effect system that distinguishes terminating terms and total functions from possibly diverging terms and partial functions, which is a central concern in type theory. The inclusion of a primitive type-form \"Terminates t\" is also a type-theoretic concept. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with the termination of computations in a lambda calculus, which can be seen as a formal language. The translation to a logical theory of termination also suggests a connection to automata theory. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a flexible approach to termination that allows for terminating recursion using termination casts. This is a practical concern in software engineering, where ensuring termination is important for program correctness and efficiency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
