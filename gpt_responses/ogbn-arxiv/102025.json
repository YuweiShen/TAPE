These topics are typically studied in the information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MM) communities. The paper also discusses the use of Gel'fand-Pinsker binning, which is a technique commonly used in source coding (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper considers the Gaussian case, which is relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
