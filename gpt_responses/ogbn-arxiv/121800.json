It specifically focuses on partially coherent channels, which are commonly found in fiber optics (cs.OH, cs.PH). The paper also discusses the effects of nonlinearities in fiber-optic channels, which is a topic in nonlinear optics (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses numerical simulations and analytical expressions, which are common tools in computational mathematics (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
