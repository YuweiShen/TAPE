This aligns with the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of data-driven theories, which could fall under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The mention of \"cyber\" in the cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) sub-category could be related to the use of computational tools to analyze labor market data. Finally, the paper mentions the use of a complexity measure, which could fall under the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
