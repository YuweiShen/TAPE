It leverages Golay complementary sequences in the preamble of a single-carrier (SC) physical layer (PHY) frame as a radar waveform. The paper also discusses the integration of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and LRR based on a mmWave consumer wireless local area network (WLAN) standard. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of Golay complementary sequences for radar waveform, which is a topic related to signal processing and information theory.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes an IEEE 802.11ad-based radar system for vehicular communication, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the integration of V2V communication and LRR, which is a topic related to systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes radar processing algorithms for target detection, range, and velocity estimation, which may involve machine learning techniques.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mmWave radar for LRR applications in vehicles, which is a topic related to multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
