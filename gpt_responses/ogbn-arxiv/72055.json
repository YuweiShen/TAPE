The proposed method uses total variation regularization, which is a common technique in optimization (cs.Optimization) and signal processing (cs.IT). The paper also mentions the use of iterative algorithms, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper compares its method with other state-of-the-art methods, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
