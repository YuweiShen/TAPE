The paper also discusses the use of deep learning and learning-based methods, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of multi-scale convolutional features, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between runtime and quality, which is a common concern in optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
