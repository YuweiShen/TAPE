The use of deep learning methods also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of PnP and RANSAC for pose estimation suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the method on both synthetic and real training data suggests that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
