It also involves the use of involution, which is a concept in formal languages (cs.FL) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper may also be relevant to the study of computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS) as it involves analyzing the size of the alphabet and the structure of infinite words."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
