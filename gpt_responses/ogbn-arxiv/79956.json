This is a classic problem in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS), which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also deals with collision avoidance, connectivity maintenance, and convergence to desired destinations, which are all related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a systematic way to search for an optimal Lyapunov-like barrier function, which involves optimization techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
