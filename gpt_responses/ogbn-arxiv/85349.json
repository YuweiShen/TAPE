This involves designing a query language to model the structure and semantics of code as logic facts, and using active inductive logic programming to infer new queries based on user feedback. This work involves aspects of software engineering (cs.SE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), programming languages (cs.PL), machine learning (cs.LG), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
