The paper specifically addresses issues with the backpropagation algorithm, which is commonly used in deep learning, and proposes a new learning method that generalizes Equilibrium Propagation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the approximation of the true gradient, which is related to optimization and machine learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of recurrent networks and vector field dynamics could also suggest a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
