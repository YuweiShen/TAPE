The paper describes the document vectorization and sentiment score prediction techniques used, which are common techniques used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) fields. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the study of computational models for various linguistic tasks, including sentiment analysis. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the study of techniques and algorithms for retrieving relevant information from large collections of data, including text data. Sentiment analysis can be seen as a sub-task of information retrieval. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data and make predictions. Sentiment analysis is a common application of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, including natural language understanding and sentiment analysis. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category deals with the study of the computational resources required to solve computational problems, including those related to NLP and ML"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
