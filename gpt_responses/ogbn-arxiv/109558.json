The focus is on linear models, which are widely used in many applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and finance. The paper proposes a general optimization framework for creating explanations for linear models, which involves decomposing the model into a sequence of models of increasing complexity. This approach is relevant to optimization and computational engineering (cs.CE), as well as cryptography and security (cs.CR), since it can help to expose hidden biases and reduce vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between interpretability and predictive accuracy, which is a fundamental issue in data science and statistics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
