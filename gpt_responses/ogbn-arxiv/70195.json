This suggests that the paper could belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses ML algorithms, model structures, and training/serving data, indicating that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions non-IID data partitions, which suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper discusses ML training over facial images, indicating that it could belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses low-latency and low-cost ML serving, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
