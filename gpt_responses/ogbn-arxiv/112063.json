This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on cognitive radio networks (cs.CR) and proposes a novel binary inference algorithm for primary user separation. The algorithm involves modeling observations as boolean OR mixtures, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results, which could be considered as a form of system evaluation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
