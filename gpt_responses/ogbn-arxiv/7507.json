This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the receiver architecture and channel modeling, which are relevant to communication systems (cs.COMM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical analysis and concentration results, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
