The paper also discusses hyperparameter tuning and optimization, which are topics in machine learning (ML) and could fall under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. Additionally, the paper uses BERT, which is a popular NLP model and could also fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The paper also mentions achieving state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD, which are NLP benchmarks and could fall under the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category.
