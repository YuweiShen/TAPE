This topic falls under the category of networked and internet-based systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses signal processing techniques such as wavelet-based methods and compressive sensing, which are relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper addresses challenges and limitations in cognitive radio networks, which is a topic in computer networks and communications (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
