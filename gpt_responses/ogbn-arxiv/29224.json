This involves the study of channel polarization phenomenon and the optimal choice of bit labeling. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also includes simulation results for the AWGN channel, indicating its relevance to the cs.COMM (Communications) category. The study of channel polarization and the use of coding schemes suggest a possible fit with the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) categories. Finally, the use of digital PAM modulation suggests a possible fit with the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
