This fits well within the scope of cs.PL.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with contextual equivalence, which is a concept from semantics and logic. The use of lambda calculus and recursion also suggests a logical approach. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with probabilistic programming, which is a subfield of AI. The use of continuous random variables and scoring also suggests a focus on AI applications. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with probabilistic programming, which involves the manipulation of probabilities and information. The use of scoring and recursion also suggests a connection to information theory. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a language that includes recursion and fixpoint combinators, which are concepts from systems and control theory. The use of continuous random variables and scoring also suggests a connection to control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
