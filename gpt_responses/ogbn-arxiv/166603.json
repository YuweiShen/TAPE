The use of policy reinforcement learning and heuristic uncertainty-based methods suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The experiments conducted on image datasets such as MNIST and MNIST-M suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
