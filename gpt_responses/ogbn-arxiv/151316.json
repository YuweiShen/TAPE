The paper proposes an optimization objective for learning reusable temporally extended actions (macros) and introduces a computationally tractable surrogate objective for finding such macros. The paper also proposes an exploration strategy that takes advantage of these macros. Given these factors, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
