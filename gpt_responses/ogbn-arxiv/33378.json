The paper also presents a new formulation for the problem using Gaussian integers, which is a topic that falls under signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the structure of Voronoi regions, which is a topic that falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and cryptography (cs.CR). However, since the paper focuses more on the theoretical aspects of the problem rather than practical implementation, the sub-categories related to theory (cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SI, cs.CR) are more likely than those related to implementation (cs.MM, cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
