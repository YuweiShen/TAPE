This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically involves computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) tasks. The experiments involve image retrieval (cs.MM) and the proposed method involves ensembles of embedding functions, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
