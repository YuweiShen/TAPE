The paper focuses on the design and implementation of the robot, as well as the interpretation of wing loading feedback to detect environmental changes. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.ROB (Robotics and Automation), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
