The paper discusses two modeling approaches for UNLI and uses existing categorically labeled NLI data for pre-training. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
