The use of heuristic search-based algorithms also suggests a connection to optimization and combinatorial algorithms (cs.DM). The focus on finding high-quality solutions quickly and improving incumbent solutions aligns with the subfield of anytime algorithms (cs.SY). Finally, the use of Bayesian networks involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
