The use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is also a common technique in these fields. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques, such as structural modifications and expression sharing, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with the problem of weakly supervised classification, which is a common problem in the sub-categories of cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
