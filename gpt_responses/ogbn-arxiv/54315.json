Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper specifically focuses on image models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper proposes a new technique for selecting training examples, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves optimization and efficiency, which could also place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
