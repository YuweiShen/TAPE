This makes it relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures (cs.DS), and programming languages (cs.PL). However, since the paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the logic and its expressiveness, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
