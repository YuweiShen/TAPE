Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of Receptive Field Blocks (RFB), which is a technique used in deep learning models. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
