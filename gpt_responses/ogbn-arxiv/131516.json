It may also fall under the category of \"Information Retrieval\" (cs.IR) as NER is an important component of information retrieval systems. Additionally, the use of neural word embedding algorithms such as SKIP-gram, CBOW, and GloVe suggests that this paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Finally, the focus on named entity recognition specifically may suggest that this paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
