This involves utilizing features in the latest MPI standards such as passive-target remote memory access, shared-memory window creation, and atomic read-modify-write operations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves computational performance optimization, which could place it in the Performance (cs.PF) sub-category. The paper also deals with distributed systems, which could place it in the Distributed Systems (cs.Distributed Systems) sub-category. The paper involves programming language constructs such as loops, which could place it in the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of novel features in MPI, which could place it in the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
