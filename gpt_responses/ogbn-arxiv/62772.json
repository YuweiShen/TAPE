It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a novel scheme to train binary CNNs. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it aims to improve the accuracy of binary CNNs. The paper also involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it proposes a method to approximate full-precision weights with binary weight bases. Finally, it involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it evaluates the performance of the proposed method on image datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
