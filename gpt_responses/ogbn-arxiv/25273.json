This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the focus of the paper is on the application of machine learning to theorem proving, we believe that cs.LO and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SE, cs.PL, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
