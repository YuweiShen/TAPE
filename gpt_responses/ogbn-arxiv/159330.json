Specifically, the paper discusses intrinsically analyzing the corpora based on contextual similarities, question types, and answer categories, as well as extrinsically analyzing them for answer retrieval, selection, and triggering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which are all related to NLP and machine learning. Additionally, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CY (Computers and Society) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper discusses statistical question answering learning and the use of corpora for this purpose."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
