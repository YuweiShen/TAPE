These topics fall under formal languages and automata theory.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper involves proving a conjecture about the upper bound of the length of shortest reset words in Eulerian automata, which requires logical reasoning.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves the study of automata and their properties, which can be seen as a type of data structure. Additionally, the paper involves finding an extremal series of automata, which can be seen as an algorithmic problem.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not directly involve computational complexity, but the study of automata and their properties can be related to computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
