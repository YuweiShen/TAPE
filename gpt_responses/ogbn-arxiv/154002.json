The proposed method does not rely on pre-designed structures, which suggests a potential contribution to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed detector using datasets, which indicates a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
