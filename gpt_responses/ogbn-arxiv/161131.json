This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). However, given the focus on cryptography and security, cs.CR is the most likely sub-category. The use of computer vision techniques also suggests cs.CV as a likely sub-category. The focus on user-friendliness and ease of deployment suggests cs.HC as a possible sub-category. The potential societal implications of the framework could also make cs.CY a relevant sub-category. Finally, the use of cryptographic primitives in the context of real-world interactions could also make cs.SI a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
