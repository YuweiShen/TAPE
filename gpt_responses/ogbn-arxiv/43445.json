Specifically, the paper introduces a new notion of probabilistic rank and sign-rank for matrices, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
