This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as image processing and feature extraction, as well as graphics (GR) techniques such as 3D modeling and rendering. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the paper involves the use of real-time performance, which could fall under multimedia (MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
