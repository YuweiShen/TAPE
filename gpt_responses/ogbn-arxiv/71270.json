The proposed solution does not require inter-device communication, which could also place it in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. The use of feedback signals and cost functions suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. The optimization aspect of the paper could also place it in the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. Finally, the empirical analysis and comparison of algorithms could suggest that it belongs to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
