The proposed algorithm relies on fast linear algebra, which suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of scientific computing (cs.SC). The use of linear algebra also suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) could be a relevant sub-category. The paper also proposes new algorithms, which could make it relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of linear algebra in computational geometry (cs.CG) is also a possibility. Finally, the paper deals with the solution of systems of equations, which could make it relevant to the sub-category of control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
