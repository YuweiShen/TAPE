The focus on correlated sources and the use of entropy functions suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of network information theory (cs.NI) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The mention of auxiliary random variables and the use of implicit and explicit outer bounds suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
