The paper specifically addresses the issue of reducing the number of off-chip memory accesses during training and inference, which is a key component of the energy needs of DNN accelerators. This suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category, as DNNs are commonly used in image recognition tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the accuracy impact of their pruning technique, which is a key concern in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a new algorithm for constraining the total number of weights updated during backpropagation, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of their technique on network architectures such as Densenet and WRN, which suggests that data structures (cs.DS) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
