This involves analyzing the spatial separation of users and quantifying the impact of different parameters on the mutual orthogonality of channels. Information theory is closely related to the study of communication channels and their capacity, making this category a likely fit. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a statistical millimeter wave (mmwave) MIMO channel simulator, which is a key component in wireless networking and communication systems. The investigation of multi-user channels and their spatial separation is also relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of mmwave frequencies in the channel simulator and the potential impact of human/vehicular mobility on communication links may have implications for multimedia applications such as video streaming and virtual reality. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The study of channel models and their impact on communication systems can be seen as a systems and control problem. The paper also discusses the impact of different parameters on the degree of orthogonality of channels, which can be viewed as a control problem. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The investigation of multi-user channels and their spatial separation can be seen as a problem in multi"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
