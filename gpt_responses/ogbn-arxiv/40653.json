The use of an out-of-band relay channel is also relevant to spectrum sharing and cognitive radio (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the impact of channel parameters on the achievable rates, which is related to machine learning and optimization (cs.MM), and the design of achievable schemes, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
