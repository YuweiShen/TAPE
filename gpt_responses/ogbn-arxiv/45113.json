It could also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves generating new shapes. The use of conditional generative modeling suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves learning a one-to-many mapping, which is a common problem in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
