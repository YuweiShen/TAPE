This involves utilizing images to predict blockage effects and trigger handovers in a proactive manner. The paper also uses deep reinforcement learning to learn the optimal mapping between images and handover decisions. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with handover decision-making in mmWave networks, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses images from multiple cameras to predict blockage effects, which involves computer vision techniques. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep reinforcement learning to learn the optimal mapping between images and handover decisions, which falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's use of deep reinforcement learning also falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed framework in terms of channel capacity, which falls under the scope of information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
