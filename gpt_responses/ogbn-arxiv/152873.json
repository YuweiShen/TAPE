This falls under the purview of Information Theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper studies the delay and AoI in a multiple access channel (MAC) with two source nodes transmitting different types of data to a common destination. This falls under the purview of Networking and Internet Architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the performance of a system with two source nodes and a common destination.
