The paper also discusses the angular resolution of the drawings, which is related to graph drawing and visualization (cs.GT). The use of convex drawings and the proof of the existence of strongly monotone drawings also involve combinatorial and algorithmic aspects (cs.DM). Finally, the paper mentions the concept of embeddings, which is a topic in computational topology and graph theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
