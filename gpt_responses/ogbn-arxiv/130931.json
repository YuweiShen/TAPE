This falls under the domain of robotics and hence cs.RO is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses RGB camera data for object pose estimation, which is a common application of computer vision. Hence, cs.CV is also a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning model for self-determination of reliability values of each modality. This falls under the domain of machine learning and hence cs.LG is also a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a deep learning model for object pose estimation, which is a common application of artificial intelligence. Hence, cs.AI is also a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of a robot gripper for in-hand manipulation, which falls under the domain of systems and control. Hence, cs.SY is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
