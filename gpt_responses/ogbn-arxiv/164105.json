The use of small messages and the focus on communication complexity suggests a possible categorization in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the use of approximation algorithms and the analysis of their performance suggests a possible categorization in algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
