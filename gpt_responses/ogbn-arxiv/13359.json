The proposed solution involves data cleaning techniques, which are also relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of outlier indexing to handle skewed data distributions suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the evaluation of the method using a generated dataset and a real-world application involves statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
