This method is based on alternating minimization and a variation of the expectation maximization algorithm. The paper includes experiments on synthetic data and a real-world automobile sensor dataset. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
