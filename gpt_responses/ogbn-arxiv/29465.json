Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses hardware implementation and optimization, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AR (Architecture). Additionally, the paper presents theoretical analysis and upper bounds, which could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
