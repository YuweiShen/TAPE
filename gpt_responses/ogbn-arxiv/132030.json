It also involves the concept of an eavesdropper trying to reconstruct an information sequence, which is a common scenario in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper uses mathematical analysis to show that very little secret key is required to achieve maximal distortion, which involves concepts from coding theory (cs.CC) and information theory. The paper also involves the study of the growth of the secret key space, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.DS) and security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
