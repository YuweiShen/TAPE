The paper discusses interpretability of retrieval models for document ranking, which is a common topic in information retrieval (IR) research. Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses textual features and neural models, which are common in natural language processing (NLP) research, hence cs.CL is also likely. The paper also discusses the accuracy of the interpretation, which is a common topic in machine learning (ML) research, hence cs.LG and cs.AI are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the Clueweb test collection, which is a dataset commonly used in IR research, but also has applications in cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
