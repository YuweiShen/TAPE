Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are the most likely categories. The paper also addresses challenges related to topology changes and message delivery, which are related to graph theory and algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a likely category as well. The paper proposes a new modeling language and discusses its semantic level, which is related to software engineering, making cs.SE (Software Engineering) a possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the analysis of state spaces and loop formation scenarios, which are related to formal methods and logic, making cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
