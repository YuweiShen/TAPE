The proposed transform is a modification of the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which is a widely used technique in image and video compression, and thus falls under information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed transform in comparison to existing algorithms, which could be considered as a study in signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper mentions the low-complexity nature of the proposed transform, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
