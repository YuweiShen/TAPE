The proposed method involves using a Boundary Aware Network (BAN) and a Fast-Forward Long Short-Term Memory (FF-LSTM) to generate high-quality temporal proposals and decide whether a temporal proposal is a coherent and integral story. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video truncation, which is a common problem in multimedia. The proposed method involves using a neural architecture for video truncation that consists of two components: a Boundary Aware Network (BAN) and a Fast-Forward Long Short-Term Memory (FF-LSTM). \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with video truncation, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed method involves using a neural architecture for video truncation that consists of two components: a Boundary Aware Network (BAN) and a Fast-Forward Long Short-Term Memory (FF-LSTM). \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with video truncation, which is a common problem in natural language processing. The proposed method involves using a neural architecture for video truncation that consists of two components: a Boundary Aware Network (BAN) and a Fast-Forward Long Short-Term Memory (FF-LSTM). \n5"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
