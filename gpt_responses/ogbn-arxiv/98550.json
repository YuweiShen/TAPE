The proposed approach involves integrating various types of knowledge, including expert knowledge, external resource knowledge, and grammar knowledge, which are all relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of tables as a data source and the consideration of table structure and content for semantic parsing suggest a connection to Database Systems (cs.DB). The use of pre-trained language models and entity typing models for improving semantic understanding is also relevant to Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of a decomposable model and the analysis of the model's ability to derive meaning representation suggest a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
