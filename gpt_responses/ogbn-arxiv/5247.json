This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), databases (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), software engineering (cs.SE), and computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). However, given the focus on data access and interoperability, we believe cs.DL and cs.DB are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.IR, cs.SD (scientific data management), and cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
