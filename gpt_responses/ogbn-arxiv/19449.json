The paper also introduces a more general framework for training sequence design, which can be applied to various performance metrics, indicating a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. The paper focuses on specific applications related to channel estimation and equalization, which are topics related to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
