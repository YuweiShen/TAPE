The use of convolutional networks also suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV) for tasks such as image classification. The modifications on the idea of attention and the discussion of suboptimal results suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the proposed fix for improving results involves incorporating external knowledge, which is a common approach in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
