The use of Bayesian deep learning and uncertainty estimation also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the focus on medical imaging and the specific pathologies studied suggest that it could also belong to the medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks and deep learning techniques suggests that it could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NEURON) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
