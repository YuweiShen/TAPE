The paper also discusses the use of SDP hierarchies and their limitations, which are topics typically studied in the computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also has implications for cryptography (cs.CR) and learning theory (cs.LG), as mentioned in the abstract. Finally, the paper uses information theory (cs.IT) techniques to analyze the distribution of predicates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
