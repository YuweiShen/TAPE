It may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as text detection is a crucial step in many content-based image analysis tasks. The paper also proposes a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of character and text classifiers, which could fall under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on various databases, including street view and multilingual databases, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
