These tasks are typically associated with the field of machine learning, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the system architecture and implementation, which could fall under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) or Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of performance metrics and hyperparameter modification, which are common topics in the field of Data Science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper focuses on improving efficiency in model development, which is a key concern in the field of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
