It also proposes a cloud-based system for healthcare data management, which involves handling large amounts of data in different formats, leading to the possibility of data management and storage issues, making it relevant to databases (cs.DB) and cybernetics (cs.CY). The paper also focuses on the healthcare sector, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper proposes a neural network-based biometric authentication mechanism, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
