Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the design and evaluation of interactive systems for human use. The paper also discusses specific aspects of explainability, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for concrete metrics for evaluation, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY) or computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
