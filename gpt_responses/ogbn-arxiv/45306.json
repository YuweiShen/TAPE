Additionally, the use of a hierarchical model and mutual information gain heuristic suggests the involvement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of active testing, which is a common approach in machine learning and reinforcement learning (cs.LG). Furthermore, the use of images suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) and the need for security and privacy in face detection and localization suggests the involvement of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
