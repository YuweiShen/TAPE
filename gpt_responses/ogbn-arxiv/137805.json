The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MM). The problem of camera identification is related to digital forensics (cs.CR) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of deep learning techniques is also relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
