This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of large convolution filters and the comparison with state-of-the-art image steganography schemes suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of innovative classification procedures and the detection of variations in 2D shapes suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
