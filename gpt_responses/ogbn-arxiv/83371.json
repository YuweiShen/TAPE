The paper also describes the formalization and proof of relations between different languages used in PLC programming, which involves logical reasoning. Therefore, cs.LO is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework for the formal treatment of PLC based on the IEC 61131-3 standard, which is widely used in embedded systems for industrial automation. The paper also presents a tool for automatically generating SFC representations from a graphical description and its usage for verification purposes. These aspects are related to software engineering, and hence cs.SE is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper describes different languages used in PLC programming, including Sequential Function Charts (SFC), Instruction List (IL), Ladder Diagrams (LD), and Function Block Diagrams (FBD). The paper also formalizes the semantics of these languages and describes and proves relations between them. These aspects are related to programming languages, and hence cs.PL is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on the formal treatment of PLC, which is widely used in embedded systems for industrial automation, including robotics.
