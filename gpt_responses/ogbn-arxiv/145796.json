The use of environmental information to determine the weighting function suggests a potential application in computer networks (cs.COM). The use of probabilistic models and measurements also suggests a potential application in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies suggests a potential application in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
