Specifically, it presents a new dataset for abstractive summarization of patent documents. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category, as it covers NLP and related topics. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also likely, as summarization is closely related to document retrieval and ranking. cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category, as the paper discusses training and evaluating learning models. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DL (Deep Learning) are also possible sub-categories, as they are related to machine learning and NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
