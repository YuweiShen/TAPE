The paper also mentions the Cloud-RAN scenario, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The proposed transmission scheme is robust and achieves optimal DoF, which are topics related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI, cs.MM). The paper also discusses the sharing of channel estimate and the delay in backhaul network, which are topics related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
