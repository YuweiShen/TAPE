The paper proposes a novel method to refine the embeddings of targets and aspects by utilizing a sparse coefficient vector to adjust the embeddings from the context. This method improves the performance of TABSA. The paper's focus on natural language processing and machine learning suggests that it is most likely to belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. The use of neural models and embeddings also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of attention-based models and the focus on sentiment analysis suggests that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of embeddings and the refinement method suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
