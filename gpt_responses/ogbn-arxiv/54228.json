This suggests a strong connection to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with machine learning interpretability (cs.AI) and model-agnostic explanations (cs.LG). The context of alert processing also suggests a connection to cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) and potentially to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
