This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of specific acquisition and cleaning methods, as well as the development of semi-automatic workflows utilizing neural networks, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the dataset can be used for comparisons with human experts, which could fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
