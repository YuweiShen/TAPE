This makes it relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of PITs to Interest-flooding attacks, which makes it relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper proposes a new approach to routing and multicasting, which makes it relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, which makes it relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
