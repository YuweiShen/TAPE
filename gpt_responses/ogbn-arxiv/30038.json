The paper also discusses the potential impact of these attacks on security and safety, which falls under the subfield of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of synthetic data to train a local model for crafting adversarial examples is related to the subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of defense strategies against adversarial attacks, which is a topic in the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
