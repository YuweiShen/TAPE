The approach is based on a neural network architecture that learns to predict geometrically accurate unseen views while providing fine-grained and precise control over the 6-DOF viewpoint. This involves leveraging a transforming auto-encoder in combination with a depth-guided warping procedure to generate high-quality images that reflect the desired transformation and preserve details. The paper also evaluates the approach on synthetic and real scenes and demonstrates its generalization to entirely unseen images. Given these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
