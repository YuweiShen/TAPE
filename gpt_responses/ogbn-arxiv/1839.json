The paper also uses techniques from graph theory and property testing, which are common in computer science theory (cs.DS, cs.CC). The results are related to machine learning and statistical inference, which fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
