The paper also discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for tracking and detection, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it discusses the practical relevance of precise tracking and detection. Finally, the paper mentions the use of datasets and evaluation metrics, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
