Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of cyclotomy, which is a topic in algebraic number theory and combinatorics, making cs.CC (Combinatorics) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also presents conditions for the self-duality of the constructed codes, which involves the use of cyclotomic numbers, making cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as self-dual codes have applications in network coding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
