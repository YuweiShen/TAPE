This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of subspace coding, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The results are based on mathematical analysis and optimization, which are areas of computer science theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of the results to multiple source multicast, which is a topic in communication and networking (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
