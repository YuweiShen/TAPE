This involves the use of tract orientation mapping (TOM) and accurate segmentations of the tract outline and its start and end region. The paper also introduces a custom probabilistic tracking algorithm. These techniques are all related to computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
