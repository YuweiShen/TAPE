This problem falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as it involves controlling multiple robots. The paper also uses reinforcement learning (cs.AI) to train the agents to work cooperatively towards a common goal. The use of machine learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with control policies (cs.SY) for maintaining the desired formation. Finally, the paper deals with multi-agent systems (cs.MA) as it involves multiple agents (robots) working together towards a common goal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
