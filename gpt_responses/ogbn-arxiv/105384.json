This falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the use of O(log n) unique tile types to assemble an n x n square, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper proposes a construction that prevents errors due to insufficient attachment, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
