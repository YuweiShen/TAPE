The paper also proposes a new dynamic ranking approach that allows users to adapt the ranking through interaction, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The proposed approach also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to infer user intent. Finally, the paper proposes algorithms to efficiently compute dynamic rankings and learn dynamic ranking functions, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
