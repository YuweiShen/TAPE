The use of mutual information as a similarity measure suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The proposed joint saliency map (JSM) is a novel approach that highlights corresponding salient structures in the two images, which could be related to information theory (cs.IT) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of the JSM to solve the outlier and local maxima problems suggests that the paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
