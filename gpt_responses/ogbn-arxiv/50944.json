Specifically, the paper focuses on deep and recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision and control systems. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the use of safe mutations, which could fall under the category of machine learning safety (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the processing of raw pixels, which is a common task in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the method to control systems, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
