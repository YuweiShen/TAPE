This is a problem that is commonly encountered in signal processing applications, such as spectral analysis and direction-of-arrival estimation. The paper proposes a new formulation for the $\\ell_{2,1}$ mixed-norm minimization problem, which is a popular approach for exploiting joint sparsity. The paper also discusses the relationship between different existing approaches for jointly sparse signal reconstruction. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SP (Signal Processing), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
