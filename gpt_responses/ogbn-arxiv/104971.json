The paper also proposes a learning framework that addresses the problem of insufficient labeled data, which is a common issue in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper experimentally evaluates the proposed method's performance, which involves measuring accuracy and computational costs, indicating that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
