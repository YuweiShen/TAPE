The use of a shadow-fading model and power allocation strategy also suggests the possibility of systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The analysis of the network in terms of asymptotic cases and the use of a distributed and non-iterative power allocation strategy may also indicate a potential fit for the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
