The experiments are conducted on image datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, indicating a strong connection to computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new learning paradigm for DNNs, which is a core topic in machine learning. The proposed method aims to improve the representation capability of DNNs, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method to improve the performance of DNNs, which is a core topic in artificial intelligence. The proposed method is based on external information (weights) and an entropy-based criterion, which are common techniques in AI. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a new method to improve the representation capability of DNNs, which is a core topic in neural computing. The proposed method is based on filter grafting, which is a technique to modify the structure of DNNs. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a new method to improve the representation capability of DNNs, which is a core topic in natural language processing.
