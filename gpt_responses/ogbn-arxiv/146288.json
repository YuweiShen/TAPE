Specifically, it focuses on dense networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and systems engineering (cs.SY) applications. The lightning initialization method proposed in the paper is relevant to both deep learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
