The proposed algorithm is fully distributed, which is a characteristic of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also presents a performance-oriented design of the algorithm parameters, which involves optimization and numerical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is a common theme in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
