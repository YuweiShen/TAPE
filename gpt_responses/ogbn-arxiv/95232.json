The paper also introduces several novel quantization algorithms, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper provides proofs and empirical analysis, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
