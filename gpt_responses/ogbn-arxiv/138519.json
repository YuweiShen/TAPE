Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with Computer Vision techniques, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the second likely sub-category. The paper also deals with Cybersecurity, which suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as the third likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of decision trees, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the fourth likely sub-category.
