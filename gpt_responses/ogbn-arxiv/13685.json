The focus on crowdsourced computation and peer-grading suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the study of query and round complexity is relevant to information theory (cs.IT). The specific problems studied, such as finding the maximum and top-k elements, are classic topics in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and the use of parallelization and optimization techniques suggests a connection to parallel and distributed computing (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
