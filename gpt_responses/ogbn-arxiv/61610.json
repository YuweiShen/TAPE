This topic is closely related to the field of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves the development of algorithms and models for CAVs to interact with human drivers. The paper also discusses the calibration of a lane changing model based on naturalistic data, which falls under the category of system identification and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the evaluation of energy consumption and fuel economy of CAVs can be considered as a machine learning (cs.LG) and computational engineering (cs.CE) problem, as it involves the analysis of large amounts of data and the development of simulation models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
