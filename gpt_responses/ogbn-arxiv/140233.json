Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel normalization scheme and discusses theoretical properties of the proposed method, which suggests that it could also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper compares the proposed method to batch normalization, which is widely used in Computer Vision, indicating that the paper could also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
