This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves designing precoders to optimize the transmission of information. The use of CE signals is also related to signal processing (cs.SP) and communication networks (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of low-complexity algorithms, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of improving symbol-error rate (SER) performance, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and statistical learning (cs.ST). However, since the paper does not explicitly mention these sub-categories, they are less likely than the ones mentioned above."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
