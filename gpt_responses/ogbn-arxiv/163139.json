This falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT) as it involves the study of efficient information transmission and processing. Additionally, Signal Processing (cs.SP) and Statistical Learning (cs.LG) are also likely sub-categories as the paper deals with signal denoising and the use of algorithms for estimation. Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) is another possible sub-category as the paper involves simulations to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms. Finally, Sparse Approximation (cs.SI) is also a possible sub-category as the paper deals with the use of greedy sparse approximation algorithms for DOA estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
