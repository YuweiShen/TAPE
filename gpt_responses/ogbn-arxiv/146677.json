This involves designing and implementing a new interface and applying different optimizations. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also deals with network communication and optimization, which suggests the sub-category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper involves performance evaluation and benchmarking, which could fall under cs.PF (Performance). The paper also deals with system-level design and implementation, which could fall under cs.SC (Systems and Control) and cs.SY (Systems and Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
