The paper also discusses the evolution of Android platforms and malware, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE). The development of a novel classification system based on behavioral profiles for Android apps involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the evaluation of the system's sustainability and resiliency to evasion schemes falls under the category of systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
