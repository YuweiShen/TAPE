The framework involves optimization and control barrier functions, which are related to control systems (cs.SY) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the use of nominal control inputs and minimizing distance, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
