The use of quantization and distortion levels also suggests a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of quasi-isometric embeddings and Lipschitz isometric embeddings suggests a connection to Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
