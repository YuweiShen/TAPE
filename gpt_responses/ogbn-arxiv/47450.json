The paper also mentions the use of abstract interpretation, which is a technique commonly used in formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The paper proposes a new method for termination analysis, which can be seen as a software engineering problem (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of query-mapping pairs, which is a technique used in formal verification and model checking (cs.FL). Finally, the paper deals with the termination of programs, which is a topic in the area of software correctness (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
