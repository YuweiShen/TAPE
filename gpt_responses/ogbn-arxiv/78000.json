However, since the paper specifically focuses on the training of neural networks, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of multi-layered perceptrons (MLPs), which are commonly used in computer vision and image classification tasks, hence cs.CV is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the effects of noise on model performance, which is relevant to various sub-fields of computer science, including natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
