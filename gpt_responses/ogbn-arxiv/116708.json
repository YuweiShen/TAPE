This falls under the category of system and control (cs.SY) as it deals with the estimation of signals. The paper also mentions the rejection of stochastic noises, which is a common problem in communication engineering (cs.CE) and electrical engineering (cs.ET). The use of high-gain observers is also common in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
