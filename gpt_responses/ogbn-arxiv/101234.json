The paper proposes a framework that combines embedding and rule learning, which are both techniques commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing, respectively. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.CL (natural language processing). The paper also deals with large knowledge graphs, which are typically stored in databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper evaluates the efficiency and quality of rule learning, which is a task related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
