This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), where the goal is to learn a unified model for semantics. The paper also mentions the use of regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of embeddings, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
