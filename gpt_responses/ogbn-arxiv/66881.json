Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves cross-lingual search tasks, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of bandit learning algorithms could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the use of human feedback for NMT could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper also involves analyzing the reliability of explicit user judgments, which could be categorized under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
