However, since the focus is on convergence guarantees for over-parameterized neural networks, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories. The use of adaptive gradient methods also suggests a focus on optimization, which is a key aspect of machine learning and neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
