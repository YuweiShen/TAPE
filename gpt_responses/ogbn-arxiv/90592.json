The paper focuses on the training of spiking neural networks (SNNs), which is a subfield of neural networks and falls under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the potential energy-efficiency of SNNs, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a shortcut normalization mechanism and a layer-wise error compensation approach, which are related to system engineering and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
