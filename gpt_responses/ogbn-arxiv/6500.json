The use of Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction suggests a focus on social and cultural aspects of research, which is relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The discussion of game-playing in research assessment suggests a focus on cybersecurity (cs.CR) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of computational biology (cs.CY) and health informatics (cs.HE) given the potential impact of research assessment on these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
