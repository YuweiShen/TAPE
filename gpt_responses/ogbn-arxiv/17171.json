The proposed method uses the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which is a well-known principle in information theory and machine learning, indicating that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the method is for static malware detection, which falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) and security and privacy (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
