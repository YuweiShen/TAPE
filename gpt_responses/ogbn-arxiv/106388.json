This involves using a search engine to retrieve similar sentence pairs, collecting translation pieces, and weighting them based on pseudo-probabilities. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to natural language processing, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses a search engine to retrieve similar sentence pairs, which falls under the scope of information retrieval. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): NMT is a subfield of AI, and the paper proposes a method for improving its performance. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): NMT is a machine learning task, and the paper proposes a method for incorporating retrieved examples into the decoding process. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the idea of retrieving similar examples and incorporating them into a model is a common approach in computer vision and pattern recognition tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
