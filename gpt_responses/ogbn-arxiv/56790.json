The paper also discusses the training of these networks with limited data, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper explores the effects of dataset augmentation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of committees of networks, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
