The paper also involves the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) to assign localities to information symbols. The construction of codes with unequal locality involves linear algebraic techniques (cs.DC) and the use of rank-metric codes (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the locality requirement on a code, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
