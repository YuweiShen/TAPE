This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) since the goal is to extract information from documents. The use of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) also suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.DL) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the mention of multimedia tasks and the analysis of visual cues in the paper suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
