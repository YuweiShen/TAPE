The paper also discusses the analysis of language features such as tail calls, conditionals, and first-class continuations, which are all relevant to programming languages. \n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses techniques for analyzing software behavior, which is a topic closely related to software engineering. The paper also discusses the use of static analysis to improve software quality, which is a common goal in software engineering. \n\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the use of abstract interpretation, which is a technique that is closely related to logic in computer science. The paper also discusses the use of formal methods to verify the correctness of the abstract interpretations, which is another topic that is closely related to logic in computer science. \n\n4. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the transformation of abstract machines, which are closely related to automata. The paper also discusses the use of formal methods to verify the correctness of the abstract interpretations, which is another topic that is closely related to formal languages and automata theory. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not directly discuss cryptography or security, the techniques for analyzing software behavior are relevant to these fields.
