The paper also presents a new analytical framework for characterizing the delivery rate and delivery delay performance, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses simulations to validate the analytical results, which is a common practice in the multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
