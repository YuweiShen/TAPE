This topic falls under several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Computational Geometry (cs.CG), Graph Theory (cs.GT), and Digital Libraries (cs.DL). The paper's focus on modular decomposition and pruning rules suggests a strong connection to cs.DM and cs.DS, while its application to graph classes and maximum matching algorithms suggests a connection to cs.CG and cs.GT. The mention of distance-hereditary graphs and modular-treewidth also suggests a connection to cs.DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
