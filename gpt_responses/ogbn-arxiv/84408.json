Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of speech features such as Spectrograms and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) which are commonly used in speech processing. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of metric learning strategies such as center loss, which is commonly used in Computer Vision (cs.CV) for face recognition tasks. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves the use of techniques from both speech processing and computer vision. \n\nFurthermore, the paper involves the use of regularization techniques such as reconstruction, which is commonly used in Machine Learning (cs.LG) to prevent overfitting. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for various tasks. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
