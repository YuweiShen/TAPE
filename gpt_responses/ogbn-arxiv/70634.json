This topic falls under the category of data structures and algorithms, which is covered by cs.DS. The paper also mentions the need for security guarantees, which suggests that it may belong to the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the theoretical guarantees of the hash functions, which could fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The implementation details and optimizations mentioned in the paper could also fall under the categories of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
