The paper also focuses on incorporating photometric information (i.e., texture) of the scene to compute the uncertainty of vision-based localization during path planning, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also describes how to compute trajectories online, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with scenarios with no prior knowledge about the map, which involves systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
