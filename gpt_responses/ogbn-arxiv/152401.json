The paper presents algorithms with sublinear search time and linear preprocessing time and space, which suggests that it belongs to the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the use of cumulative weight threshold, which is a concept in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper uses average-case analysis, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
