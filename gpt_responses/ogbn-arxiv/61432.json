The paper also specifically mentions Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) as a central problem in this class, which is a subfield of computer vision and computational biology. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper involves numerical optimization and analysis of algorithms, which are relevant to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
