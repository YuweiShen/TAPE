The paper also introduces embedding-based methods for cross-lingual projection, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of media manipulation strategies involves identifying patterns and trends, which could fall under the category of social and information sciences (cs.SI). The use of embeddings and machine learning also falls under the category of deep learning (cs.DL).
