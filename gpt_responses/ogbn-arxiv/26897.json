The paper also presents a novel statistical recognition method, which involves maximizing the likelihood of distances between features, indicating a potential fit for machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of datasets such as LFW and YTF suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the asymptotically normal distribution of the Kullback-Leibler discrimination, indicating a potential fit for cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
