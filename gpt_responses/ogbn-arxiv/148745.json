This problem is closely related to machine learning and statistics, and hence, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of machine learning, which includes the problem of learning causal models from data. The paper's focus on developing a new algorithm for learning linear SEMs from observational data makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of artificial intelligence, which includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. The paper's focus on developing an efficient algorithm for learning causal models from data makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of data structures and algorithms, which includes the problem of designing efficient algorithms for various computational problems. The paper's focus on developing an algorithm that works in the high-dimensional regime and has polynomial time complexity makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of information theory, which includes the problem of learning causal models from data.
