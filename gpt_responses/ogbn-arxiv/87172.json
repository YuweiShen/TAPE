The paper also discusses weight distributions and linear recursions, which are common topics in combinatorics and discrete mathematics. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the weight distribution of Boolean functions, which is a topic in information theory. The paper also discusses linear recursions, which are used in coding theory and information theory. \n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the problem of deciding which quadratic RS functions are balanced, which is a computational problem. The paper also discusses the complexity of computing the weight distribution of quadratic RS functions. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses Boolean functions, which are commonly used in cryptography. The paper also discusses the problem of deciding which quadratic RS functions are balanced, which is relevant to cryptography. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not directly relate to social and information networks, but the topic of Boolean functions is relevant to network security and privacy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
