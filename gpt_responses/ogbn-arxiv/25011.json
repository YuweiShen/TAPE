This involves improving the performance of independent reinforcement learners, specifically the popular Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) approaches by exploiting anonymity. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper also deals with controlling non-stationarity introduced by other agents using entropy of agent density distribution, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
