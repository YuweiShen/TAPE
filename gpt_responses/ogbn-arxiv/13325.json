It also presents a family of gradient regularization methods that effectively penalize the gradient of loss function w.r.t. inputs. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the proposed framework is applied to Maxout networks and experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. \n\nFurthermore, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as adversarial examples have drawn much attention from the machine learning and data mining community, and the proposed framework aims to build robust models against them. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as adversarial examples could change the prediction of many learning models, including state-of-the-art deep learning models, and the proposed framework aims to address this issue. \n\nFinally, it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the proposed framework is applied to neural networks and aims to improve their robustness against adversarial examples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
