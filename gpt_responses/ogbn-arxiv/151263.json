The use of meta-learning techniques to learn active-learning strategies is a recent and active area of research in machine learning, which makes cs.LG the most likely category. The paper also deals with image classification, which falls under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper involves the selection of examples to label, which is a problem of optimization and decision-making, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves the use of a pool-based setting, which is a common setting in data science and machine learning, which makes cs.DS a likely category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
