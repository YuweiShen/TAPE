This involves designing a model that can learn the propagation patterns in the graph, which is a typical machine learning task. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method uses a neural network to predict traffic flow, which is a typical application of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called Graph Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN), which is designed to learn the propagation patterns in the graph. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a new topological framework, called Linkage Network, to model the road networks and present the propagation patterns of traffic flow. This involves analyzing the social and information networks of traffic flow. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an efficient traffic prediction method that reduces the computational complexity significantly while keeping the high accuracy.
