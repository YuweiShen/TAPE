The use of word-vector averaging and natural language entailment data suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The task of matching a proposition against a corpus also involves information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the user study on disaster recovery suggests a potential application in cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
