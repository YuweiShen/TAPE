The paper proposes utilizing file paths as an auxiliary input to the classifier, which is a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The use of neural networks is also mentioned, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses conducting an interpretability analysis, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper mentions using a dataset of approximately 10 million samples, which is a large-scale machine learning task and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
