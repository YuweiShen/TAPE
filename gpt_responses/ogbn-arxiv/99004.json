This involves developing a model that can learn from data and make predictions, which is a key aspect of machine learning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an operationalization of individual fairness that does not rely on a human specification of a distance metric. Instead, it proposes novel approaches to elicit and leverage side-information on equally deserving individuals to counter subordination between social groups. This involves the use of AI techniques to learn from data and make predictions. \n3. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the challenge of operationalizing individual fairness and proposes a solution that can counter subordination between social groups. This involves addressing issues related to privacy and security, which are key concerns in the field of cryptography and security. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the challenge of operationalizing individual fairness and proposes a solution that can counter subordination between social groups.
