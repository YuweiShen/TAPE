The most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), as the paper focuses on deriving bounds on the beamforming capacity and characterizing the optimal training and feedback overhead. The next likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), as the paper deals with multiantenna links and channel state information feedback, which are important topics in wireless networking. The paper also touches on system-level optimization (cs.SY), as it considers the impact of coherence time and number of transmit antennas on the optimal training and feedback overhead. Finally, the paper involves some aspects of machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG), as it uses a codebook of random vectors for beamforming and derives bounds on the capacity using statistical techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
