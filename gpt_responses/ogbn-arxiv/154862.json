The paper discusses the use of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. The paper also mentions the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, which is a common tool in computer vision (CV) research. Overall, the paper's focus on text analysis and machine learning techniques suggests that it is most likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper's use of OCR and potential integration with existing software for the Chronicling America project suggests that it may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Deep Learning (cs.DL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
