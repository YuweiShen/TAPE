The paper also uses information-theoretic tools such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence to analyze the problem. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Change detection is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a Bayesian framework for solving the problem. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as sparse sampling. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of detecting a change in a system, which is a classic problem in systems and control. The paper also proposes a framework for analyzing the performance of a communication system under a sampling constraint. \n4. cs.SP (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with the problem of detecting a change in a time series, which is a classic problem in signal processing. The paper also discusses the use of signal processing techniques such as filtering and sampling. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of detecting a change in a time series, which is a common problem in multimedia applications such as video surveillance and audio processing. The paper also discusses the use of multimedia techniques such as compression and sampling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
