Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a neural-based approach, which suggests that it could also fit into cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Learning). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with low-resource languages, which could also make it relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
