This suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of logic in computer science.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with message-passing concurrency, which is a common technique used in distributed and parallel computing. This suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of distributed computing.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of a new programming language feature, which falls under the scope of software engineering research.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions the use of a blocking intermediate language and a non-blocking language, which suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
