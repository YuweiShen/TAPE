The paper also discusses the design of parameterized algorithms, which suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The problem of finding a connected induced subgraph with a CMSO-definable property relates to graph theory (cs.DM) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
