The paper focuses on the challenges of managing access to shared spectrum and proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic pricing mechanism to efficiently mediate access to shared spectrum. The paper also presents the Iris system architecture that embeds this dynamic pricing mechanism alongside cloud-RAN and RAN slicing design principles in a practical neutral-host design tailored for the indoor small-cell environment. Given the focus on networking and communication technologies, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of AI techniques such as deep reinforcement learning, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses information theory and the use of spectrum, which suggests that cs.IT (Information Theory) is another possible sub-category. The paper also discusses system design and optimization, which suggests that cs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses security and privacy concerns related to shared spectrum access, which suggests that cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
