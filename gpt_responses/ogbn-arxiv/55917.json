Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also mentions the use of extension fields, which are commonly studied in the subfield of Information Theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses computational costs, which is a topic studied in the subfield of Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the use of finite fields, which is a topic studied in the subfield of Cybersecurity (cs.CY).
