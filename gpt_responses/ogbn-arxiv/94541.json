The technique involves fuzz testing, which is a common approach for finding vulnerabilities in software systems and falls under the computer security (cs.CR) category. The paper also proposes a learning algorithm to solve the problem of assigning fuzzing iterations to test cases, which involves machine learning and falls under the programming languages (cs.PL), systems and control (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
