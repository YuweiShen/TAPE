The use of backpropagation suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG), while the application to natural language inference suggests a focus on natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of attention-based neural networks suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and the empirical results suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
