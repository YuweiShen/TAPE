The use of simplified shape graphs and graph matching techniques suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The fact that the method is applicable across multiple shape representations suggests that it may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The use of feature points and point-to-point maps suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the emphasis on robustness and efficiency suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
