Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves networking and distributed systems, which suggests the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed mechanism through experiments, which indicates the category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
