The use of psycholinguistic category scores from word usage suggests a focus on natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). The study also investigates how people with different scores exhibited different reply and retweet behaviors on Twitter, which could fall under social and information networks (cs.SI) and social computing (cs.SOC). The predictive models built from psycholinguistic category based features suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and data mining (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
