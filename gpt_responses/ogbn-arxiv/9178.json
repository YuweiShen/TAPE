This falls under the purview of information theory, making cs.IT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a new waveform for cellular networks, which is a key component of networking and internet architecture. This makes cs.NI a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the design of a new waveform for 5G cellular networks, which is a key aspect of communication and networking. This makes cs.COMM a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of a new waveform for 5G cellular networks, which involves optimizing the use of available bandwidth and improving spectrum efficiency. This falls under the purview of systems and control, making cs.SY a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the design of a new waveform for 5G cellular networks, which is a key component of multimedia communication.
