The paper presents an improved integrality gap instance for the Calinescu-Karloff-Rabani LP relaxation of the problem, which is a well-studied relaxation technique. The paper uses techniques from graph theory, linear programming, and approximation algorithms, which are all common topics in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
