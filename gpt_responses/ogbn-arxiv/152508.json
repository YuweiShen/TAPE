Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the need for domain adaptation and customization, which suggests a potential overlap with cs.DL (deep learning) and cs.CL (computational linguistics). The mention of interactive search tools and cognitive assistance suggests a potential overlap with cs.CY (human-computer interaction). Finally, the paper briefly touches on related tasks such as patent valuation and litigation, which suggests a potential overlap with cs.CR (computing research)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
