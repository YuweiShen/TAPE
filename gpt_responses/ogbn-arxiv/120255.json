This is a core machine learning problem and hence, cs.LG is the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an AI agent that solves long-horizon tasks from images purely by latent imagination. This is a core AI problem and hence, cs.AI is the second most likely category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with learning world models from high-dimensional sensory inputs (images) and solving visual control tasks. This is a core computer vision problem and hence, cs.CV is the third most likely category.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with learning behaviors for visual control tasks, which is a core problem in robotics. Hence, cs.RO is the fourth most likely category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with learning behaviors for long-horizon tasks, which is a core problem in systems and control. Hence, cs.SY is the fifth most likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
