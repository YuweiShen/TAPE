This is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of massive phased arrays, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the optimization of network utility, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of beamforming in crowded areas such as shopping malls and office buildings, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of iterative algorithms to obtain locally optimal beamforming vectors, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of Augmented Reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
