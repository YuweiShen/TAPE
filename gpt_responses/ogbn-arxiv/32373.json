The paper also proposes a machine learning approach to detect fraudulent behavior, which involves analyzing patterns of interactions between fake accounts and target customers. This approach involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social network analysis (cs.SI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of graph algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
