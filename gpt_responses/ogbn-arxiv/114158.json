The use of deep CNN detection framework also suggests that it falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also introduces a novel approach to eliminate background and capture minute variances among different subordinate categories, which indicates that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of the CUB-200-2011 Bird dataset suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with object recognition, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR), making it a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
