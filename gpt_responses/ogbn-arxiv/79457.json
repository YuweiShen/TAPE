Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum, which is a topic of interest in the field of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves the use of stochastic geometry to analyze the coverage probability of UAVs, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-offs involved in designing solutions for mmWave scenarios, which is a topic of interest in the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
