The problem is formulated as a semantic segmentation task, which is a common task in computer vision. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on occupancy grid mapping, which is an important component of autonomous vehicle perception. The proposed approach is aimed at enabling safe autonomous driving, which is a key application of robotics. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a data-driven approach for learning an inverse sensor model. The approach is based on deep learning and is learned in a self-supervised manner. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a data-driven approach for learning an inverse sensor model. The approach is based on deep learning and is learned in a self-supervised manner, which are common themes in artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper focuses on occupancy grid mapping, which is an important component of autonomous vehicle perception.
