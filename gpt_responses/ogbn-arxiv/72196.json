It could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as pose estimation is important for robot manipulation. The use of classification and regression networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of applications in augmented reality suggests that it could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
