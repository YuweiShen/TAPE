The use of Delaunay triangulation and Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms also suggests a potential fit for sub-categories related to computational geometry and graph algorithms (cs.SI, cs.GR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the algorithm for visualizing tag clouds, which could potentially fall under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
