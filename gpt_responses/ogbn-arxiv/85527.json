The focus is on reducing the space complexity while maintaining the same or similar time complexity as the classical algorithms. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), algorithms (cs.AL), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
