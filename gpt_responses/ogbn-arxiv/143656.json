This topic falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of text classification, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing recovery methods and proposes a new method, which involves algorithmic design (cs.PL) and scalability (cs.SD). Finally, the paper compares the proposed method to other recovery methods, which involves evaluation and comparison (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
