The application of the method is in the field of digital rock physics and materials analysis, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the generated images using Minkowski functionals, which is a tool commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
