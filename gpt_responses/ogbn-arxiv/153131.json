Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The method involves injecting a virtual negative class into the original softmax, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve image and video data, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the method involves optimizing the decision boundary constraint, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
