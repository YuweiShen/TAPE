The use of kernel methods and low-dimensional subspace modeling suggests that the paper is likely to be in the area of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method to motion capture data suggests that it may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of online methods and streaming data suggests that it may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
