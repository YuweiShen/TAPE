The proposed framework involves real-time segmentation of workpiece regions from non-workpiece regions in a point cloud data, which is a key task in robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The proposed framework involves the use of a fully convolutional neural network for real-time workpiece segmentation. This is a common technique in computer vision for image segmentation tasks. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed framework involves the use of a neural network for workpiece segmentation, which is a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed framework involves the use of a neural network for workpiece segmentation, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with point cloud data obtained from 3D sensors, which is a common data format in computer graphics.
