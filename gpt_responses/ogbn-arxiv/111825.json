The use of optimal transport theory to generalize the scheme for a message point in a higher dimensional space suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of information theory and probability (cs.ITP) and machine learning (cs.LG). The applications of the message point framework in human-computer interfaces and multi-antenna communications suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
