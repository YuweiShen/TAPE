The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in terms of the storage overhead and erasure rate, as well as control systems (cs.SY) in terms of maintaining recoverability of the source data. Additionally, the paper involves networked systems (cs.NI) in terms of the repairer continually reading data over a network, and probability and statistics (cs.PF) in terms of the random failure of storage nodes and the average lifetime of a node before failure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
