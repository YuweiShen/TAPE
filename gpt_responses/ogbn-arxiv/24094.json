Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of GPUs for parallel training, which falls under the category of computer vision (CV) and systems and control (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper introduces an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
