Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of bidirectional LSTM and a Transition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU) for output decoding, which are common techniques in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a neural network JIT compiler for fast inference during parsing, which is a topic in the field of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of frame graphs, which are a common tool in computer vision (cs.CV) for representing objects and their relationships."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
