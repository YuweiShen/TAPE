This involves the study of signal recovery in the presence of quantization noise, which is a key topic in information theory. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission and reception of multimedia signals (OFDM) using MIMO systems, which falls under the scope of multimedia research. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of DMAs for MIMO-OFDM receivers, which are commonly used in wireless communication networks. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes methods for adjusting the DMA parameters based on channel state information, which involves the design of control systems. \n5. cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The paper deals with the design and analysis of dynamic metasurface antennas, which are electromagnetic structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
