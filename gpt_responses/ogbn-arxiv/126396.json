It uses deep learning techniques to model the geometric consistency within adjacent frames and the temporal continuity of the camera pose. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories. Additionally, it proposes a new loss function and a dynamic hard-edge mask to handle the non-consistency in fast camera motion, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques. Hence, it could also be classified under Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
