The paper also discusses the issue of fixation prediction (FP) in panoramic contents, which is another subfield of computer vision. The paper involves the collection of a new dataset, which requires human annotation, and the benchmarking of state-of-the-art SOD models, which involves machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods for SOD in panoramic images, which involves a discussion of the challenges of working with 360{\\deg} images (cs.GR). Finally, the paper involves the use of human eye fixation maps, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and the use of multiple cubic projection-based fine-tuning method, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
