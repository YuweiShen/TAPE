The paper proposes a new sharing scheme of composition function across multiple tasks, which involves learning a shared meta-network to capture the meta-knowledge of semantic composition and generate the parameters of the task-specific semantic composition models. This approach is related to multi-task learning (MTL), which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for improving generalization and efficiency by jointly learning multiple related tasks. The paper also involves training neural networks, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) as well as NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CV, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
