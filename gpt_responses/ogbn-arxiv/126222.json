The use of LP relaxations is a common technique in optimization and algorithms, suggesting that the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
