This makes it relevant to the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Social and Economic Systems (cs.SOC), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also proposes algorithms for identifying dense structures in temporal networks, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper uses real-world data from schools, which could also make it relevant to the sub-category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
