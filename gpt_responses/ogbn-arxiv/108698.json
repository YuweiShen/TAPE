The approach leverages fiducials, which are visual markers, and uses visual and inertial data to estimate the location of moving bodies. This involves computer vision techniques such as object detection and tracking, which are part of the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The system also involves control and verification, which are part of the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classification and regression, which are part of the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes an open source implementation and provides datasets for others to use, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
