The use of optimization frameworks and efficient estimation approaches also suggests a machine learning focus.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the problem of imperfect data matrix and output vector information, which is a common problem in information theory. The use of minimax optimization and regret also suggests an information theory focus.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the use of optimization and estimation methods can be applied to network analysis problems, such as community detection or link prediction.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of semi-definite programming (SDP) to solve the robust least squares problem, which is a common optimization problem in data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the use of optimization methods to solve the robust least squares problem, which is a common problem in numerical analysis.
