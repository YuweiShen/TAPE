This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of MRI biomarkers suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV), while the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
