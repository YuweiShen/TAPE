The paper also discusses the use of discriminative models based on billions of faces, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also deals with challenges arising from illumination and low light, which are common issues in multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses a challenging set of identification queries, which suggests a focus on security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
