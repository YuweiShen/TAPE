The paper also involves object detection using neural networks, which falls under computer vision. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short term memory (LSTM) networks for feature extraction and recognition respectively, are common techniques in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) research.
