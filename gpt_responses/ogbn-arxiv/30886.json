The model yields a market equilibrium depicting traditional and distributed generator and load setpoints. This suggests that the paper falls under the Systems and Control category.\n\n2. cs.CY (Computational Geometry): The paper does not explicitly deal with computational geometry, but it does discuss the integration of a lightweight Blockchain implementation and smart contracts. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the Computational Geometry category.\n\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the need for a secure energy trading platform as the number of crowdsourcees and energy trading transactions scales up. To that end, the presented framework is integrated with a lightweight Blockchain implementation and smart contracts. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the Cryptography and Security category.\n\n4. cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper discusses the design of crowdsourcing incentives to steer crowdsourcees to the market equilibrium. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the Game Theory category.\n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the crowdsourcing of small-scale energy generation or energy trading from distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, and shapable loads. This suggests that the paper may also fall under"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
