The paper specifically focuses on the technical aspects of implementing such a system, including network protocols and data traffic prioritization, which suggests that it belongs to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. However, the paper also touches on security concerns (cs.CR), system dynamics and control (cs.SY), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and information theory (cs.IT) in the context of IoT-enabled communication during disasters. Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
