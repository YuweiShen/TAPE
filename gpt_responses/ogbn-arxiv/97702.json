The focus is on computational complexity, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper specifically mentions multiagent settings (cs.MA), which further supports these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
