This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and large scale fading decoding (LSFD) receivers, which are techniques used in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents capacity lower bounds and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) approximations, which are relevant to communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
