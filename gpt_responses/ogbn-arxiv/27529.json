The most likely category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which specifically deals with the study of social networks and their properties. The second likely category is cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences), which covers research on social phenomena and their computational modeling. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and digital libraries (cs.DL) as it deals with the analysis of knowledge mobilization networks. Finally, the paper touches on cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) as it discusses the importance of detecting nodes with high temporal centrality to accelerate mobilization flow in the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
