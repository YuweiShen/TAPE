This involves reasoning about uncertainty and planning over discrete modes and continuous states, which are common topics in artificial intelligence.\n2. cs.RO - The paper focuses on applications such as routing in autonomous vehicle networks, which falls under the category of robotics. The proposed algorithm is designed to handle dynamic updates and hierarchical planning and execution, which are important in robotics.\n3. cs.LG - The paper uses approximate dynamic programming for stochastic planning over continuous states, which is a common technique in machine learning. The algorithm also uses domain-agnostic abstractions to efficiently unify heuristic search, which is another topic in machine learning.\n4. cs.SY - The paper deals with decision-making in dynamic systems, which is a core topic in systems and control theory. The proposed algorithm involves planning and execution in a hierarchical manner, which is relevant to systems and control.\n5. cs.PL - The paper introduces a new class of Markov Decision Processes and develops a new algorithm to solve them, which falls under the category of programming languages and compilers.
