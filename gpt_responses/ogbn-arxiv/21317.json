The paper also discusses the effect of sensing errors, which is a topic in the field of cyber security (cs.CR). The use of maximum-likelihood estimators and closed-form expressions suggests a focus on mathematical modeling and analysis, which is a common theme in the field of control systems (cs.SY).
