The paper proposes a novel approach for detecting novel classes in a hierarchical taxonomy, which involves the use of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of semantic embeddings, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in zero-shot learning, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
