The paper also discusses the use of trusted proof checkers, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper mentions the implementation of a reference checker, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the formal checking of proof certificates, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves the use of algorithms to verify the correctness of proofs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
