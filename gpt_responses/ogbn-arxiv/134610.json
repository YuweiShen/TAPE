The use of visual semantic embeddings and adaptation of existing datasets also suggest a natural language processing (cs.CL) component. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of lifelong learning (LLL) and the need for efficient and effective LLL methods, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
