The method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting pairwise relative poses between query and database images. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves training the neural network in an end-to-end manner, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a challenging indoor localization dataset, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
