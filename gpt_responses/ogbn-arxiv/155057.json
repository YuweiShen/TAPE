This involves run-time processing and learning both locally and globally. The paper proposes a systematic ensemble learning method called Hedged Bandits, which comes with both long run (asymptotic) and short run (rate of learning) performance guarantees. The paper also illustrates the performance of Hedged Bandits in the context of medical informatics, but notes that the proposed methods have numerous other applications, including network monitoring and security, online recommendation systems, social networks, smart cities, etc. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as the paper discusses learning techniques for processing and analyzing data. The next likely categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CY (Computers and Society), as the paper mentions applications in social networks and smart cities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
