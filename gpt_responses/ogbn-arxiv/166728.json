Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the problem of bandwidth under-utilization and proposes a novel loss-based CCA, which involves implementing the mechanism of agility factor. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper involves simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed CCA, which could place it in cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
