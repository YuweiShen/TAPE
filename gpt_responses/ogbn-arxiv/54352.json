The proposed method also involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly studied in the cs.LG sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of associative embedding method, which is a technique used in robotics and control systems, and thus could be classified under the cs.RO sub-category. The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms to estimate human poses, which could be classified under the cs.AI sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on synthetic images, which could be classified under the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
