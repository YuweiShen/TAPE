The paper extensively discusses various computer vision techniques used for fin detection, feature extraction, and recognition. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of fingerprinting techniques for encoding fin individuality and measuring the species-specific distribution of visual individuality along the fin contour. These techniques are commonly used in information retrieval for indexing and searching large databases. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis of multimedia data (dorsal fin images) for the purpose of animal biometrics. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the use of non-linear models for individual animal recognition, which are commonly used in cryptography and security for authentication and identification purposes. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a fine-grained multi-instance framework for individual animal recognition, which involves the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
