This involves using a fuzzy rule controller to represent human knowledge and a refine module to fine-tune suboptimal prior knowledge. The paper focuses on experiments conducted on both discrete and continuous control tasks, which are common in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and control systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
