This involves using convolutional neural networks to combine user and question feature representations to compute scores for each user, with the highest-scoring user being identified as the expert. This work is likely to fall under the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
