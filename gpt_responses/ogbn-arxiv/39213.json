The use of reinforcement learning and dynamic programming also suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques for interpreting the data, which suggests that it may also belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category.
