The paper introduces the notion of p-group encodable and p-group decodable linear STBCs and provides an explicit construction of fully-diverse signal sets for differential scaled unitary STBCs. This work involves concepts from information theory, signal processing, and communication systems, which are covered in the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.IT, cs.SY, and cs.COMM. Additionally, the paper discusses the encoding and decoding complexity of the STBCs, which may involve concepts from multimedia processing (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
