Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely category. The paper also proposes a two-step approach that involves computing and predicting, which are topics related to programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with monitoring over finite traces, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE).
