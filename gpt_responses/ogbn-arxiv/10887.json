Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the evaluation of MT output, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also touches on the expected shelf-life of translations, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as well as cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) since it involves the interaction between humans and technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
