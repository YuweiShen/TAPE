The specific focus on the unlabeled case suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of computational complexity theory to prove hardness results suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Finally, the application of the results to real-world systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
