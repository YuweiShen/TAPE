The problem also has applications in computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) due to its relevance in tasks such as image recognition and recommendation systems. The paper also presents a sampling technique that achieves a bi-criterion approximation, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
