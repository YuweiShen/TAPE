The use of data augmentation and loss functions are also common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The application of these techniques is specifically targeted towards medical imaging (cs.MED), which is a subfield of computer vision. The use of GPUs for acceleration is also a common topic in neural networks (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
