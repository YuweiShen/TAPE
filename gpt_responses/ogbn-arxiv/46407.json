The paper proposes a solution for real-time navigation of UAVs to track a dynamic target using heterogeneously sensed information. This falls under the scope of robotics and hence cs.RO is the most likely category.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a dynamic radar network of UAVs for real-time and high-accuracy tracking of malicious targets. This involves control and coordination of multiple UAVs, which falls under the scope of systems and control.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the problem of tracking unauthorized small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) hiding behind buildings or concealing in large UAV networks. This falls under the scope of security and hence cs.CR is a likely category.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a solution where the UAVs share information with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. This involves networking and communication between multiple UAVs and hence cs.NI is a likely category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a solution where the UAVs plan their own trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state under UAV kinematic and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
