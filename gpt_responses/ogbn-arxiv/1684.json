The study also involves user experience and usability testing, which suggests a potential fit for human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The CoSTAR system integrates perception and reasoning, which aligns with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the study involves varying perception capabilities, which suggests a potential fit for computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
