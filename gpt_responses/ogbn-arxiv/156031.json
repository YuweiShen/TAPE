The focus is on robustness envelopes, which are used to address contingencies in plans, and this is a topic that is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also presents an algorithm for approximating robustness envelopes, which involves computational optimization (cs.PL) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
