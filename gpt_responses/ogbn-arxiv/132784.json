The paper also discusses linear detection and optimum decoding, which are techniques used in signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper considers the large system limit, which is a topic related to machine learning and optimization (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper discusses the behavior of spectral efficiency as load increases, which is a topic related to statistical learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
