The use of deep neural networks and variational inference also suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
