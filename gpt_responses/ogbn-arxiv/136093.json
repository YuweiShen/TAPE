The use of lidar measurements and neural networks suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new neural network architecture, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with motion estimation in dynamic occupancy grid maps, which is relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
