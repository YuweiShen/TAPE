The concept of Pareto Efficiency is also relevant to optimization and decision making (cs.DS). The use of cardinal utility functions and the assumption of closed swaps suggest a mathematical and algorithmic approach, which is common in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the problem of fair allocation is also relevant to social choice theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
