The paper also discusses the use of a hierarchical whole body control approach for locomotion on complex terrains. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) design for momentum control and computing the optimal momentum feedback law in a receding horizon fashion. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a trajectory optimization framework and a feedback control approach, which are common techniques in machine learning. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the use of trajectory optimization and feedback control can be applied to tasks such as visual servoing and object tracking. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for planning and controlling the motion of a humanoid robot, which can be considered an application of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
