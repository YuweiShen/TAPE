Additionally, the paper proposes a method that combines and draws on the strengths of two different neural network architectures, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of graph neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
