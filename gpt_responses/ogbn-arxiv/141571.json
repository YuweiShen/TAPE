The paper also discusses several examples of applications of the generalized determinization construction, including partial Mealy machines, Moore automata, Rabin probabilistic automata, and pushdown automata, which are all related to programming languages (cs.PL), formal languages (cs.FL), and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the characterization of several equivalences that are of interest in the concurrency community, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
