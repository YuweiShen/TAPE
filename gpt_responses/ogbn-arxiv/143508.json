The paper proposes a method to obfuscate the predictable behavior of real-time systems, which involves modifying the scheduling algorithm used by the system. This modification is done at the operating system level, which falls under the category of operating systems (cs.OS). The paper also evaluates the proposed method using both a realistic embedded platform and synthetic workloads, which falls under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes a metric to measure the amount of obfuscation achieved, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
