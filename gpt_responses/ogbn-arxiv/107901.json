Additionally, the paper also discusses the performance of BitSplit-Net on GPU, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) and binary neural networks (BNNs) also suggests that the paper could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on improving the hardware performance of DNNs suggests that it could also belong to the computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
