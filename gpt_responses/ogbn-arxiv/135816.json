This falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves constructions and bounds on the achievable rates, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses families of tampering functions, which could be related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
