This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed approach also involves a Gated Graph Neural Network, which is a popular technique in robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for task annotation, which falls under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
