The use of trees and cycles in the paper suggests that it may also fall under data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of simultaneous embedding is related to graph theory (cs.GT) and the paper proposes algorithms for solving it, which falls under algorithms and data structures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
