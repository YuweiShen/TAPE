It also involves software engineering concepts such as programming languages and automated generation of code (cs.SE). The focus on improving user experience and interaction in domains such as banking, travel, education, and healthcare suggests a human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective (cs.HC). Finally, the use of concepts such as currying and partial evaluation suggests a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
