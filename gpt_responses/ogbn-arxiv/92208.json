Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep neural networks, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it aims to help users quickly evaluate if a video is worth watching. The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it mentions generating \"trailer-like\" highlights."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
