The regularizer is designed to encourage sparsity and clustering of features, which are important techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and statistics (cs.ST). The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed regularizer, which is relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
