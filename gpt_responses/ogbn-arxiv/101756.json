The perception package detects AR markers and/or IR beacons to track a person using AI algorithms such as particle filters and nonlinear optimization to extract the SE(3) information of the 2D feature. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
