This involves using dominating-set theory and deep learning approaches to represent graph nodes as low-dimensional vectors. The paper also discusses the potential applications of expert embeddings, such as accurately modeling experts' expertise or computing experts' scores in expert recommendation systems. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SD (Software Engineering), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
