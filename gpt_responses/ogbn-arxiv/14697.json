The method involves a sparse representation of the whole brain connectivity matrix and an iterative clustering approach. This work involves machine learning, data analysis, and computational neuroscience, which are all relevant to the arXiv CS sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
