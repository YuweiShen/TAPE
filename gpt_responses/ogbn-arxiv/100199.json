The proposed method involves the use of Markov networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM) and the coupled representation similarity metric (CRSM) is a similarity measure, which is a common topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also deals with the problem of representing heterogeneous images in a homogeneous manner, which is a common problem in computer graphics (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
