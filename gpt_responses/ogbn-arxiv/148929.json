Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses label bias, which is a common issue in machine learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning) likely categories as well. The paper uses neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision) a possible category.
