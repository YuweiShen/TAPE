This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper uses tools from this field to derive the optimal solutions. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper is concerned with designing a cognitive radio system that can coexist with a primary user while maximizing its own performance. This involves issues related to network protocols, resource allocation, and interference management, which are all relevant to the networking and internet architecture community. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper considers the stability of both the primary and secondary queues, which is a key issue in control theory. The authors use Lyapunov analysis to derive stability conditions and ensure that the queues do not overflow. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper assumes that the secondary user has to sense the spectrum randomly to avoid interfering with the primary user. This involves issues related to security and privacy, as the secondary user needs to ensure that it does not access the primary user's data. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper assumes that the secondary user has multipacket reception (MPR) capabilities, which means that it can receive multiple packets simultaneously.
