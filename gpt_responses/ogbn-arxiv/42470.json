The paper discusses the optimization of search parameters in chess, which can be considered as a form of strategic decision-making in a game, and hence can be related to cs.GT.\n5. cs.PL - Programming languages is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages. The paper discusses the implementation of a chess program and the optimization of its search parameters, which can be related to cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
