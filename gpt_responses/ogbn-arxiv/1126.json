The proposed method involves computing losses directly between source and target images, which is a technique that can be applied to a wide range of image translation problems and is therefore relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) community. The paper also discusses the use of perceptual networks, which are commonly used in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
