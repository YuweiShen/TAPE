The paper also discusses regularization techniques to reduce complexity, which is a common topic in the field of machine learning optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses Size, Weight and Power - Cost (SWaP-C) considerations, which are relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY) and hardware design (cs.AR). Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
