The paper also discusses hyper-parameter optimization, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the proposed method involves modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs), which is a technique commonly used in AI for modeling diversity. \n\nThe paper's experiments involve robotics and computer vision tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on optimization and regret bounds suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
