Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new ensemble of nested lattices based on lifting subcodes of a linear code, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the sensitivity of the achievable rates to the noise distribution, which is related to statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
