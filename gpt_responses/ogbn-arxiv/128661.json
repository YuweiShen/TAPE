The paper also introduces a new approach for training CNNs using ensembles of joint spaces of kernels, which involves optimization on product submanifolds of convolution kernels. This introduces a geometric aspect to the optimization problem, which could potentially fall under the categories of numerical analysis (cs.NA) and differential geometry (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's approach involves using multiple constraints to construct ensembles of PEMs, which could be seen as a form of multi-objective optimization, falling under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
