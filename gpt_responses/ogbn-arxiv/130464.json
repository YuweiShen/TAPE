Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel approach to transfer knowledge from image domain to video domain, which involves training deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves crawling web images to train deep learning based classifiers, which could fall under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the domain shift problem and proposes a solution using Siamese EnergyNet structure, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves designing a novel approach to learn energy functions on attention maps, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
