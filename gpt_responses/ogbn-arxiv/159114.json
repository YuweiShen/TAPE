The paper also introduces new compression techniques for inverted indexes, which are data structures commonly used in information retrieval and data structures (cs.DS). The use of run-length, Lempel-Ziv, and grammar compression also suggests a connection to data compression (cs.DL). The paper discusses the trade-off between space and time complexity, which is a common theme in algorithms and complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of compressed self-indexes, which are related to data structures and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
