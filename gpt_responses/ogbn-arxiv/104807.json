The use of Mutual Information (MI) is also a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions experiments involving image classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper involves optimization and ranking of feature subsets, which could also be relevant to the subfield of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
