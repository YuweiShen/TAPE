This involves information theory concepts such as channel coding and channel training, making cs.IT a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the integration of the proposed technique with edge learning, which involves training a classifier model using data distributed at edge devices. This makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper mentions the use of a Grassmannian-classification algorithm from computer vision to directly apply the received GAE encoded data to training the model without decoding and conversion. This makes cs.CV a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the need for high-mobility wireless data acquisition in scenarios where edge devices (or even servers) are mounted on the ground or aerial vehicles. This involves networking and internet architecture concepts, making cs.NI a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a solution for high-mobility data acquisition in edge-learning systems, which involves transmitting analog vector data over an antenna array. This involves systems and control concepts, making cs.SY a possible"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
