This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes an automated framework for the decomposition of the CNN, which involves sensitivity analysis of class-specific filters, which could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of hierarchical decomposition and sub-networks could also be related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
