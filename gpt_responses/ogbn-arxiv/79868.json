Specifically, the paper proposes a method for extracting relevant words from a collection of texts and visualizing them in word clouds to allow for a survey of salient features at a glance. This method can be applied to various text datasets, including scientific publications and news articles. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
