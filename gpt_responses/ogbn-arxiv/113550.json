The paper specifically focuses on the use of local image descriptors for VPR, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the trade-off between accuracy and computational effort, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper utilizes standard aerial datasets, which is a common topic in computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
