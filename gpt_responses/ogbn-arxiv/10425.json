Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a bootstrapping method and uses Convolutional Neural Networks, which are common techniques in the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with image processing and feature extraction, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
