This topic falls under the broad area of information theory and communication systems, which is covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. The most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which specifically deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. The paper also discusses the effect of precoding on the coding gain, which is related to the design of communication systems, and hence, it could also belong to cs.COMM (Communication and Networking). The paper proposes a geometric approach for establishing upper bounds on the outage probability, which involves mathematical optimization techniques, and hence, it could also belong to cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper deals with the performance analysis of communication systems, which could also fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
