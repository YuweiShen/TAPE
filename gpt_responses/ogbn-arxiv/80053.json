This involves machine learning and optimization techniques, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of Gaussian-Hermite quadrature for estimation of EIG suggests a focus on numerical methods, which is relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the application of the proposed method to real-world datasets suggests a practical focus, which is relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
