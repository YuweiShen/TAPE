This involves using audio-visual experiences to learn and adapt gaze control strategies without external sensors or human supervision. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses recurrent neural networks and Q-learning to find an optimal action-selection policy, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of audio-visual experiences also suggests that the paper may belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also evaluates the proposed method in terms of its robustness and performance, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper focuses on developing socially acceptable gaze behavior, which suggests that it may belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
