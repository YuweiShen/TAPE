The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for training also suggests machine learning (cs.MM) as a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the need to save computational resources, which could fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of HEVC bitstreams for face detection could also fall under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
