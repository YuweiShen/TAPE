This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of futures as an abstraction for concurrent processes. This is a programming language concept and hence falls under this category.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper presents a recurrence equation for the enumeration of arch processes, which is a mathematical model for concurrent processes. This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the efficiency of algorithms for generating and enumerating runs of arch processes. This falls under the scope of computational complexity.\n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with the structure of concurrent processes and presents algorithms for efficient generation and enumeration of runs.
