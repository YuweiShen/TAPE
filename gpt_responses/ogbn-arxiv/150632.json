The use of obstruction theorems and kernelization techniques also points towards categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The mention of planar graphs and minor-excluded graphs suggests categories such as cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the use of a layering technique similar to the one used by Baker to obtain PTAS suggests a possible connection to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
