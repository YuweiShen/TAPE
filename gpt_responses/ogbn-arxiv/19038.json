Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep neural models also suggests that it could be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the focus on human-computer interaction and game-playing could place it under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
