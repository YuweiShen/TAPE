The paper also presents a dependent type theory, which is a topic studied in programming languages (cs.PL) and computational logic (cs.CL). The paper discusses beta-eta-equivalence checking, which is a topic studied in type theory (cs.TL). Finally, the paper discusses adequacy and canonical forms, which are topics studied in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
