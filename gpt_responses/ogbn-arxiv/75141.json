The paper proposes an algorithm named Fiber Orientation Reconstruction guided by a Deep Network (FORDN) that uses a smaller dictionary encoding coarse basis FOs to represent the diffusion signals and a deep network to estimate the mixture fractions of the dictionary atoms. The paper also uses a larger dictionary encoding dense basis FOs to inform the final FO estimation. Given that the paper deals with deep learning and image processing, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of a deep network, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves signal processing and optimization, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
