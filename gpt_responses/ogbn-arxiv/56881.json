The use of deformable convolutional layers also suggests a focus on improving the network architecture, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve benchmark datasets, indicating a focus on evaluation and performance analysis, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
