The paper also mentions using the approximation for large datasets, which suggests that it may be relevant to \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of polynomial feature representation may also suggest relevance to \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision) and \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) subcategories. Finally, the mention of online or stochastic training may suggest relevance to \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
