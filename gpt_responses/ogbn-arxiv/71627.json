The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method on image classification tasks (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10), which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper introduces a new family of methods for training DNNs, which involves permuting neuron connections, which could also be relevant to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
