The use of a broadcast channel and the study of file-length-per-broadcast-channel-use rate suggest that the paper may also belong to the distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer communication (cs.CC) categories. Finally, the focus on privacy and collusion resistance may indicate a connection to security and privacy in machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
