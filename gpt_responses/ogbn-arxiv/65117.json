This involves techniques from signal processing, estimation theory, and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of information transmission and processing. Other likely categories include cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SP (Signal Processing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which are all relevant to the methods and applications discussed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
