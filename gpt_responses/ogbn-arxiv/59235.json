Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization techniques and algorithms, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with system maintenance and practical implementation issues, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper involves the use of visible light communication, which is a topic in the field of multimedia (cs.MM) and the use of power line communication, which is a topic in the field of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
