The paper also involves computer vision techniques for motion tracking (cs.CV) and machine learning algorithms for sampling-based planning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of motion cones for in-hand manipulation, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
