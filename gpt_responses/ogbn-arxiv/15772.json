The paper discusses the use of self-play and distributed training to achieve superhuman performance, which are key techniques in the field of AI. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper extensively discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques, which are a subset of machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of large-scale training and batch learning, which are common techniques in machine learning. \n3. cs.GT (Game Theory) - The paper discusses the use of self-play and reinforcement learning to achieve superhuman performance in a competitive game. This is a key area of research in game theory, which studies the behavior of rational agents in strategic situations. \n4. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the use of distributed training and continual learning, which are important techniques in robotics. These techniques are used to train robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the development of a distributed training system and tools for continual training, which are key components of control systems. These systems are used to control complex processes and optimize performance over time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
