Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The method also involves end-to-end learning of the network and solver, which suggests it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of radial basis functions and nearest neighbour search also suggests it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on image datasets, indicating it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
