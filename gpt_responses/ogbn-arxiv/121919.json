This is a core area of computer vision research. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper also involves building an inverted indexing scheme to efficiently search through a large database of fashion images. This is a common technique used in information retrieval systems. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with processing and analyzing multimedia data (fashion images) to extract features and find similarities. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may involve using machine learning techniques to train models for feature extraction and similarity matching. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper may involve natural language processing techniques to extract fashion-related attributes from text descriptions of products."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
