It also discusses built-in plasticity mechanisms that modify synaptic weights and dendritic synaptic composition to efficiently train large multi-compartment neurons. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) as it presents a prototype ASIC that implements the extended neuromorphic architecture. \n\nAdditionally, it could be classified under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) as it discusses the architecture of the neuromorphic hardware system. \n\nIt may also be relevant to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as it involves the emulation of complex biological structures and processes. \n\nFinally, it could be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it discusses the training of large multi-compartment neurons using built-in plasticity mechanisms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
