This involves techniques such as full-duplex (FD) jamming receiver, which radiates jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers when receiving the desired signal simultaneously. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
