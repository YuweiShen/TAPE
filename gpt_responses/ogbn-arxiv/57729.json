The proposed method involves optimization techniques, such as alternating minimization, which falls under information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of iterative regularization, which is a technique used in mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
