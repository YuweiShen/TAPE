The paper specifically focuses on the problem of recovering a signal from its phaseless short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements. This problem is closely related to the problem of Fourier phase retrieval, which is a well-studied problem in the literature. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Sound and Music Computing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
