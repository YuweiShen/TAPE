The paper also uses FarsNet, which is a resource for natural language processing (NLP), so cs.CL (Computational Linguistics) is also a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for query expansion, which involves finding similar tokens and expanding the semantic meaning of the query, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), so cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
