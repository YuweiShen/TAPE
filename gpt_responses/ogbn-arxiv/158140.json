The paper also discusses adversarial attacks and defenses, which are relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed method involves a differentiable soft-quantization layer, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization and could be relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.
