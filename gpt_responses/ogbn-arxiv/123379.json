It may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with video analysis. The proposed approach involves graph-based manifold propagation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the approach involves adaptive video structure discovery, which may involve neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
