The paper presents new upper bounds on the additive distortion for these structures on relatively few edges, which is a problem of interest in the field of computational geometry and graph algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from combinatorics and graph theory, which are relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
