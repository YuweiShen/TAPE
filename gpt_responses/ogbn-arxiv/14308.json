It also involves information theory (cs.IT) in the form of communication complexity, as well as algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) in the context of approximating the value of sub-no-signaling games. The paper's results are also related to learning theory (cs.LG) and game theory (cs.GT), as it involves analyzing the behavior of multiple players in a game."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
