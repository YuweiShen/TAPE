This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Multimedia (cs.MM), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), and Information Theory (cs.IT). However, given the focus on video quality and neural network architecture, cs.MM and cs.CV are the most likely categories, followed by cs.AI and cs.NE for the learning-based approach, and cs.IT for the QoE metrics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
