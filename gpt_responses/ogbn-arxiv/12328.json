The use of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy and the Arora-Rao-Vazirani lemma suggests that the paper could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The focus on graph problems and the mention of Vertex Cover, Uniform Sparsest Cut, Balanced Separator, Minimum UnCut, and Minimum 2CNF Deletion suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
