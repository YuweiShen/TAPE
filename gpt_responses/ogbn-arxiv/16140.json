The use of large antenna arrays and directionality also involves signal processing (cs.MM) and system engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implications for cellular operators, which could fall under the category of communication and information theory (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
