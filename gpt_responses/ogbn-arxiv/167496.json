The paper focuses on computer vision applications and provides extensive numerical experiments on standard datasets. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with fraud detection, it may also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
