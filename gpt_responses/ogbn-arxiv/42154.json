This involves designing algorithms and data structures to achieve the desired outcome, which falls under the purview of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the worst-case space complexity of the proposed solutions and provides upper bounds on it. This falls under the domain of computational complexity. \n3. cs.THEORY (Theoretical Computer Science) - The paper deals with theoretical aspects of tile assembly systems, including the design of new systems and the analysis of their properties. This falls under the broader category of theoretical computer science. \n4. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper involves the study of discrete structures (abstract tile assembly systems) and their properties. This falls under the domain of discrete mathematics. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper involves the study of geometric structures (tiles) and their assembly rules. This falls under the domain of computational geometry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
