The paper investigates the cloud-edge allocation of two important network functions for uplink communications, namely the control functionality of rate selection and the data-plane function of decoding. The paper also considers three functional splits, including a new functional split referred to as Fog RAN (F-RAN), with separate decentralized edge control and centralized cloud data processing. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
