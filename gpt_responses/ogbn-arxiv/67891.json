This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with the interference between two communication technologies and evaluates its impact on DSL. This falls under the scope of communications and networking.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper may be relevant to multimedia applications that require high-speed internet access, which can be affected by interference between different technologies.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a statistical model to evaluate the impact of interference on DSL, which can be seen as a control problem.
