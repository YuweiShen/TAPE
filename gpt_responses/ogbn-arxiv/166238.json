The paper proposes a new approach for option discovery based on eigenpurposes, which are intrinsic reward functions derived from learned representations. This approach is applicable to a wide range of RL problems, including traditional tabular domains and Atari 2600 games. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
