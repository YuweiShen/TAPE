The vulnerability of existing distance metrics to adversarial examples is a security concern, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed Adversarial Metric Attack is a methodology for generating adversarial examples, which involves machine learning techniques such as feature learning and optimization, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper aims to facilitate the development of robust feature learning, which is a goal of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
