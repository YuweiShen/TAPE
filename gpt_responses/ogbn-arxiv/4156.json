The proposed method is a general framework independent of the underlying representation learning and has been applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The empirical results are from three very different benchmark tasks of question answering/answer selection. Based on this information, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
