The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of combinatorial problems, which suggests that it could also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of the algorithm for compiling a configuration portfolio, which could be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
