Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions database augmentation and query extension searching, which are related to information retrieval (IR) techniques, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the use of deep learning models and the PaddlePaddle framework suggest that the paper may also fit into cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
