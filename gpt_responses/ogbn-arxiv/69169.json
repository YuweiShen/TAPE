The use of the KYP lemma and LMI optimization also suggests a control-theoretic approach. \n- cs.SP (Signal Processing): FIR filter design is a core topic in signal processing, and the paper explicitly mentions this connection. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not use machine learning techniques, the optimization problem it solves is similar to those encountered in machine learning, and the H-infinity norm is a common tool in robust control and estimation, which are related to machine learning. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The use of convex optimization and LMIs suggests a numerical analysis perspective, as these are common tools in optimization and control theory. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper's focus on practical design of digital filters and its use of optimization techniques suggest a computational engineering perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
