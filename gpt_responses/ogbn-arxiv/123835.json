This technique involves reducing the invocation times of constraint solver by speculatively exploring branches without regard to feasibility. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category, as it deals with program analysis and optimization. Additionally, the paper may also belong to Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories, as symbolic execution is a technique used in both areas. The paper may also be relevant to Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories, as symbolic execution involves constraint solving and control flow analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
