The paper proposes a new approach called Co-teaching+ that improves upon the state-of-the-art Co-teaching method. The paper uses deep neural networks and focuses on improving the robustness of trained models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
