The paper also presents a novel algorithm and a machine learning-based procedure, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the experimental results suggest that the paper may also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) as it deals with the performance of the algorithm on various POMDP instances from the literature."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
