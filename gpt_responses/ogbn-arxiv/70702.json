The paper proposes a general testing technique based on the Fourier transform, which is applicable to all distribution families whose Fourier spectrum satisfies a certain approximate sparsity property. The paper then applies this technique to obtain near sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for several fundamental distribution families, including Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables, Poisson Multinomial Distributions, and Discrete Log-Concave Distributions. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
