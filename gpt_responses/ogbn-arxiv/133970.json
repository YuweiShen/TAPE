The use of word embeddings and Word Mover's Distance suggests a focus on language modeling and information retrieval, which are common topics in the subfield of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper deals with biomedical questions and documents, which could fall under the subfield of Computational Biology (q-bio) or Medical Informatics (cs.HC). However, since the focus is on the methodology rather than the specific domain, it is more likely to be classified under the broader categories of Natural Language Processing (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
