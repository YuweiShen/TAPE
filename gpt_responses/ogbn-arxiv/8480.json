This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The approach proposed in the paper involves uncertainty estimation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of ensembles is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
