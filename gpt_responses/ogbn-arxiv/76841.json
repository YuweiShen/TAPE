The paper also discusses the use of a small fully-labeled subset of medical image volumes to intelligently mine annotations from the remainder, which involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework also includes a multi-view multi-scale lesion proposal classifier, which involves techniques from multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
