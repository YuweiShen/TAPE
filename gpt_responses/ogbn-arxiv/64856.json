This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication theory (cs.COMM). The proposed algorithm involves decoding the received sequence in two steps, which can be seen as a form of distributed systems (cs.DS) or system engineering (cs.SY). The use of CRC codes is also relevant to network protocols (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
