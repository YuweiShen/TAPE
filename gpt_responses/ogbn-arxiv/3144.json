This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper proposes a new modeling approach for contact preintegration in factor graphs, which involves using a hybrid approach that reduces the number of required variables in the optimization problem. This involves using visual information, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV), and the optimization problem is solved using nonlinear optimization techniques, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves proposing a new modeling approach, which involves using a hybrid approach that reduces the number of required variables in the optimization problem. This involves using visual information, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
