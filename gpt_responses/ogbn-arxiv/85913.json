It may also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves searching for categories based on queries. Machine Learning (cs.LG) is another likely sub-category as the paper introduces a new approach for mapping examples to a common semantic space. Multimedia (cs.MM) is also possible as the paper deals with visual domains. Finally, Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not explicitly deal with language, but it may be relevant if the search queries involve text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
