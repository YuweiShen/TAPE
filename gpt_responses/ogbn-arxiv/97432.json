The use of quadratic Gaussian sources and the focus on sum-rate tightness suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves optimization and the use of convex optimization techniques, which may make it relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
