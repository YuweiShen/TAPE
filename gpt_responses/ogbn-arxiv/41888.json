The paper discusses the optimization of the textbook algorithm for determinisation and completion of finite tree automata, which is relevant to the sub-category of formal languages (cs.FL). The paper also mentions applications of the algorithm in static analysis of term rewriting systems and logic programs, which are relevant to the sub-categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The algorithmic optimization involves generating transitions in a compact form, which is relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions checking containment of languages defined by tree automata, which is relevant to the sub-category of symbolic computation (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
