The use of mobile edge computing technology to manage dedicated cache space in the radio access network also involves distributed computing (cs.DC) and information theory (cs.IT). The study of a competitive caching scheme among content providers can be seen as a game theory problem (cs.GT), while the optimization of caching policies based on popularity and availability of contents can be considered as a problem in social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
