The paper discusses a novel method for generating multiple choice questions using crowd workers and leveraging a large corpus of domain-specific text. This involves natural language processing techniques such as document selection and answer distractor choice. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as these sub-categories are closely related to natural language processing. The sub-categories cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DL (Digital Libraries) are also likely as they involve text analysis and information processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
