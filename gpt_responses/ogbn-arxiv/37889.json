The problem is specifically studied on trees and graphs, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the subcategories of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). The use of a mincut classifier and the optimization of the trade-off between number of queries and number of mistakes on non-queried nodes suggest that the paper could also belong to the subcategories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
