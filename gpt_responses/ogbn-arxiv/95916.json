Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses optimization algorithms and geometric quantities, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), respectively. The experiments involve real datasets, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) could also be a relevant category. Finally, the paper provides computational guarantees, which could fall under cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
