This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The paper also discusses the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to optimize the perceptual quality of the images produced, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories.
