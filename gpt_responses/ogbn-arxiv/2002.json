Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses attention-based sequence recognition network, which is a common technique in NLP, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also mentions weak supervision, which is a common topic in machine learning (ML), suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves image rectification, which is a common topic in image processing (IP), suggesting that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for text recognition, which could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
