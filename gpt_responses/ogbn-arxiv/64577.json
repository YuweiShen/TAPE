The paper specifically focuses on the use of observers to support real-time specification patterns, which involves the use of programming languages and logic (cs.PL) as well as formal methods and verification (cs.LO). The application of these techniques is in the context of cyber-physical systems, which involves the integration of software and hardware (cs.SY) and often requires the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to ensure safety and reliability."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
