The focus on performance optimization and hardware-specific analysis suggests a potential fit for computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of multiple hardware architectures and integration with frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch suggests a potential fit for the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
