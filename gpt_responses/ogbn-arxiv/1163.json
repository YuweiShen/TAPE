The proposed framework involves solving a non-zero sum game optimization between an adversary that chooses labels for the data and a model that minimizes the error made by the adversarial labels. The experiments involve training convolutional neural network models to classify image objects with limited access to training labels. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
