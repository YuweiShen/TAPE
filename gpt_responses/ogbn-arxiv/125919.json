The paper also evaluates the system with able-bodied participants and a person with severe quadriplegia. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The system also incorporates multimodal anomaly detection, which suggests Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as additional possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
