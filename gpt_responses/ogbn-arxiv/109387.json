The paper also discusses the end-to-end training of the architecture, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The use of flow fields for propagating deep feature maps is a technique used in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the flexibility and generalizability of the proposed framework, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper validates the proposed framework on large-scale video datasets, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
