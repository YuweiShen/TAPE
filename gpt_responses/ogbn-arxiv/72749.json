The paper also mentions the use of discontinuous activation and loss functions, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The numerical results involve image data, indicating a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the improved robustness of the trained networks, which is a topic relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
