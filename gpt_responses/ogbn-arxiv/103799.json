It discusses nonstandard supervised learning problems, which are less known and have sparse literature. The paper proposes a taxonomy summarizing their traits and reviews common approaches and applications. This falls under the category of machine learning, which is covered by multiple sub-categories in arXiv. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
