This involves using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in simulated environments and then transferring the learned policies to real-world situations. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are both related to the development of intelligent agents. The paper also deals with coordination games and social conventions, which are topics covered by cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of human-computer interaction and the need for agents to act consistently with people, which are relevant to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
