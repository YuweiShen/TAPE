The error probability of the proposed scheme is also derived, which is a common topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the use of a threshold decoder at the receiver, which is a common technique in neural networks. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an adaptive transmitter that adjusts its diffusion rate to reduce the ISI problem, which is a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of molecules to convey information, which can be considered a form of multimedia communication. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed transmitter is a computational system that uses memory to adjust its diffusion rate, which can be considered a form of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
