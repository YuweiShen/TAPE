The use of a binary file and the need for reconstruction suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The two-way communication channel and the need for efficient transmission of information suggest a connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the use of a synchronization scheme suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
