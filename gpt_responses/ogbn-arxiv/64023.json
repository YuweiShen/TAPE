The proposed approach uses shape co-occurrence patterns to represent texture images. This involves learning codewords based on the hierarchical relationships among the shapes in the tree. The paper also investigates three different coding methods for learning the codewords. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
