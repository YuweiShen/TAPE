The use of machine learning techniques for decision-making and communication also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The foraging task and the use of audio communication signals suggest a connection to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the mechanisms and conditions for skillful joint action, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
