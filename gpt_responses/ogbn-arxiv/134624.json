The paper focuses on the optimization of energy efficiency through real-time prediction and optimization. The paper involves the use of long-term traffic flow information and an approximate model reflective of the relatively slow battery temperature dynamics to minimize energy consumption required for battery cooling while maintaining the battery temperature within the desired operating range. The paper also involves the use of scheduled battery thermal and state of charge (SOC) trajectories planned to achieve long-term battery energy-optimal thermal behavior as the reference over a short horizon to regulate the battery temperature. Additionally, an intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH) algorithm is developed to compensate for the mismatch between the actual and predicted driving conditions and reduce the chance for battery temperature constraint violation. Based on the above, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.ET (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
