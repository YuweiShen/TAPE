This framework is based on BERT and graph neural network and achieves a winning joint F1 score on the HotpotQA fullwiki dataset. Given the focus on natural language processing and machine learning, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
