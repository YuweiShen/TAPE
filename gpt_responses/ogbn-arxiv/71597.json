The paper proposes a novel algorithm based on sparse kernel transfer learning and parallel optimization of samples and features. The paper also discusses the use of convolution sparse coding and convolution kernel optimization mechanisms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SD (Sound), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
