The paper also proposes a novel MIMO detection framework, which involves coding theory concepts such as channel coding and minimum distance decoding, making it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SI (signal processing), cs.NI (networking), and cs.SY (systems and control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
