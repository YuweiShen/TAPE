This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and healthcare (cs.HC). The paper also discusses challenges with working with EHR data, such as sparsity and irregularity, which could fall under the category of data management (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper proposes a meta-learning approach for clinical risk prediction, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses a real patient EHR repository for testing, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
