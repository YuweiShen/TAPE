This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as well as information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of real-time stitching algorithms, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA) or systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
