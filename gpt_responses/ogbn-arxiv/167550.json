This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the design of a semi-coherent detection mechanism, which falls under the domain of control systems (cs.SY). The use of RF signals for communication also falls under the domain of communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper provides analytical results for the performance of the system, which involves mathematical analysis and modeling, falling under the domain of mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
