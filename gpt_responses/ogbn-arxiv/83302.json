Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves feature normalization, which is a common technique in machine learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also involves neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
