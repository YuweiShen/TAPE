The paper also discusses algorithms and mechanisms for selecting queries and controlling privacy budgets, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses randomness alignment, which is a technique from information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses how the free extra information can be used to improve the utility of differentially private algorithms, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
