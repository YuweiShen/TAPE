The paper also discusses the placement of operations in dataflow graphs, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC). The proposed method uses a graph neural network, which is a popular technique in neural networks (cs.NE), and the paper evaluates the method on various deep learning models, including image recognition models (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
