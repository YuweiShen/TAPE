The potential applications in clinical diagnosis and forensic investigation suggest a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect to the research. The use of machine learning algorithms for recognition and spotting of micro-expressions indicates a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the review of state-of-the-art methods and challenges in the field suggests a focus on machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
