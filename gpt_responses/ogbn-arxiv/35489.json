This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The approach presented in the paper involves using geometric properties of CAN data to inform two novel detectors, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and data analysis (cs.LG). The IDS is designed to work in real-time with high-speed CAN messages, which implies the use of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for the IDS to be ported to an after-market plugin, which suggests the relevance of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
