The paper also mentions the use of geometric and combinatorial approaches, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG) and combinatorics (cs.DS), respectively. The paper also discusses the use of adjacency matrices, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and graph theory (cs.SI).
