Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves proving inapproximability results, which falls under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Additionally, the use of lift-and-project techniques involves linear programming, which is related to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
