The paper proposes a novel sampling distribution for hyperparameter tuning and evaluates its performance on a large number of datasets. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
