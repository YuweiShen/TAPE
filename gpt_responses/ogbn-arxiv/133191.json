The paper also discusses the connection between UDMs and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.GT). The explicit construction of a class of UDMs and the efficient decoding algorithm also involve algebraic structures, which could fall under the categories of discrete structures (cs.DS) and symbolic computation (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions connections to repeated-root cyclic codes, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
