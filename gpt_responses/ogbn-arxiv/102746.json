The use of frames for redundancy in data representation is a common technique in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves the analysis of random matrices, which is a topic in both numerical analysis and machine learning (cs.DS, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
