The paper focuses on the domain sharing by Jacobs and Langen, which is a topic in logic (LO). The paper proposes a framework with goal-dependent semantics, which is a topic in software engineering (SE). The paper also discusses the precision of the abstract unification operators, which is a topic in formal languages (FL) and artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.PL, followed by cs.LO, cs.SE, cs.FL, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
