The focus on a scalar, discrete-time, time-invariant, linear plant and the use of statistical and information-theoretic tools suggest cs.SY and cs.IT as the most likely categories. However, the consideration of learning-based attacks and the use of machine learning algorithms point towards cs.LG and cs.AI as relevant sub-fields as well. Finally, the emphasis on authentication and watermark-based methods aligns with the scope of cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
