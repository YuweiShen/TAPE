This involves compressed sensing techniques, which are commonly used in the field of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also focuses on the specific application of IoT connectivity (cs.NI) and discusses the use of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.SI) for device detection. Additionally, the paper mentions the embedding of short messages (cs.LG) and coded random access (cs.MM) as related techniques for massive access."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
