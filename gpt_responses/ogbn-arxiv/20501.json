The paper specifically focuses on active learning for regression (ALR) using greedy sampling (GS). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since these sub-categories are closely related to machine learning and regression problems. The paper also mentions experiments on EEG-based driver drowsiness estimation, which suggests a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
