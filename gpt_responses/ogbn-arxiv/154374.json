The focus on self-interested agents and truthful mechanisms also suggests a connection to the subfield of computational social choice (cs.AI). The use of double-peaked preferences and the discussion of how they complement single-peaked preferences suggests a connection to preference modeling and analysis (cs.DS). The use of approximation algorithms and analysis of approximation ratios suggests a connection to the subfield of approximation algorithms (cs.DS, cs.LG). Finally, the use of lower bounds and analysis of the performance of deterministic mechanisms suggests a connection to the subfield of complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
