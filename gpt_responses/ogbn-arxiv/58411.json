Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the implementation of polar decoders on graphical processing units, which falls under the category of cs.AR (Architecture). The paper also mentions the use of polar decoders in embedded-platform processors, which falls under the category of cs.EM (Embedded Systems). The paper also discusses the energy efficiency of the proposed decoders, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the adaptation of the algorithm at various levels, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
