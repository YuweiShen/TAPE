This involves exploiting depth and relative camera pose cues to create a virtual target for the network to achieve. This work is primarily focused on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (LG) techniques, with some aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics (RO) involved in the training strategy. Additionally, the use of depth data from 3D sensors and Structure-from-Motion solutions suggests a potential connection to graphics (GR) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
