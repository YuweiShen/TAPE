The paper also introduces performance metrics and formulates the problem of finding an optimal protocol, which are common topics in information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper applies the framework to wireless local area networks (WLANs), which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
