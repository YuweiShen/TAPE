The paper also discusses the use of determinantal point processes, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS) for diverse sampling. The paper proposes a new method for landmark selection, which involves assigning local covariance matrices to each landmark, which is a technique commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the performance improvement of the proposed method, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
