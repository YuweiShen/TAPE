This involves detecting local Manhattan worlds and refining their headings, which requires computer vision techniques such as feature detection and matching. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed approach is relevant to robotics as it aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual-inertial odometry, which is a crucial component of robot navigation and localization. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions that the headings of local Manhattan worlds are gradually refined by the state estimator when new observations are coming. This suggests the use of machine learning techniques for state estimation. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for state estimation and the overall goal of improving the accuracy and robustness of visual-inertial odometry make this paper relevant to the AI community. \n5. cs.CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper's focus on visual-inertial odometry and the use of computer vision techniques such as feature detection and matching make it relevant to the CVPR community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
