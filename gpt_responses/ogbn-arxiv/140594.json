This involves learning organ-specific appearance and adopting semantically to input data, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The method also involves utilizing under-sampled data and dealing with motion artifacts, which are common challenges in medical imaging (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
