Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication systems. The paper also discusses various SISO and MIMO models, which could fall under cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), respectively. Additionally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and derivations, which could fall under cs.MA (Mathematical Analysis). Finally, the paper discusses the probability density function and cumulative distribution function, which could fall under cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
