This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the model's ability for self-dependent weight adaptation during training, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
