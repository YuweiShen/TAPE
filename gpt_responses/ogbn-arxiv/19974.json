This problem is commonly studied in the fields of distributed computing (cs.DC), algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), game theory (cs.GT), mathematical optimization (cs.MA), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Given that the paper presents new distributed algorithms for the problem, it is likely to be classified under one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
