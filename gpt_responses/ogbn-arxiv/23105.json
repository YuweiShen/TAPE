This involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The proposed system also involves weakly supervised learning (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) for real-world applications. Additionally, the paper mentions data augmentation (cs.MM) to simulate variations in real-world setups. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.RO, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
