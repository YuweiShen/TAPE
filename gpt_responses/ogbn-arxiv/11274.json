The use of partial side information and the derivation of capacity and rate-distortion functions suggest that the paper may also belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the use of convex optimization tools and the formulation of a Lagrange dual as a geometric program suggest that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
