The technical tools used in the paper, such as automata-based compilation and graded DAGs, are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also discusses the complexity landscape of the problem, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
