The paper also deals with structural results, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The use of linear programming relaxations suggests a connection to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
