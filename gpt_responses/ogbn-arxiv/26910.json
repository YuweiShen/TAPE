The paper provides a theoretical analysis of several popular network embedding methods, including DeepWalk, LINE, PTE, and node2vec, and shows that they can all be unified into the matrix factorization framework. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
