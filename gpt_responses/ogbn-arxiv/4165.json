The paper also discusses the use of semantic segmentation and contextual features, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a coarse-to-fine approach, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper focuses on face-related actions, which is a topic commonly studied in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
