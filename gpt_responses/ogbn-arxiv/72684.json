The use of abstraction procedures and formalism to investigate the effects of limitations in sensing suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The application of the proposed method to examples from robotic motion planning indicates that the paper could also be relevant to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of counterexamples and interpolation-based techniques to refine the model and the sensing modalities suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
