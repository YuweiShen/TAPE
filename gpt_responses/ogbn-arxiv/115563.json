Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes advanced approaches to improve the robustness of the model, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The method involves predicting binary codes for each word, which could also be related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions improving decoding speed on CPUs, which could be related to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
