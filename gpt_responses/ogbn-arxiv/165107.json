The use of pipelining and block Markov encoding suggests a focus on system design and optimization, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The mention of noisy networks and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) points towards the field of multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR), where noise and security are important considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
