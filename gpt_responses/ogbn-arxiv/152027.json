This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper involves working with tables and leveraging their content, which suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB). The use of deep learning models such as BERT also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves information retrieval techniques such as encoding feature vectors, which suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
