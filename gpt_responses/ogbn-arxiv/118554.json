It proposes a protocol for Ephemeral Publishing (EphPub) to restrict content availability to an expiration time set by the data owner. The protocol builds on the Domain Name System (DNS) and its caching mechanism. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also proposes an efficient and robust protocol that does not rely on centralized servers or user proactive actions. This suggests that it may also belong to cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper analyzes the caching behavior of DNS resolvers, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper proposes Firefox and Thunderbird extensions and a command-line tool, indicating that it may also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
