This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as object detection and tracking, and machine learning (ML) techniques such as deep learning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG (machine learning) are the most likely categories. Additionally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) processing, artificial intelligence (AI), and information retrieval (IR) techniques such as feature extraction, fusion, and path trimming. Hence, cs.MM, cs.AI, and cs.IR are also likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
