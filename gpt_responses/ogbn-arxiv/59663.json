The paper proposes a learning framework that synthesizes calibrated few-shot classifiers, which is a machine learning problem (cs.LG). The proposed framework also involves adapting classifiers based on incoming training examples, which is a form of adaptive learning (cs.AI). The paper also involves natural language processing techniques to describe the proposed framework (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
