The system presented in the paper employs algorithms and heuristics to navigate through the search space of potential view configurations, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also exploits semantic information expressed via an RDF Schema, which is a common approach in deep learning (cs.DL). The paper focuses on optimizing query response time, which is a common concern in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with view maintenance cost and storage space constraints, which are common concerns in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
