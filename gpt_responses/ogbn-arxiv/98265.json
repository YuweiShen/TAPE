This suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions applications in imaging, radar, and localization, which could fall under the sub-categories of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) or Robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper uses convex optimization techniques, which could place it in the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
