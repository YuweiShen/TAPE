Specifically, the paper proposes a new feature representation called Model Features and shows its effectiveness in transferring knowledge between tasks with varying transition and reward functions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves optimization and control theory, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) as well as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
