This involves aspects of cryptography, network security, and distributed systems, which are all covered by the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the efficiency and scalability of the proposed system, which falls under the cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-categories.
