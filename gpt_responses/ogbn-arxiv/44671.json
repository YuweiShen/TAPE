The algorithm proposed in the paper involves a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of planning in POMDPs is also relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the use of belief state simplification is a technique that is commonly used in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
