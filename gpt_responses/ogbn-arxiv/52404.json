This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of input features, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with data stream problems, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
