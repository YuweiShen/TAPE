This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The proposed strategy involves adjusting the number of active users to balance various gains and inter-user interference, which involves system-level optimization (cs.SY). The paper also deals with multi-user MIMO (cs.MM) and proposes a strategy that can be easily combined with round-robin scheduling, which involves algorithmic development (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
