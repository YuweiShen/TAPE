This falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses LP relaxations and integrality gaps, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
