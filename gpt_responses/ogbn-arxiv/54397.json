The paper proposes a new technique that uses a low-order parametric reflectance model and incorporates strong assumptions about lighting and shape. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also develops new priors about how materials mix over space, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses a large dataset of real objects rendered with different material models under different illumination fields for training and ground truth evaluation, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
