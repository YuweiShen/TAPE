The paper also mentions the limitation of ILP to Horn clauses composed over Boolean variables, which falls under the category of logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper proposes leveraging satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) technology, which is a technique used in automated reasoning and verification, falling under the category of logic (cs.LO) and machine learning (cs.LG).
