The paper also explores two related error models, which involve patterns of deletions, and thus may be relevant to the study of data structures (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the existence of binary codes of positive rate that can correct any fraction of deletions, which may be of interest to researchers in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
