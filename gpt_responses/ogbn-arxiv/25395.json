This problem is a variant of the classical single cache paging problem, which is a well-known problem in computer science and falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves the use of stochastic processes to model the arrival of requests, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of simple policies that require no coordination across the caches, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
