The paper also mentions the use of iterative algorithms and partition and scaling techniques, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and computer security (cs.CR). The study of cyclotomic cosets and their cardinalities is related to number theory and algebraic structures, which are also relevant to computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.CR, cs.DS, cs.SI, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
