It focuses on the development of a rich and expressive reasoning logic and an interactive, tactic-style theorem prover called Abella. The paper also discusses the practical application of the logical machinery it develops. The paper's content is related to several areas of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.LF), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
