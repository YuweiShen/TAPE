The use of Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) suggests a connection to the theory of automata and formal languages, which falls under cs.FL. However, the focus on real-world applications and the use of stock trading data suggest a stronger connection to databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the construction of algorithms and data structures, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the use of lazy evaluation and optimization techniques suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL). Overall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DB and cs.AI, followed by cs.SE, cs.DS, and cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
