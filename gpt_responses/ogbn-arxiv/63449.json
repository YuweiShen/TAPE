Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely category. The paper also deals with propositional, disjunctive logic programs, which are related to logic and set theory (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of the new proof format into modern ASP solvers, which involves software engineering (cs.SE) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the correctness of the proof format, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
