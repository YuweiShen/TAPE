The paper also focuses on the non-deterministic nature of autonomous vehicles, which suggests that it may fall under robotics (cs.RO) as well. The use of machine learning techniques also suggests that it may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the importance of validation and safety, which suggests that it may fall under software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
