The use of nonlinearities and sketching procedures suggests that the paper may belong to the subcategories of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Computer Vision (cs.CV). The use of K-Means clustering algorithm suggests that it may belong to the subcategory of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with large datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the subcategory of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
