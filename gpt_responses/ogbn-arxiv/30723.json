This problem falls under the domain of information theory and communication systems, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.IT and cs.COMM. The paper also proposes a new technique called bit-permuted coded modulation (BPCM), which involves applying bit permutations prior to mapping the polar code to a higher order modulation. This technique is related to signal processing and system identification, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.SI and cs.NI. Finally, the paper uses simulations and density evolution to demonstrate the performance of the BPCM technique, which involves computational methods and algorithms, covered by the sub-category cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
