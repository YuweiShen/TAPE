Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves similarity measurement and clustering, which are common techniques in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (LG) respectively, making cs.IR and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. The use of pre-trained language models and deep learning techniques also suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of contextualized representations, which are a type of neural network architecture, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
