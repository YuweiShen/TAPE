The problem of assigning inputs to reducers with capacity constraints is a well-known problem in distributed computing, and falls under the category of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the optimization of communication costs, which is related to the field of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS) and \"Discrete Mathematics\" (cs.DM). The use of approximation algorithms is also a common technique in \"Computational Complexity\" (cs.CC) and \"Graph Theory\" (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
