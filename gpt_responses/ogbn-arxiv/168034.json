Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves deep learning-based cleaning and transformer-based network, which are related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DL (Deep Learning). The optimization procedure used in the paper can be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the technical drawings themselves can be related to cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
