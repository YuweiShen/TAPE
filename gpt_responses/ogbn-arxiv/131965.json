This is a key area of research in robotics, making cs.RO the most likely category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses visual observations to learn physical primitives and understand an object's appearance. This makes cs.CV a likely category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel formulation that learns physical primitives to explain an object's behaviors in physical events. This is a key area of research in AI, making cs.AI a likely category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a model that learns physical primitives from data. This makes cs.LG a likely category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper studies physical primitive decomposition to better understand how objects behave in physical events. This makes cs.SY a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
