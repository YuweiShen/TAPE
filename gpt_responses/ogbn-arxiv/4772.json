The proposed approach uses coding theory to transform a non-linear MIMO channel to a linear MIMO channel, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also proposes efficient MIMO detection methods using algebraic coding theory, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
