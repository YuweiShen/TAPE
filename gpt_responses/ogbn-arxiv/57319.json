The method involves training a set of neural feature learners and using an implicit neural controller to distribute gradient flows. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
