The paper deals with a new attention mechanism for neural based question answering, which is a common topic in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of a separate network to attain a global embedding of the answer, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The evaluation of the system on a large question answering dataset relates to the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
