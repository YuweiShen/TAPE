This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), and the proposed approach involves interpolation and normalization techniques that are often used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also focuses on shape classification and segmentation, which are common topics in computer graphics (cs.GR).
