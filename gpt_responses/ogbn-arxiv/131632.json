The proposed method involves a novel low-dimensional embedding of visual instances, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of noisy semantic data, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the results are tabulated on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
