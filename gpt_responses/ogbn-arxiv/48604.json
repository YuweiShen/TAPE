This topic is closely related to the field of computer networks (cs.NI) and software engineering (cs.SE), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) since the approach involves using search-based software engineering (SBSE) to reconfigure the IoT network. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed approach in an industrial national emergency management system, which involves the coordination of multiple devices and systems, making it relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
