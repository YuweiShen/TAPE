The paper proposes an algorithm that constructs a logarithmic depth tree on the set of labels to solve this problem. This algorithm is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
