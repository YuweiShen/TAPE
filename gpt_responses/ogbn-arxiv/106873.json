The paper proposes optimal algorithms for constructing Burrows-Wheeler transform, permuted longest-common-prefix array, and LZ77 parsing, which are essential components of many compressed indexes such as compressed suffix tree, FM-index, and grammar and LZ77-based indexes. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
