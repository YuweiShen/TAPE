The use of orthogonal waveforms and spatial orders suggests a signal processing (cs.SP) approach. The paper also discusses the coupling between space and time, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis of wideband random wavefields suggests a potential application in wireless communication systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
