This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. The paper also discusses program analysis and manipulation techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) or Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-categories.
