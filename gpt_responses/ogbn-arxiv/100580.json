The paper presents a new type of submodular functions, called multi-peak submodular functions, and uses them to show hardness of approximation results for several related problems. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.GT (algorithmic game theory) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), which are the most relevant sub-categories for this type of research. Additionally, the paper uses techniques from computational complexity (e.g., NP-hardness reductions) and artificial intelligence (e.g., approximation algorithms), which suggest that it could also be classified under cs.AI and cs.EC (economics and computation). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.CC (computational complexity), given its focus on hardness of approximation results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
