The paper proposes new techniques for constructing fault-tolerant additive spanners, which are important data structures in network routing and distance estimation. The paper uses techniques from graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and distributed computing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NE (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
