The paper introduces a new approach for comparing reinforcement learning policies using Wasserstein distances. This approach involves learning score functions over trajectories and using them to guide policy optimization towards desired behaviors. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
