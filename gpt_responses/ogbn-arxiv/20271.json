These features are incorporated into the construction of the affinity matrix. The experimental results are conducted on widely used datasets such as synthetic shape datasets, UCI real datasets, and MNIST handwritten datasets. The paper's focus on clustering and feature extraction makes it likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
