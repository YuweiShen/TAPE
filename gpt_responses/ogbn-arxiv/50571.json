The proposed method also incorporates prior knowledge about the wavelet representation of the ECG signal, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Finally, the experimental results are obtained using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
