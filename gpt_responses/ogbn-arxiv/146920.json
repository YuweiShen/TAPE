Specifically, the paper proposes a new metric and statistical framework for evaluating gradient norm equality in DNNs. This topic falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
