The paper discusses the challenges of optimizing non-differentiable functions with resource constraints, which is a problem that is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science. The paper also discusses the use of submodularity in the optimization of neural network architectures, which is a topic that is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning, optimization, and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
