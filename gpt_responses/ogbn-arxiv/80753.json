This paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques for stance detection, which are typically covered in the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of multilingual BERT and cross-lingual transfer learning also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of a large-scale dataset and natural language processing techniques may also fall under the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
