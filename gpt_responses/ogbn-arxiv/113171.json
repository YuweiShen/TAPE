This platform is built to provide a scalable solution to the research community to fulfill the critical need of evaluating machine learning models and agents acting in an environment against annotations or with a human-in-the-loop. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.CV, which are all related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. Additionally, cs.CY (computers and society) and cs.HC (human-computer interaction) are also possible sub-categories as the platform aims to facilitate collaboration and participation in AI challenges organized around the globe, which involves social and human factors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
