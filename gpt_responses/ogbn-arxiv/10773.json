This involves interference management and signal processing techniques, which are typically studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and communications (cs.NI), and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also considers practical setups such as wireless powered cooperative relaying and jamming, and wireless powered communication networks, which fall under the categories of control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
