The proposed solution involves optimization and signal processing techniques, which are commonly used in information theory and communication systems. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.COMM are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of beamforming, which is a technique used in signal processing and communication systems. Hence, cs.SI and cs.NI are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a transmission scheme for beam squint compensation, which involves system-level design and optimization. Therefore, cs.SY is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
