The paper proposes a novel method that uses cross-modality attention with semantic graph embedding for multi-label classification. This method involves constructing a label graph and using an adjacency-based similarity graph embedding method to learn semantic label embeddings. The paper also validates the proposed method on two multi-label image classification datasets and a large multi-label video classification dataset. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other possible sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CL (Computation and Language) due to the use of semantic graph embedding and attention mechanisms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
