Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing (NLP) to improve ad matching, which falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The development of a prototype for web pages and ad matching system involves multimedia (cs.MM) and potentially cybersecurity (cs.CR) considerations. Finally, the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve ad matching may also place the paper under the sub-category of DL (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
