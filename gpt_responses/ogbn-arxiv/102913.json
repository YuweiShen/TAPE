Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of ArrayFire tensor library for maximum efficiency, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) and system architecture (cs.AR). Therefore, cs.SD (Software Engineering) is the second likely category. The paper also discusses the comparison of wav2letter++ with other open-source speech recognition systems, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of wav2letter++ to 64 GPUs, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
