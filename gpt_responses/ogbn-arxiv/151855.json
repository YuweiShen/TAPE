The use of codes to achieve better storage cost suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The paper also discusses the inherent limits of storage algorithms, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents a technique for combining erasure-codes with full replication, which could be related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
