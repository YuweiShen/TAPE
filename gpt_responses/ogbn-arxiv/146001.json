Information theory concepts such as maximum-likelihood estimation and multi-hypothesis testing are used in the proposed algorithms. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes algorithms for detecting and localizing multiple targets in a radar system, which can be considered as a control system. The algorithms aim to optimize the performance of the system while minimizing the implementation complexity. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed algorithms involve searching for optimal solutions in a high-dimensional space, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. The algorithms also involve making decisions based on multiple hypotheses, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - Although the paper does not explicitly deal with networking or internet architecture, the proposed algorithms can be applied in wireless communication systems, which are closely related to networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes algorithms that can be implemented in software for processing radar data. The algorithms aim to optimize the performance of the system while minimizing the implementation complexity, which is a common goal in software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
