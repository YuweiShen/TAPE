Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also involves data structures and algorithms for caching, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The system design involves intelligent control and optimization, which can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the implementation of the system on AWS Lambda, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper involves some aspects of architecture and design, which can be categorized under cs.AR (Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
