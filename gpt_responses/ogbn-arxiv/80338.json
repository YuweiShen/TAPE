This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses techniques for approximate distance counting and selection, which are common in algorithms for machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions a connection to semi-continuous Fr\\'echet distance, which is a topic in computational topology and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
