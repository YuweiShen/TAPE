This involves the use of complex activity recognition frameworks to detect pedestrian distractions in real-time. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Cybersecurity (cs.CY), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Machine Learning (cs.MA), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
