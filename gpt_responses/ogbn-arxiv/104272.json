The paper also discusses the use of ${\\epsilon}$-nets, which are a common tool in machine learning and computational geometry (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper's focus on completeness and optimality guarantees also suggests a connection to control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's practical contributions, such as proposing a new sampling distribution, may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) applications in robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
