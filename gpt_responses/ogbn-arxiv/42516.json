This falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of a graph to present the results suggests a possible application of graph-based algorithms, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of query expansion and synonym dictionary formation suggests a possible application in databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
