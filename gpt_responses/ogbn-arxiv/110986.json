Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a method that involves training a CNN and improving its discriminativeness, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions using an ensemble of experts, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on datasets, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
