The paper also discusses Bayesian inverse planning, which is a common technique in machine learning and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses generative models of planning, which is a common technique in computational engineering (cs.CE). The paper also presents a behavioral experiment involving human subjects, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC).
