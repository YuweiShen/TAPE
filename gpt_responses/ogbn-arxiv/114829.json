The paper also mentions the challenges of processing big data streams, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS) and parallel computing (cs.DC). The proposed algorithms and approaches are based on reducing the complexity of processing updates, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
