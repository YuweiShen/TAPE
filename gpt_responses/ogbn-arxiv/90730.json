The use of deep convolutional neural networks also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image and video data. Finally, the use of feature aggregation and fusion techniques suggests that it may also be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
