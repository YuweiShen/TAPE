The use of sparse and low rank decomposition is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and image processing (cs.MM) for denoising and enhancing images. The paper also involves batch alignment of images, which can be related to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the application of these techniques in biomedical imaging can be related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
