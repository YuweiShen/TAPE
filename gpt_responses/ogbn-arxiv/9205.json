The paper presents a linear-time reduction from tree t-spanner in outerplanar graphs to the supply-demand tree partition problem, which is a well-studied problem in computer science and has connections to various other problems such as network flow and matching. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithmic solution to a fundamental problem in graph theory, which involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the problem of computing a tree t-spanner of a graph, which has connections to geometric problems such as distance oracles and spanners. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper presents a reduction from one combinatorial problem (tree t-spanner) to another (supply-demand tree partition), which involves studying the combinatorial properties of these problems. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with the problem of designing efficient algorithms for computing tree t-spanners, which has connections to game theory and mechanism design. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
