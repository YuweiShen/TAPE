The paper also proposes a framework for random access in these systems, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses optimizing terminal activation probability and pilot length, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.MM) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
