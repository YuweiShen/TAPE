The use of a separation oracle suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the study of data structures (cs.DS). The problem of active learning is often studied in the context of machine learning (cs.LG), and the paper's focus on minimizing the number of queries required suggests that it may also be relevant to the study of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
