The paper also introduces a modification to the objective function of the embedding learning algorithm, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of an external lexical resource (Roget's Thesaurus) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the preservation of semantic coherence in the resulting vector space indicates that the paper may be related to neural networks (cs.NE) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
