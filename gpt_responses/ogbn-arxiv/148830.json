The paper proposes a method to regularize deep structures with natural image priors, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves experiments and results, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
