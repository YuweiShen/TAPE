The approach presented in the paper uses a feedforward network with appropriate structure, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) methods. Finally, the paper demonstrates the scalability of the approach to high resolutions, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
