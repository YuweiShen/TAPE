It also involves the use of consensus-based techniques, which are often used in NLP research. \n\nIt could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category because summarization is a common task in IR, and the paper discusses the use of pseudo-relevant summaries to estimate the performance of individual candidate systems. \n\nThe paper's focus on ensemble systems and leveraging the strengths of individual systems suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe use of rankings and the proposed content-based approach could also place this paper in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the use of datasets and experiments suggests that this paper could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
