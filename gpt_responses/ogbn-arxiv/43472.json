The use of a machine learning classifier for modulation and coding scheme selection suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a new approximation for estimating interuser interference, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the study is conducted in the context of the IEEE 802.11ac standard, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
