The paper also discusses social welfare maximization, which is a common objective in mechanism design (cs.AI). The use of lower and upper bounds suggests an algorithmic approach, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the computation of mechanisms in polynomial time, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.SI). Finally, the use of simple mechanisms suggests a focus on practical applications, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
