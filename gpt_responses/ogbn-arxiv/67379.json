The paper also mentions applications in exploratory data analysis (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI), which are related fields. Additionally, the paper discusses explicit expressions for the distances in specific families of processes, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
