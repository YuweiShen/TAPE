Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. The paper also discusses optimizing the system for throughput and latency, which could fall under cs.SD (Software Engineering) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of CNNs and CTC also suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
