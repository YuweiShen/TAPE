The paper specifically focuses on compressing auxiliary variables in optimization algorithms to reduce memory usage. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also mentions using the technique on large-scale datasets, which suggests that it could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
