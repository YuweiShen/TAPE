This involves information theoretic concepts such as channel capacity and signal-to-noise ratio. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with a 5G waveform, CPS-OFDM, which is a communication technology. The proposed method aims to improve the performance of CPS-OFDM signals in terms of spectral regrowth mitigation and spectral efficiency improvement. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimizing the performance of a communication system, which involves control and optimization of various parameters. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a communication technology, CPS-OFDM, which is used in networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with improving the performance of a communication technology, CPS-OFDM, which is used for multimedia applications such as video streaming and audio transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
