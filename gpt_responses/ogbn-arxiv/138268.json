The suffix tree and suffix trie are fundamental data structures for string processing, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also discusses pattern matching, which is a common task in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
