This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new loss function for training the network, which involves exploiting relations within triplets of patches, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper compares the proposed approach to existing methods in terms of performance, memory footprint, and speed, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
