The paper also discusses the broadcast tree model, which has applications in phylogenetic reconstruction and community detection, both of which are topics in data mining (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions phase transitions from statistical physics, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT).
