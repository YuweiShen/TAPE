Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new approach to visual saliency guided by captions, which involves training encoder-decoder networks on caption data. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
