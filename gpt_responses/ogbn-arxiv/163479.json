The paper also emphasizes the importance of depth in neural network design, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of deep neural networks for rotation-invariant function approximation suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the learning capabilities of deep neural networks, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the use of radial functions suggests a potential application in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
