Information theory is closely related to the study of efficient transmission and coding of information, making this category the most likely fit. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on video multicast, which falls under the multimedia category. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a scheme for video multicast over NOMA-based systems, which is related to networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper discusses power allocation and chunk scheduling, which are related to signal processing. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not directly deal with computer vision or pattern recognition, the proposed scheme involves video transmission, which is a common application of computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
