This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the downlink of a single-cell MaMIMO system, which involves networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the benefits of rate-splitting in multiuser multiple antenna systems, which can be applied to social and information networks.\n4. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes novel expressions for the spectral efficiency achieved in the downlink by a single-layer RS strategy, which is related to communications and networking.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the downlink of a single-cell MaMIMO system, which can be used for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
