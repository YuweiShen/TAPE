The authors demonstrate the impact of such attacks on a PdM system and evaluate the resiliency of different DL algorithms. This makes cs.CR the most likely category for this paper. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses three state-of-the-art DL algorithms, LSTM, GRU, and CNN, for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a turbofan engine using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. The authors also evaluate the accuracy and resiliency of these models under false data injection attacks. This makes cs.LG a likely category for this paper. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses DL algorithms for predictive maintenance and evaluates their performance under cyber-attacks. This makes cs.AI a likely category for this paper. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper focuses on PdM systems and their vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The authors evaluate the impact of false data injection attacks on the accuracy and resiliency of DL-based PdM models. This makes cs.SY a likely category for this paper. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the impact of cyber-attacks on PdM"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
