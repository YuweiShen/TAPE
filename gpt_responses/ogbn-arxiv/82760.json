Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel training scheme and an adaptive multi-modal reasoning module, which involve machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, respectively.
