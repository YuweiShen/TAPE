Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.RO (Robotics), as the paper discusses the application of the proposed algorithm in controlling agents and environments. The paper also involves the use of control theory, which suggests the possibility of cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a sub-category.
