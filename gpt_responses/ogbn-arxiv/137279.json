The use of data structures and algorithms to preprocess the graphs and enable efficient searches also points towards the data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM) sub-categories. The specific applications mentioned in the abstract, such as constructing Voronoi diagrams and solving the stabbing circle problem, suggest that the paper may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.GR) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
