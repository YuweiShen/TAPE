Specifically, the paper focuses on stochastic mirror descent algorithms and their convergence, implicit regularization, and generalization properties. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also experiments on standard image datasets and network architectures, indicating a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
