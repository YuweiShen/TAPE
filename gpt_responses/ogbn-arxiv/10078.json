The paper also discusses various machine learning techniques used for this task, such as regression-based methods and deep learning-based methods, which fall under the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions applications such as animation and 3D face modeling, which fall under the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of current methods and potential future directions, which could fall under the subfield of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
