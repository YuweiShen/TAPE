Specifically, it introduces a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR), which is a popular method for this setting. The paper also mentions the use of state-action baselines, which are commonly used in policy gradient reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.LG, which deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper also deals with game theory and optimization, which are covered by cs.GT and cs.RO, respectively. Finally, the paper involves the use of sampling and estimation techniques, which are covered by cs.DS, the data structures and algorithms sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
