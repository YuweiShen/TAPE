Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are likely categories. The paper also uses a Gomory-Hu tree data structure, which is a classic tool in algorithmic graph theory, suggesting cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another possible category. The problem of finding minimum cuts is closely related to network flow and connectivity, which are topics in cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), respectively, making these categories also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
