The paper also discusses the use of temporal logic specifications and policy synthesis, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper proposes a computational scheme for constructing abstractions, which involves mathematical optimization and numerical methods, making it relevant to the categories of machine learning (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
