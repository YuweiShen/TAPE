This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of Multiagent Systems (cs.MA), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), and Computational Geometry (cs.CG). However, since the paper focuses on the optimization of supply diversity for self-assembly of simple objects, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) as it involves the coordination of multiple agents (tiles) to achieve a common goal (self-assembly)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
