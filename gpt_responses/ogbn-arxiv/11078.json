The method involves generating new samples from minority classes using a convex generator, which aims to fool both the discriminator and the classifier. The experiments are conducted on multiple class imbalanced image datasets, indicating that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
