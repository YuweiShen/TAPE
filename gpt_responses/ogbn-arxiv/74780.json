The paper also proposes a novel method for unsupervised learning, which involves training an NMT system using only monolingual corpora. This approach is related to unsupervised learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The model uses attentional encoder-decoder architecture, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
