The use of a correntropy based metric and non-negative constraints on endmembers and abundances suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of optimization techniques to solve the problem suggests that the paper may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
