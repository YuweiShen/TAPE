The paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates linguistic rules and deep learning for sentiment analysis in Persian language. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also uses deep neural networks, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with classification tasks, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
