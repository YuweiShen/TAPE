Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes new models and training methods, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper involves predicting start and end-points for events, which is a task related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper uses TimeML-style annotations, which is a format for representing temporal information, and this is related to neural networks (cs.NE) which are commonly used in NLP and CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
