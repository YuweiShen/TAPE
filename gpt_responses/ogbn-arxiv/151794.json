The use of random modulation and spectrally shaped sequences is a technique used in information theory to mitigate interference. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the design of spectrally shaped sequences, which is a problem in signal processing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method that leverages randomized projection and quantization, which are techniques used in machine learning. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a method for solving an integer optimization problem using a semidefinite program, which is a problem in numerical analysis. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a method for approximating an integer optimization problem, which is a problem in algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
