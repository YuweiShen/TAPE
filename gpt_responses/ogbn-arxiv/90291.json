It focuses on addressing issues related to flash crowds, which can cause severe congestion on a specific operator network while other available capacity from other access technologies is not being used. This topic is closely related to the field of network infrastructure (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM), as it deals with the efficient management of wireless access to multimode terminals. The paper also proposes a distributed solution that is administered by centralized policies, which is related to the field of social and information networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of an embedded reputation system to encourage cooperation among initially selfish operators, which is related to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper analyzes the sensitivity of the handover decision algorithm, which is related to the field of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
