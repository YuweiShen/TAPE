The proposed algorithms are based on determining a local subset of training samples using the underlying geometry of the data. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques for local model learning, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions clustering methods, which could indicate that it belongs to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed methods in image superresolution, which suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
