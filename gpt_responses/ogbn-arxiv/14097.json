The method involves label propagation, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a co-transduction algorithm, which is a technique used in graph-based semi-supervised learning, a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
