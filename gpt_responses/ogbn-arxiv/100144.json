It also uses group theory to study entropy vectors, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also mentions the Ingleton inequality, which is a topic in combinatorics (cs.CC). The use of group theory suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of group theory (cs.GT).
