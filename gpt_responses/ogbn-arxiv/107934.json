It utilizes extended information and algorithms served by Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) to improve advertising performance. The paper proposes a linear programming problem and a multivariable control system to derive the optimal bidding strategy. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also involves empirical studies based on real-world data, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
