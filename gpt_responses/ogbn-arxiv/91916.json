The paper proposes a modification to the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) algorithm, which is a popular object detection algorithm that uses deep neural networks. Therefore, it is likely that this paper would also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, since the proposed modification involves reducing the size of the model, it could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications where computational resources are limited."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
