The paper presents a model predictive control approach for this problem, which involves solving optimization problems with linear constraints at each step. This approach is applicable to a wide range of systems and does not require precise knowledge of the probability distributions of the disturbances. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
