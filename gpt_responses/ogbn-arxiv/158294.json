The proposed technique involves applying case-based reasoning, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves using heuristics to select and reuse partial results, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and optimization (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
