The use of large image data sets and the investigation of performance suggest a focus on deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and deep learning (cs.DL). The task of writer retrieval also suggests a potential focus on natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (cs.CL), while the use of multiple methods and the competition aspect suggest a potential focus on machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
