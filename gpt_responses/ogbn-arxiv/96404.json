The proposed method involves modifying the loss functions, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). The paper also presents experimental results on a popular object detection dataset, which is a common evaluation method in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
