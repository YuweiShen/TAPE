This aligns with the scope of cs.IT, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the scheduling problem in a wireless network where multiple devices aim to send their latest statuses to a central access point via a shared wireless channel. This falls under the scope of cs.NI, which deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer networks and networked systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates the multiuser scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and attains the optimal policy by resolving the formulated MDP problem. This aligns with the scope of cs.SY, which deals with the analysis, design, and control of complex systems. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions that multiple devices can be granted to transmit simultaneously in each time slot, thanks to the extra spatial degrees-of-freedom brought about by the multiple antennas at the access point. This suggests that the system may involve multimedia data transmission, which falls under the scope of cs.MM, which deals with"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
