The analysis of the eavesdropper's probability of correct decision involves mathematical properties of lattices, which is also relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of skewed lattices for increased security introduces a dimensionality reduction aspect, which is related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI, cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
