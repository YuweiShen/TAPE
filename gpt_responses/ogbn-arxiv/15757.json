It also involves text summarization and report generation, which are common topics in this sub-category. Additionally, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories as the paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for generating macro research reports. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible sub-category as the paper involves crawling a large news-to-report dataset. Finally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a less likely sub-category as the paper uses neural networks for text generation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
