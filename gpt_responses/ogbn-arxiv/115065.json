Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of larger corpora and advances in parallel computing, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of language models in computer vision tasks, which could potentially place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
