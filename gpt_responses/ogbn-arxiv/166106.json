Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses video encoding and resolution, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The optimization of transmission power and bandwidth constraints falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also presents a distributed iterative algorithm, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the prioritization of packet transmissions, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
