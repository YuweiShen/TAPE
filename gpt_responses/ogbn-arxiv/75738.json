The approach proposed in the paper involves using linear approximations of the nonlinear system, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for model selection and feature extraction. The paper also discusses the use of closed loop block oriented models, which is a topic related to system identification (cs.SI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
