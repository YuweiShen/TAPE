The paper also considers the impact of system conditions such as load, received powers, and interference, which are relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of Rayleigh fading and path loss channel models suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, which often deal with signal processing and statistical modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
