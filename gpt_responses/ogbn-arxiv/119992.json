This involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques such as object detection and spatial-temporal relations, as well as machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG) techniques such as Graph Convolutional Networks for reasoning on the graph representation. The paper also evaluates its method on video datasets (cs.MM) and mentions its potential applications in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
