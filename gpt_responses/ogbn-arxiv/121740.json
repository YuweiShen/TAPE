This involves analyzing large datasets of mathematical proofs and developing new algorithms for automated reasoning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper also involves natural language processing techniques, which could place it in cs.CL (Computation and Language) and computer vision techniques, which could place it in cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
