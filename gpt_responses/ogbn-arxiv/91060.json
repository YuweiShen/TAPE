Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely category. The paper also uses optimization-based search, which falls under cs.LO (Optimization and Control). The use of automata-based verification suggests cs.PL (Programming Languages) as a possible category. The paper also deals with temporal logic, which is a topic in cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
