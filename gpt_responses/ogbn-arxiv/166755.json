The paper also proposes a tool that combines advances in database technologies and cryptographic tools, which suggests that it could also fall under the categories of databases (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper mentions the use of signal processing fundamentals for computation, which could suggest that it falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of security on key signal processing kernels, which could suggest that it falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
