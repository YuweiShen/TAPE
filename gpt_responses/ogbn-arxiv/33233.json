The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the proposed code, which is related to networked and internet systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper focuses on MIMO systems with 4 transmit and 2 receive antennas, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COM) systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
