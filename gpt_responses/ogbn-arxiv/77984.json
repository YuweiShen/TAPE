It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as pose estimation is a crucial task in robotics. The use of anchor points and regression networks suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of ResNet-50 as the backbone network suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
