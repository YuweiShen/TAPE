The specific application of the proposed framework is for age prediction in face images, which is a common task in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the limitations of commonly used loss functions and proposes a new framework, which involves theoretical guarantees and optimization techniques, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the proposed method involves the use of face image datasets, which is a common application in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
