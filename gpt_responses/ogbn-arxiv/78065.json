The focus on identifying the type of the opposite agent and addressing non-stationary environments suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of probing policies to approximate the stationary policy of the other agent suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The application of these policies to handle multi-agent environments suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) or control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
