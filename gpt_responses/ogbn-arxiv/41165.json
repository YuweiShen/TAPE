GSP is a multidisciplinary field that intersects with several areas of computer science, including machine learning, optimization, and information theory. The paper proposes a novel method for distributed processing of graph signals using Chebyshev polynomial approximations, which involves techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
