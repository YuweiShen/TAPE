This is a typical problem that falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n2. cs.RO - The paper proposes a heuristic algorithm for solving the nurse scheduling problem. This is a typical problem that falls under the scope of robotics and automation. \n3. cs.LG - The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for solving the nurse scheduling problem. This is a typical problem that falls under the scope of machine learning. \n4. cs.CE - The paper proposes a computational approach for solving the nurse scheduling problem. This is a typical problem that falls under the scope of computational engineering. \n5. cs.DS - The paper proposes a data-driven approach for solving the nurse scheduling problem.
