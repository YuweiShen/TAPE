The paper also discusses the need for robots to develop their own way of perceiving, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a retina and sensorimotor data to learn spatial configuration involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of invariants in sensorimotor laws, which is a concept commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
