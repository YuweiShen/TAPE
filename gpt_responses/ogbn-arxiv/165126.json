The paper compares recursive neural models with sequential recurrent neural models, which are commonly used in deep learning for various tasks, and evaluates their performance on four different NLP tasks. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as well, as these sub-categories also deal with deep learning models and their applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
