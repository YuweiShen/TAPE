The proposed solution involves soft pilot reuse and multi-cell block diagonalization precoding. The paper discusses the theoretical analysis and simulation results of the proposed solution. The topic of the paper is related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communication (cs.COM). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
