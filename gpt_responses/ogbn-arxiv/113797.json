The mention of a \"cognitively grounded model\" suggests a focus on cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing). Additionally, the mention of \"formal account\" suggests a focus on mathematical modeling, which could fall under cs.CY (Computational Geometry) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
