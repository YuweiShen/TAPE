The paper focuses on comparing different algorithms for estimating the reward function in IRL, which is a common problem in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
