The techniques used in the paper involve hypergraphs and LP relaxations, which are commonly used in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves some graph theory and combinatorial optimization, which could make cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) relevant sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
