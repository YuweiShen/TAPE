The paper proposes an end-to-end network that learns discriminative representations for both visual and semantic instances of ZSL, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of attributes, which is a common approach in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two challenging ZSL datasets, which involves multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
