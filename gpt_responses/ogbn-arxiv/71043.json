The use of metrics to determine the perfect codes is related to coding theory (cs.CC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper also discusses procedures to obtain new perfect codes, which could be related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
