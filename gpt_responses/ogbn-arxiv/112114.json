The paper also introduces a combinatorial family of extremal privatization mechanisms, which involves optimization problems and information theory, making it relevant to the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem, which is related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
