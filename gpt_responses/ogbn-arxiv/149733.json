The use of a broadband sliding correlator channel sounder suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of highly directional antennas and path loss models suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and augmented reality (cs.AR). Finally, the use of statistical analysis and modeling suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
