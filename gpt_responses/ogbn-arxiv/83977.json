Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the usage of different normalization techniques, which falls under the category of machine learning, specifically deep learning, hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also likely. The paper also deals with analyzing the performance of different models, which falls under the category of multimedia, hence cs.MM (Multimedia) is also likely. The paper also discusses the comparison of different models, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also likely. Lastly, the paper deals with anomaly detection, which falls under the category of cryptography and security, hence cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
