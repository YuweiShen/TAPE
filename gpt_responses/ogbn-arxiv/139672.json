The paper focuses on improving the efficiency of DNNs, which is a key concern in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves continuous growth and pruning, which is a technique that is commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on representative datasets, which is a common practice in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
