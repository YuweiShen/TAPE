The use of the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) and the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation suggests a focus on optics and photonics (cs.OH) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses spectral efficiency, which is a topic in physical-layer communication (cs.PH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
