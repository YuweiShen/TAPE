Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper discusses challenges in the automatic identification of epistemic activities using AI methods, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also focuses on improving students' diagnostic reasoning skills, which could place it in cs.ED (Education) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
