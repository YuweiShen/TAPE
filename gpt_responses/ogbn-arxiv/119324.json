The use of local search is a common technique in approximation algorithms, which suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a likely sub-category. The problems studied involve planar graphs and Euclidean spaces, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as possible sub-categories. The paper also mentions minor-closed families of graphs, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the use of cost functions that are the $p$-th power of the shortest-path distance suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
