The paper discusses techniques for creating indexes on HDFS data blocks and improving the performance of MapReduce jobs. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Databases (cs.DB), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). However, given the focus on distributed computing and data management, we believe that cs.DC and cs.DB are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.DS, cs.IR, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
