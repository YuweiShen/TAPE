Therefore, cs.CV and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces a novel mechanism for learning the redundancy relationship between hashing bits, which involves training a deep neural network, indicating that cs.LG and cs.NE are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper conducts experiments on four datasets, suggesting that cs.MM could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
