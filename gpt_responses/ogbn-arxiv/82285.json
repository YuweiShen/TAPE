The paper also discusses the semantics of the language using \"ideal relations\" between partial orders, which is a topic in logic and set theory (cs.LO). The second semantics discussed in the paper is motivated by its potential use with separation algebra, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions pointfree relation calculi, which is a topic in functional programming (cs.FL), and refinement calculi, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
