This topic falls under the intersection of several subfields of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), programming languages (cs.PL), and systems and control (cs.SY). Given the focus on automata and formal methods, cs.LO and cs.DM are the most likely categories. However, the application to MDPs and reinforcement learning suggests cs.AI and cs.SY as additional possibilities, while the use of state-space reduction techniques points to cs.PL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
