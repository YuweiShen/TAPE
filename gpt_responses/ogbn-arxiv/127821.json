The paper also discusses the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM), which involves multiple access (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes an efficient MU-MBM signal detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms, which involves multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
