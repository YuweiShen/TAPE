The focus is on Annotation Graphs, a graph model for annotations on linear signals such as text and speech, which can be efficiently stored and queried using database techniques. This suggests a strong connection to the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and databases (cs.DB). The paper also discusses the generalization of the model to encompass a wider variety of linguistic signals, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
