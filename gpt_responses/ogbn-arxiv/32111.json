It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes novel models for learning latent representations of sentences using neural models. Additionally, it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it discusses the effectiveness of the proposed models in information system tasks. Finally, it could belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as it uses a language network to represent inter-sentence relations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
