This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the complexity of the network codes, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents results that are more general or tighter than existing bounds, which is related to statistical theory (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
