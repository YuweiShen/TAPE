The paper proposes a new method for improving sample efficiency in multi-task RL by using inverse RL, which is a technique for inferring reward functions from observed behavior. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses experiments in different domains, such as goal-reaching and linear reward functions, which suggest that it could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
