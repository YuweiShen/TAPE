This task falls under computer vision, which is covered by the cs.CV sub-category. The use of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and regularized landmark mean-shift (RLMS) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on facial images and landmarks may also make the paper relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
