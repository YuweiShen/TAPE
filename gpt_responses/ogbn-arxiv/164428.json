The problem of finding a subcomplex homeomorphic to a 2-sphere is related to topological graph theory and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of parameterized complexity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity theory (cs.CC) in its analysis of the hardness and running time of the algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
