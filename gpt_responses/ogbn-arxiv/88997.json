DPPs have gained prominence in several applications that rely on diverse subsets, which suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the computational complexity of core tasks such as sampling and learning, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes batch and stochastic optimization algorithms for efficiently learning the parameters of KronDPP, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
