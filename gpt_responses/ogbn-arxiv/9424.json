The approach involves modifying the architecture and training procedure of CNNs, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the implementation of the approach on mobile computing platforms, which relates to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
