Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel two-task network with a new loss function, which involves training the network to predict pixel-by-pixel labeling and generating word proposals using connected component analysis. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed network on public benchmark datasets, which indicates that it may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
