The paper specifically focuses on the classification of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). The techniques developed in the paper involve approximation of activation functions, which could also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper involves experimental results and analysis, which could also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
