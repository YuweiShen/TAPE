The use of weights to reflect the robot's chance of successfully executing motions involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and the modification of the knowledge retrieval procedure involves graph theory (cs.LG). The proposal of human-robot collaboration (HRC) also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and the overall approach can be seen as a system-level solution (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
