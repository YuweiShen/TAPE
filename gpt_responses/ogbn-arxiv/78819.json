The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to solve the controller synchronization problem, which involves training a smart controller synchronization policy using deep neural networks (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of Markov Decision Process (MDP) also suggests that the paper may fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's focus on distributed SDN and network domains may also suggest the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
