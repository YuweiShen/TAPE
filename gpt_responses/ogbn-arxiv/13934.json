This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper compares deep learning approaches with classical regression methods, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of hand-crafted features and radiomic features suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of Support Vector Classifier (SVC) suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of non-imaging clinical patient information suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
