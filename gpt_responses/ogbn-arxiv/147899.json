The paper characterizes pure Nash equilibria of the resulting strategic games and studies the complexity of related computational problems. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper studies the behavior of lazy and truth-biased voters under different tie-breaking rules, which is relevant to the design of voting systems and decision-making algorithms. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper investigates the computational complexity of related problems, such as computing the PNE of the strategic games. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses game-theoretic models to study the behavior of voters, which is relevant to the design of learning algorithms that can predict or influence voting outcomes. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper studies the behavior of multiple agents (voters) in a social choice setting, which is a classic topic in multi-agent systems research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
