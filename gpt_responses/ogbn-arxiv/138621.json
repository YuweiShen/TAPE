The focus on information-theoretically optimal compression suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) category. The use of separator decomposition and planarizers suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the algorithms and complexity (cs.CC) category. Finally, the mention of hereditary classes of graphs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
