The proposed decentralised approach also involves the use of distributed ledger technology, which is a common topic in the cryptography and security subfield. \n\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper takes a human rights perspective on digital identity, which is a topic that falls under the computers and society subfield. The proposed approach also aims to empower individuals to manage their personal information, which aligns with the focus of this subfield. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed decentralised approach involves the use of distributed ledger technology, which is a key topic in the distributed computing subfield. \n\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the management of personal information, which is a topic that falls under the databases subfield. The proposed approach also involves the use of standards-based protocols, which is a common topic in this subfield. \n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The proposed approach involves the development of a new architecture for digital identity, which is a software engineering problem. The paper also discusses the need for thoughtful regulation, which is a topic that falls under the software engineering subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
