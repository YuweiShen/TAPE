Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (convnets) is a common technique in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves a completely data-driven approach, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe use of a loss function to measure the Euclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and the ground truth indicates that this paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe training of end-to-end architectures that are both fast and accurate suggests that this paper may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the use of large datasets of saliency prediction suggests that this paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
