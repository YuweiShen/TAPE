This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses a method for quantifying NNS patterns in infants, which can be useful for assessing their central nervous system development. This has implications for human-computer interaction in the context of healthcare and infant monitoring.\n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the synchronous coordination and neural integration of facial muscles and cranial nerves required for completion of the sucking action. This falls under the domain of neural computing.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for quantifying NNS patterns using facial gesture analysis. This involves the use of machine learning algorithms for facial landmark tracking and signal processing.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses a method for contact-less NNS data acquisition, which could have applications in robotics for developing non-invasive sensing and monitoring systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
