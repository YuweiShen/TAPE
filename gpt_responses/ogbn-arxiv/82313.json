This makes it likely to belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. The paper discusses polyhedral aspects of submodularity, which is a topic that falls under the scope of computational geometry. The paper also discusses optimization and approximation algorithms, which are relevant to machine learning and computational complexity. Finally, the paper deals with mathematical properties of submodular functions, which is relevant to discrete mathematics and information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
