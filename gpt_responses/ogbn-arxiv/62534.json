This involves the use of integer programming and unit resolution adapted to Max-SAT. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the development of a new Max-SAT solver that incorporates original inference rules, which can be seen as a form of AI. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new inference rules for Max-SAT, which involves the development of new algorithms and data structures. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of integer programming, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with Max-SAT, which is a problem in discrete mathematics. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper deals with the development of a new Max-SAT solver that incorporates original inference rules to transform Max-SAT instances into equivalent instances that are easier to solve, which is related to computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
