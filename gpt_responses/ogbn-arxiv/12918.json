The paper proposes a Pose Agnostic Cross-spectral Hallucination (PACH) approach to disentangle the independent factors and deal with them in individual stages. The paper primarily focuses on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (LG) techniques to solve the problem of HFR. The paper also utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to align the near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) images in a generative way. The paper also deals with multimedia (MM) techniques to accomplish complexion control and generate more realistic VIS images. Finally, the paper uses neural networks (NE) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-spectral HFR. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
