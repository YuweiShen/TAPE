The paper also involves computational complexity analysis and information theory (cs.IT), as well as data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper may also involve machine learning (cs.LG) as it discusses finding multicollisions, which is a problem that is harder than finding multiclaws, a problem that is relevant in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
