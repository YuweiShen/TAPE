The approach involves building an open loop action plan, which can be used in both Markov and partially observable Markov domains, indicating a focus on reinforcement learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of video data on observation sequences suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the exploration of repeated structure in procedures suggests a possible connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
