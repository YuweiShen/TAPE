The focus is on acyclic networks, which are a type of network topology (cs.NI). The paper also discusses field size issues, which are related to coding theory and algebraic structures (cs.DC). The paper mentions the need for memory and processing power at nodes and sinks, which are topics in systems and networking (cs.SI).
