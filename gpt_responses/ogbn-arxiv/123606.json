It draws on research in CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) and critical data studies, which are both subfields of CS that focus on the intersection of technology and society. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper describes the practices and challenges of data science work from an ethnographic perspective, highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science. This suggests a focus on the human aspects of data science, such as communication, coordination, and sensemaking, which are central to the field of HCI. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): While the paper does not explicitly address security or privacy concerns, it touches on issues of credibility and trustworthiness of data, which are relevant to the field of cryptography and security. In particular, the paper discusses how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper examines the social and organizational dynamics of data science work, including the role of collaboration, negotiation, and translation in managing trust. This aligns with the focus of the subfield of social and information networks, which studies the structure and function"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
