The paper also discusses polynomial solvers, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The proposed technique for converting resultant constraints to eigenvalue problems may also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of sparse resultant-based methods may be of interest to researchers in the field of data structures (cs.DS) who are interested in efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
