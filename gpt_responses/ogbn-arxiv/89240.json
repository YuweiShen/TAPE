Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses modifications and parallelizations of heuristics and efficient geometric encodings and data structures, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The paper also mentions solving benchmark instances, which suggests that it may belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
