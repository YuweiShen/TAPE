The paper also discusses the use of robotics in industrial automation (cs.RO) and the ethical and social implications of such systems (cs.CYBER). The paper proposes an integrated methodological design approach that involves measuring the operator's status and adapting the interaction accordingly, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems integration (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
