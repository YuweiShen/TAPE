The use of correlation filters and adaptive distraction context awareness also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the use of video sequences suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the tracking of objects in video sequences suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
