The paper presents a mapping from Fusion Calculus and Synchronized Hyperedge Replacement into logic programming, which suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of logic programming (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses graph transformations, which are commonly used in the area of distributed computing (cs.DC), and the relationships between different formalisms, which is a topic of interest in software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
