This involves learning high-level, temporally abstracted macro-actions of varying lengths solely from data without any prior information. The paper also demonstrates the generality of the approach by showing that it can be applied to any sequence data, such as text prediction. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
