Specifically, it proposes a model that uses convolutional neural networks with attention mechanism and sparse feature vector to rank candidate answers based on their semantic and syntactic similarity to the question. This topic falls under the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
