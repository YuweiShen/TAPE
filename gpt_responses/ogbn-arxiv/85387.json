The proposed pattern generation strategies involve generating variations in the shape and structure of the expressions, which could also be considered as a form of data augmentation, and hence could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions converting online expressions to images for offline recognition, which could be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
