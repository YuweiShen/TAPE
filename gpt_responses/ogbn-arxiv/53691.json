This is a common problem in natural language processing (NLP) and falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes quantum-inspired models, which involve complex numbers, and achieve better performance than non-quantum models. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
