The paper specifically focuses on word-embedding techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE).
