This involves analyzing the impact of the scheduler on the closed-loop system in the presence of traffic, and finding a certainty equivalent controller. These topics are related to the fields of control systems (cs.SY), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.MA), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY, followed by cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.MA, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
