The use of Gaussian Processes and probabilistic modeling indicates that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper involves knowledge transfer between classes, which is a common topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The use of embeddings and representation learning suggests that it may also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category.
