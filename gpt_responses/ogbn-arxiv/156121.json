However, since the focus is on MCIL, which is a subfield of machine learning, we can reasonably assume that cs.LG is the most likely sub-category. The use of image classification benchmarks also suggests cs.CV as a likely sub-category. The mention of bilevel optimizations and end-to-end training suggests cs.AI and cs.NE as possible sub-categories. Finally, the mention of boundaries between classes suggests cs.CL as a possible sub-category, although it is less likely than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
