The paper also proposes a new measure, APSyn, which involves weighting context relevance, indicating a potential connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of APSyn against Vector Cosine, which is a widely used measure in natural language processing (NLP) and could be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
