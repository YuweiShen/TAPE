This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses a multi-instance learning framework with LSTM network and bootstrap aggregation method for model ensemble. This indicates the use of machine learning techniques.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper deals with predicting human engagement, which is a key aspect of human behavior and falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper deals with predicting engagement intensity of students while watching online MOOCs videos, which is related to human-computer interaction.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with analyzing engagement intensity of students while watching online MOOCs videos, which involves the use of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
