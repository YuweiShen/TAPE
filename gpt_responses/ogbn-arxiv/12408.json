This involves using domain knowledge to guide the modeling process and to identify correlative, complementary, and domain-specific semantics of the dependencies in the data. The approach is aimed at improving diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease and making clinical predictions. Given the focus on machine learning and probabilistic modeling, as well as the use of medical data, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
