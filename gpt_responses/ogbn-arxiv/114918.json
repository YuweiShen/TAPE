The proposed algorithm, AdaSearch, involves global trajectory planning and confidence intervals, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The problem of identifying the strongest emitter(s) of a signal in the presence of background noise can also be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) subfields, as these areas often deal with signal processing and noise reduction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
