The paper also uses tools from information theory, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to derive the bounds. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper is primarily concerned with the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by noise, which is a core problem in signal processing. The paper also discusses the design of local estimators for distributed estimation problems, which is a common problem in signal processing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the problem of finding estimators that are robust against deviations from the assumed input distribution, which is a common problem in machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to constrain the input distribution, which is a common tool in machine learning. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by noise is relevant to multimedia applications such as image and audio processing. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the design of local estimators for distributed estimation problems, which is a common problem in networking and sensor networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
