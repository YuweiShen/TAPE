The use of linear-time algorithms suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper mentions the concept of forbidden configurations, which is a common theme in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
