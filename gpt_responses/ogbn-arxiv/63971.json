The paper also proposes a novel approach to improve the accuracy of GEC, which involves building a classifier to score the edits in the n-best hypotheses generated by an SMT approach. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which are closely related to the development of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques. Finally, the paper may also belong to the sub-category cs.CY (Computers and Society), as it deals with the impact of technology on language learning and education."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
