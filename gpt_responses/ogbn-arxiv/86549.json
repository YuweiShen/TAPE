It proposes an autoencoding formulation to discover landmarks as explicit structural representations. The paper uses deep neural networks and proposes an end-to-end differentiable framework. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with unsupervised learning, which is a common topic in the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also uses constraints to ensure the validity of landmarks, which is a topic in the sub-category cs.GR (Computer Graphics). Finally, the paper uses deep neural networks, which is a topic in the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
