The paper proposes a novel reward bonus that is a function of the posterior distribution over environments, which is a Bayesian approach to RL. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also deals with sample complexity, which is a topic in the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control), and the exploration task involves structured priors, which is a topic in the sub-category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
