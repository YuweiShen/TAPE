The algorithm presented in the paper uses topological tools such as the fundamental groupoid, which suggests a connection to algebraic topology (cs.AT) or computational geometry (cs.CG). The problem of finding paths in a complex can also be viewed as a graph theory problem (cs.GT) or a computational complexity problem (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in the abstract suggests a possible connection to logic and computation (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
