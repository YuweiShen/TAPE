This falls under the domain of game theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of graphs to model the game and the importance of tie-breaking mechanisms, which are both topics that fall under data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses formal methods to model the interaction between a non-terminating system and its environment, which is a topic that falls under logic in computer science.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses bidding games, which are a type of game that can be used to model interactions between agents in artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the use of graphs to model the game could potentially fall under computational geometry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
