The paper also discusses the capacity of the network under different scenarios, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the problem of ensuring secrecy in the presence of an adversary, which is a key problem in cryptography and security. The paper also discusses the effect of causality and feedback on the capacity of the network, which is relevant to the study of secure communication. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of communication over a multi-path network, which is a key problem in networking and internet architecture. The paper also discusses the effect of jamming on the network, which is relevant to the study of network security. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the problem of ensuring reliable communication in the presence of an adversary, which is a key problem in systems and control. The paper also discusses the effect of feedback on the capacity of the network, which is relevant to the study of control systems. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper assumes transmissions are in the large alphabet regime, which is relevant to the study of multimedia communication.
