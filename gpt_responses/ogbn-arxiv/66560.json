The paper also discusses the use of fuzzy extractors and secure sketches, which are techniques that involve information theory (cs.IT) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper provides efficient constructions for these primitives, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
