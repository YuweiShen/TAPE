The method proposed in the paper involves embedding high-dimensional sparse labels onto a lower-dimensional dense sphere, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using cosine proximity regression, which is a technique used in information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper deals with large-scale datasets, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
