However, the focus is on the case where the input and output spaces are infinite dimensional, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA), optimization and control (math.OC), and functional analysis (math.FA). The use of topological conditions on the input space also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the study of topological data analysis (math.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
