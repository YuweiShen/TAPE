The paper also proposes a new framework for compression, which involves analyzing the model and using tolerances to perform fine-grained compression. This involves active learning, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for streamlined methodologies for deploying models on edge devices, which is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper's focus on compression and hardware flexibility suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
