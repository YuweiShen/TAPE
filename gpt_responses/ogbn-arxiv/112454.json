The paper also considers the selection of participating nodes in heterogeneous networks, which involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system design (cs.SY). The paper proposes algorithms and techniques to enhance the node selection process, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
