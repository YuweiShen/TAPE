It provides tight asymptotic bounds on the tradeoff between the central parameters of feature hashing and complements it with empirical data. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). However, given the focus on machine learning and the use of feature hashing, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.DS and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
