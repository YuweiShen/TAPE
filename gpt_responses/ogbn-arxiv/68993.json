Additionally, the proposed method involves designing a novel module and loss function, which suggests that it may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of feature pyramid networks and the focus on small object detection may also make it relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the experiments involve a dataset related to traffic signs, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
