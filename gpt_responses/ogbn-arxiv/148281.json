The paper also discusses the impact of false negatives on the training of the discriminator, which is a key component of adversarial imitation learning. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to subfields such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY), which are all related to machine learning and may involve training agents to perform tasks in complex environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
