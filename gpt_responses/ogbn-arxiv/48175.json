The error analysis and categorization of errors involve natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of attention-based models and evaluation using text-based similarity metrics suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
