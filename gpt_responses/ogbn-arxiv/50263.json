This involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the implementation of the framework in Python using scikit-learn (cs.AI) and evaluates it over different datasets (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of resource efficiency, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
