Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes revised and decentralized versions of prioritized planning algorithms, which involve artificial intelligence and distributed computing, respectively, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) likely sub-categories as well.
