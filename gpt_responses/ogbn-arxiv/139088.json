The proposed digital layered transmission scheme involves time layering and superposition, which are common techniques in signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different transmission schemes, which could be relevant to communication theory (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
