The use of graphical models and network analysis techniques further supports the likelihood of the paper belonging to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) sub-categories. Additionally, the mention of memory effects and relocation decisions suggests a potential focus on cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) or machine learning (cs.DL) applications. Finally, the use of geographical data and analysis of career trajectories may also suggest a potential fit for the cs.CE (Computational Geometry) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
