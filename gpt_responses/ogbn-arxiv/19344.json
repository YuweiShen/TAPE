Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves network infrastructure and communication protocols, which suggests the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The use of blockchain technology implies the category cs.Distributed. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability of the proposed solution, which could fall under the category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
