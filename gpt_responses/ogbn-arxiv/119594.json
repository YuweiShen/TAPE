The policies proposed in the paper are based on quitting games and multi-armed bandits, which are both topics in game theory (cs.GT). The empirical testing of the policies involves evaluating their effectiveness, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of multi-armed bandits is also a common approach in reinforcement learning (cs.MA). Finally, the recursive nature of delegation and the need to choose who to delegate to can be seen as a social choice problem, which is a topic in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
