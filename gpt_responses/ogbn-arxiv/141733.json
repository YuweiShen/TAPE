The interference is created due to all pairs operating in the same frequency band, which is a characteristic of wireless networks (cs.NI). The paper also considers the problem with quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). The algorithms developed in the paper involve iterative and distributed methods, which are common in machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
