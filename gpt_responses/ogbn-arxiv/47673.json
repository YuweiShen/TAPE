The paper focuses on the separation of orbit closures via symmetries, which suggests that it could belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category deals with the study of the intrinsic complexity of computational tasks and problems, and geometric complexity theory is a subfield of computational complexity theory. Therefore, cs.CC is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.AG (Algebraic Geometry): This sub-category deals with the study of geometric objects defined by algebraic equations, and geometric complexity theory uses algebraic geometry to study the complexity of algebraic computations. Therefore, cs.AG is also a likely sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): This sub-category deals with the intersection of computer science and game theory, and geometric complexity theory has connections to game theory through the study of the complexity of computing Nash equilibria. Therefore, cs.GT is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the study of systems and control theory, and geometric control theory is a subfield of systems and control theory that uses geometric methods to study the behavior of dynamical systems.
