The paper also discusses different analog receiver architectures, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the possible configurations of the combining network, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the design of quantization architectures, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
