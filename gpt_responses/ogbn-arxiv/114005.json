The use of Gaussian channel models and noise variances also suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the concept of dependence balance is a mathematical tool that can be applied to various fields, including machine learning and optimization, which fall under the category of learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
