The proposed approach is based on deep neural networks and exploits semantic 3D structural regularity to solve the task of fine-grained pose estimation. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper also deals with active object viewpoint localization and unsupervised part-segmentation transfer, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
