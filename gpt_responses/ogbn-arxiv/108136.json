The use of interval-valued probabilities and value functions also suggests a connection to uncertainty quantification and decision analysis, which are relevant to data science (cs.DS) and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of optimization and sensitivity analysis suggests a connection to mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
