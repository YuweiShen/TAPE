This suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY), as well as robotics (cs.RO) and software engineering (cs.SE) for implementing these decisions. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of point-based solvers for approximating POMDP value functions, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) due to the potential for privacy concerns in decision-making for infrastructure systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
