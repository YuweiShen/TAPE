This topic falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) category. Additionally, PDDL is a language used in the AI community (cs.AI) for planning problems, and the paper proposes improvements to the encoding of ADL types and constraints in PDDL (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of planning algorithms for generating reconfiguration plans (cs.SY), and the use of constraints to ensure consistency in the generated plans (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
