The use of spectral methods and linear subspace models suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Signal Processing (cs.SP), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The focus on non-asymptotic error bounds and robustness to noise further supports the relevance to these sub-categories. The sub-category Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) is also a possibility, as the problem of blind deconvolution can be applied to network inference and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
