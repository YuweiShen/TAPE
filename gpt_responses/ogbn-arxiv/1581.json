The use of multiple antennas at both transmitters and receivers is a key aspect of the study, which falls under the category of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) or cs.SI (signal processing). The paper also discusses signal space partitioning schemes, which is a topic in communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper proposes a new technique called \"elevated multiplexing,\" which could be considered a sub-topic of MIMO systems and signal processing, leading to the possibility of classification under cs.MM (multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
