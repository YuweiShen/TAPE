This falls under the category of formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of prophecy variables, which are a type of program variable used in formal verification, placing it under programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also deals with equivalence reasoning, which is a topic in formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
