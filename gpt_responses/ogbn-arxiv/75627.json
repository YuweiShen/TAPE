The paper also introduces a new kind of binary linear codes, which are relevant to coding theory (cs.IT) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper's focus on communication complexity and storage overhead suggests that it may also be relevant to computer networks (cs.CC) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
