This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Programming Languages (cs.PL), and Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). However, since the paper focuses on the development of new logics, we believe that cs.LO is the most likely sub-category. The other sub-categories are also relevant because the paper discusses the application of the new logics in industrial settings, which is related to software engineering, and the lack of quantitative features, which is related to artificial intelligence and formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
