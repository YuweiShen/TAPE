This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV), as well as information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper discusses the algorithmic aspects of the approach, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
