Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. The paper also involves the comparison of the new mutation operator with existing ones, which suggests that it may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Data Mining (cs.DM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
