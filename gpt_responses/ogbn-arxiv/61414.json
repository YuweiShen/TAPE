This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Graph embedding is a technique commonly used in social and information networks analysis, and the paper focuses on improving the performance of graph analysis tasks through active learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of graph embedding for efficient graph analysis, which is relevant to information retrieval tasks such as document clustering and recommendation systems. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the use of node classification uncertainty as a criterion for selecting informative nodes, which is a common technique in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a query strategy for selecting informative nodes in a graph, which involves computing node centrality and embedding representativeness. This is relevant to the domain of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
