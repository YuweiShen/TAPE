The paper also touches upon game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in its discussion of interpreted systems. Additionally, the paper's focus on axiomatization and frame conditions suggests a connection to programming languages and formal methods (cs.PL). Finally, the paper's use of next-step temporal operators suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
