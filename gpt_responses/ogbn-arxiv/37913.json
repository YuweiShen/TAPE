It then proposes a universal measure of distance, the algorithmic information distance, which is applicable to arbitrary stimuli. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational complexity (cs.CC), or cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
