The measures studied, sensitivity, block sensitivity, and certificate complexity, are all related to the structure of the function graph, which suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also uses a recent theorem on function graphs, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper examines relations between measures for functions with small 1-sensitivity and arbitrary 0-sensitivity, which could involve computational geometry (cs.CG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
