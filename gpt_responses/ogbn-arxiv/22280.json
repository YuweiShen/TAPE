The paper also mentions the use of k-induction, which is a technique used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper involves the construction of inductive invariants, which is a topic in logic and verification (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the efficiency and effectiveness of software verification, which is a topic in formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL).
