The paper specifically focuses on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The proposed approach, spectral dropout, is a regularization method (cs.LG) that eliminates weak and noisy Fourier domain coefficients of the neural network activations. The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which is relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper demonstrates the potential of combining spectral dropout with other regularization approaches, which is relevant to the sub-category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
