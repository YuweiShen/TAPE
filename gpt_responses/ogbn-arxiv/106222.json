The use of statistics and cost estimation is also a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.DC) research. The paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) and data management (cs.DL) topics, as it involves querying and combining data from multiple sources."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
