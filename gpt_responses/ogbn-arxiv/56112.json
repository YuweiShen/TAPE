The use of partial differential equations and optimal control formulations also suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The use of spectral discretization and Fast Fourier Transform suggests a graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The use of high performance computing resources suggests a distributed, parallel, and concurrent computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization methods suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
