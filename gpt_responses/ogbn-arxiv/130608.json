The use of multiplicative and additive characters of finite fields suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and number theory (cs.NA). The efficient implementation of the sequences also suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
