The proposed solution involves detecting and restoring these backdoors in deep neural networks (cs.LG), which are commonly used in AI. The paper also mentions the use of explainable AI techniques (cs.AI) and anomaly detection methods (cs.CV) in the proposed approach. Finally, the paper discusses the need for accurate detection and restoration of trojan backdoors, which is a software engineering concern (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
