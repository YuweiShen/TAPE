Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also proposes a hardware architecture for the hybrid decoding scheme, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the simulation results and performance analysis, which could be categorized under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper proposes a low-latency decoding scheme, which could be categorized under cs.ET (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
