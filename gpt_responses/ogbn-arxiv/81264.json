This paper deals with natural language processing and information retrieval tasks, specifically the task of Open-Type Relation Argument Extraction. The paper discusses the use of neural models for this task, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the task of information retrieval (cs.IR) is relevant as the model is extracting information from a corpus. Finally, the use of a knowledge base (WikiData) also suggests the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE) may be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
