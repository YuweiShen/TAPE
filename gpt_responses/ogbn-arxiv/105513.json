The paper also discusses the decoding complexity and coding gain of the proposed STBCs, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of non-vanishing determinants (NVDs) in the design of STBCs, which is a concept in algebraic coding theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the optimality of the proposed STBCs in terms of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT), which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
