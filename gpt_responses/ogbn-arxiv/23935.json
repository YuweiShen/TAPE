This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper develops practical algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the applicability of DCS to problems in sensor arrays and networks, which could fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
