Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of pre-trained models and their impact on sample efficiency, which are topics that are often studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subfields. The paper also uses the Transformer architecture, which is a popular deep learning model for NLP tasks and is often studied in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) subfield. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which is a commonly used dataset for text summarization tasks and is often studied in the information retrieval (cs.IR) subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
