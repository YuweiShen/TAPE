Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. Additionally, it involves neural encoder-decoder models, which are commonly used in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper also involves crowdsourcing, which falls under the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category.
