Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language), as the paper also involves language-based unsupervised important sentence extraction. The paper also mentions the recent boom in AI research, indicating a possible fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques, which could fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning) and information retrieval techniques, which could fit with cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
