It also involves logic-based instantiations of argumentation frameworks, which falls under the category of computational logic (cs.LO). The paper discusses attack relations and consistency, which are topics in cryptography and security (cs.CR) and data structures (cs.DS), respectively. Finally, the paper touches on the added value of argumentation, which could be considered a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
