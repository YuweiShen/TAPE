The methodology proposed in the paper involves gate-level modifications and optimization of the circuit, which is related to digital circuits (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of transition probabilities of circuit nodes, which is related to electronic design automation (EDA) and embedded systems (cs.ET). The paper proposes a systematic methodology for designing undetectable HTs, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper involves the synthesis and characterization of designs using a 65nm technology library, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
