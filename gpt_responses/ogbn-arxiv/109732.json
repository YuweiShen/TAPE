The paper also derives an expression for the error probability of the maximum-likelihood decoder, which is a common tool in information theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the problem of reconstructing a word from noisy copies, which is a problem that can be approached using various data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses the dominant error patterns, which can be analyzed using algorithmic techniques. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with the problem of transmitting a word over multiple channels, which is a problem that can be approached using distributed, parallel, and cluster computing techniques. The paper also discusses the error probability of the maximum-likelihood decoder, which can be analyzed using parallel computing techniques. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the problem of reconstructing a word from multiple noisy copies, which is a problem that can arise in social and information networks. For example, in a social network, multiple users may share a common message that is corrupted by noise. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the problem of reconstructing a word from"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
