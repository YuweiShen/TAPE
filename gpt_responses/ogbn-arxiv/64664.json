The paper also provides sound and computationally adequate categorical models for the type system, which is a common approach in logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a new type system that supports type-level recursion and term-level recursion, which are important features in programming languages. The paper also discusses the convenience and safety properties of the type system, which are important concerns in programming languages.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper discusses a new technique for solving recursive domain equations within the category CPO, which is a common approach in natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also mentions applications of the type system in emerging programming paradigms, which may involve natural language processing or computational linguistics.\n- cs.TL (Programming Languages and Compilers): The paper proposes a new type system that supports implicit weakening and contraction rules, which are important features in programming languages and compilers. The paper also discusses the soundness and completeness of the type system, which are important concerns in compilers.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions applications of the type system in quantum programming and circuit description programming languages, which may involve machine learning or artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
