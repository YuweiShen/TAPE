Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel method for extracting constituency trees, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of pre-trained LMs in correctly demarcating adverb phrases in sentences, which could potentially fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well, since it involves identifying and segmenting specific parts of an input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
