These problems are related to coding theory and lattice problems, which are typically studied in computer science subfields such as complexity theory (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Given that the paper focuses on the computational complexity of these problems, it is likely to be classified under one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
