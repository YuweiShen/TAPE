The use of class-semantic descriptions (i.e., attributes) to provide additional semantic information about unseen concepts is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed loss function is also related to the optimization of neural networks, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on three benchmarks, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
