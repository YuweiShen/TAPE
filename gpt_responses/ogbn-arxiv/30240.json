The main focus is on computer vision (CV) tasks such as text detection and recognition, which suggests that cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of synthetic data and iterative character detection, which are common techniques in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), respectively. Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are also likely sub-categories. The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI), making them possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
