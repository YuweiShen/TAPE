Computer vision techniques are commonly used for processing data from cameras, making cs.CV the most likely category. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): Autonomous driving is a robotics application, and the paper proposes a framework for improving the stability of autonomous driving systems. Therefore, cs.RO is also a likely category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep affinity network for calculating the affinity matrix, which is a core module of sensor fusion. This involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely category. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Autonomous driving is an AI application, and the paper proposes a framework for improving the accuracy of autonomous driving systems. Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely category. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a framework for improving the stability of autonomous driving systems, which involves control systems. Therefore, cs.SY is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
