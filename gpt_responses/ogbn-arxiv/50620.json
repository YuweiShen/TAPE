The problem of finding the simplest solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations is also related to information theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a study of the existence and value of the complexity level up to which a complexity-based recovery of the input is possible. This involves analyzing algorithms and data structures for solving the problem. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The problem of finding the simplest solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations is a common problem in machine learning, where it is known as the problem of sparse recovery. The paper presents a method for solving this problem based on Kolmogorov complexity. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper investigates the difficulty of finding a matrix that has the property of recovering inputs with complexity of O(d) using MKCS. This involves analyzing the computational complexity of the problem. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The problem of finding the simplest solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations is also relevant in the field of neural and evolutionary computing, where it is known as the problem of feature selection.
