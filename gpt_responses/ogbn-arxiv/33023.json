The paper focuses on uncertainty quantification and propagation in learned dynamics models, which is a common problem in machine learning and control. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
