The algorithm is based on a greedy search strategy, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the performance guarantee of the algorithm using the restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a common technique in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
