This suggests that the paper may belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) or Databases (cs.DB) sub-categories. The proposed algorithm also uses statistical measures to quantify the association between data points, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
