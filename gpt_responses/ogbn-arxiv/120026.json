The paper also discusses coding in different settings, which is related to coding theory (cs.CC). The use of compressive sensing techniques is also mentioned, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses wiretap problems, which is related to network security (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
