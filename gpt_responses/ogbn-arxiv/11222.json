The focus on reducing computation time through approximations and exploiting domain knowledge suggests a potential fit for data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of likelihood ratios and joint probability distributions also suggests a potential fit for information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
