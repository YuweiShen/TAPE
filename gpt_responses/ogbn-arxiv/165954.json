The paper proposes a game-based approach to approximate the pointwise robustness of neural networks, which is a problem that falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and cybersecurity (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed approach in safety-critical systems, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
