This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the challenges of working in such an environment, such as occlusions and clutter, which could fall under the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also presents baseline results from several recent methods, indicating that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of blurring on the results, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
