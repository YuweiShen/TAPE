Specifically, the paper discusses the practical aspects of interpretability, such as accuracy and robustness, which are important considerations in the field of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed strategies on synthetic data and a public olfaction dataset (cs.CR), as well as on the MNIST dataset (cs.CV). Finally, the paper also discusses the relative complexity of oracle models with respect to the target model, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
