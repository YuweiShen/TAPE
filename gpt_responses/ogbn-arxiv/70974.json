This involves the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning algorithms (cs.AI, cs.LG) to create a cognitive-inspired framework for mapping. The application of this framework is in mobile robotics (cs.RO). The paper also presents a new dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which involves data processing and analysis (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
