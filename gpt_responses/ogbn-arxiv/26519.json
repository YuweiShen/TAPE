The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas and full-duplex operation, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) and cs.SY (systems and control). The paper also mentions MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology, which falls under cs.MM (multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for reducing the number of antennas, which could be relevant to cs.CE (hardware architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
