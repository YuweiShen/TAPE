The use of sample distortion functions and statistical image models suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of message passing algorithms and wavelet coefficients suggests that the paper may also be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SP (Signal Processing). Finally, the focus on practical implementation suggests that the paper may also be categorized under cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
