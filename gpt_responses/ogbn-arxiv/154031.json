It also involves analytical expressions for the expected accuracy of a K-NN, and hence a CNN, classifier for any level of noise, which is a common topic in the field of machine learning. Additionally, the paper uses real datasets to validate the analytical expression, which is a common practice in machine learning research.\n\nThe paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the study of the behavior of neural networks, which is a common topic in the field of AI. \n\nThe sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possibility as the paper deals with neural networks and their resistance to label noise. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) may also be relevant as the paper involves the study of the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier and its behavior in the presence of label noise."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
