This involves adapting the transmission probability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and unlicensed bands to achieve proportional fair coexistence of WiFi, small cell, and macro cell users. The paper uses mathematical optimization techniques and proposes a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on both bands. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), as the paper also deals with the efficient utilization of radio resources and the tradeoff between maximizing network throughput and achieving fairness among network flows."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
