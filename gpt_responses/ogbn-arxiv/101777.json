The proposed method uses deep learning-based reflectance map prediction system for material estimation, which is a popular topic in computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of synthetic data to solve the lack of data problem is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed network architecture for Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameter estimation and environment map estimation involves the use of neural networks, which is a popular topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of reflectance maps and material estimation is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications such as image and video editing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
