The paper specifically focuses on using training wheels to facilitate learning in hardware, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The concept of shaping the reward landscape is also relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses visual feedback to map out the reward landscape, which involves computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
