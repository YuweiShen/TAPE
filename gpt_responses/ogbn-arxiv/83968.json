The use of transformers and PropBank labels suggests a focus on deep learning and semantic analysis, which are common in the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation on image captioning datasets (MSCOCO and WikiAnswers) also suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV), while the use of multi-encoders suggests a potential application in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
