The authors also conduct simulation experiments to compare different friction models, which is a common practice in robotics research. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions a \"data-driven footprint of friction\" and discusses biases in the collected dataset, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although not the main focus of the paper, the authors mention using a camera to collect data during the pushing experiments. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the control of frictional forces in manipulating objects, which is a topic within systems and control. \n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper discusses the mechanics of friction and its role in manipulating objects, which is a topic within mechanical engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
