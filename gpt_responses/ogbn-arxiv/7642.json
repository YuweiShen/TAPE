Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new regularization scheme and uses deep learning techniques, which are common in sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of LSTM layers, which are commonly used in sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
