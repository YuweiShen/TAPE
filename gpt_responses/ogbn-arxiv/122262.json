This approach is evaluated on three datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also introduces a new convolutional operation and a hierarchical structure for feature aggregation, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with semantic segmentation, which is a task related to natural language processing and understanding. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
