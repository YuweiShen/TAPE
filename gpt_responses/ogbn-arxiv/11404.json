This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new learning framework for CNNs, which involves reparameterizing the inner product and generalizing it to the decoupled convolution operator. This falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also presents several effective instances of the decoupled convolution operator, which falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
