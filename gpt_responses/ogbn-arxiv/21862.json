Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary focus of the paper. The sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also likely, as the paper deals with neural networks. The sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory) is relevant as the paper discusses the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices. The sub-category cs.SI (Systems and Control) is relevant as the paper discusses the many knobs of the training process and how they affect the implicit Self-Regularization. Finally, the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control) is relevant as the paper discusses the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
