The authors propose using graph neural networks (GNN) to learn policies for botnet detection automatically, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the synthesis of botnet connections and communication patterns, which relates to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
