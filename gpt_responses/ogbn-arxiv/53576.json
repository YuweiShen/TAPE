This topic is highly relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) since the proposed approach aims to improve the classification performance of deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, the paper involves the use of probability theory and evidence theory, which are relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of multiple objectives, which is relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
