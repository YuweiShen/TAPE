Additionally, it may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) due to the use of machine learning techniques for summarization and the focus on evaluating the effectiveness of summarization systems. The paper also mentions inter-annotator agreement, which suggests a focus on machine learning evaluation metrics, making it likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
