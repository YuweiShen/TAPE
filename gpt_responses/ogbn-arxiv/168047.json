This aligns with the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the design and implementation of a coexistence mechanism for two different types of traffic in a wireless network, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper formulates an optimization problem to maximize the MEAR of eMBB UEs while fulfilling the provisions of the uRLLC traffic, which involves information theory concepts such as channel coding and modulation.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a scheduling algorithm to allocate radio resources among eMBB and uRLLC UEs, which can be viewed as a control problem in a system with multiple inputs and outputs.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper considers eMBB traffic, which typically involves multimedia applications such as video streaming and gaming, and aims to maximize the data rates for such traffic.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but these aspects may be relevant in the context of wireless network security and privacy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
