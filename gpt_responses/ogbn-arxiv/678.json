It also combines insights from 3D geometric computer vision with recent advances in learning image-to-image mappings based on adversarial loss functions. \n\nIt could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with 3D scene representation and view synthesis. \n\nThe paper also involves learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a learned representation that encodes the view-dependent appearance of a 3D scene without explicitly modeling its geometry. \n\nAdditionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses deep learning techniques to learn the persistent 3D feature embeddings. \n\nFinally, it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it uses neural networks to learn the representation and enforce perspective and multi-view geometry in a principled manner."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
