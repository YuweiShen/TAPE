This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper proposes a flexible convex relaxation for the phase retrieval problem that operates in the natural domain of the signal, and uses statistical learning theory to analyze the performance of the proposed estimator. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NA, and cs.SI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
