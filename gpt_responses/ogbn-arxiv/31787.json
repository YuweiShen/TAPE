Specifically, the paper focuses on L1-regularized approximate linear programming (RALP) and introduces a new method called Locally Smoothed L1-Regularized Approximate Linear Programming (LS-RALP) to mitigate inaccuracies stemming from noise. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
