The models proposed are inspired by social networks, which could also place it in the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper analyzes various properties of the sequential versions of the model, which could suggest it belongs to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category.
