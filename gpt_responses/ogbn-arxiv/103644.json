The use of atomic norm methods for this problem has been gaining attention due to their superior accuracy, flexibility, and robustness. The paper analyzes the sample complexity of atomic norm minimization for multichannel frequency estimation from noiseless compressive data. This problem falls under the intersection of several CS sub-categories, including information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and possibly social and information networks (cs.SI) if the multichannel data is interpreted as a network. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.SI, cs.SP, cs.LG, and cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
