The proposed approach involves a representation theoretic approach to studying problems of alignment over compact groups, which is related to machine learning (LG) and optimization (DS, NA). The paper also mentions the use of semidefinite programs (SDPs), which is a topic in control systems (SY). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.DS, cs.NA, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
