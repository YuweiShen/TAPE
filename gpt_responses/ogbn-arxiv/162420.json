Additionally, the paper involves geometric reasoning (GR) to align the CAD models to the scans. The use of a differentiable Procrustes alignment and a fully-convolutional approach suggests the involvement of robotics (RO) and machine learning (LG) techniques. Finally, the end-to-end nature of the approach suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
