This involves the use of information theory concepts to optimize the transmission of data over the network.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the challenges faced by the next generation of wireless networks and proposes a framework for addressing these challenges. This involves the use of networking and internet architecture concepts to design a flexible and dynamic infrastructure.\n\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the use of GFDM as a baseline for flexible circular filtered multicarrier systems, which is a communication and networking concept. The paper also discusses the use of software-defined network principles to produce software-defined waveforms.\n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of a block-oriented concept to provide the modulation service, which is a systems and control concept. The paper also discusses the use of synchronization and advanced receiver design, which are systems and control concepts.\n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the requirements of future mobile networks, which may include multimedia applications such as video streaming and virtual reality. The paper also discusses the use of different flavors of waveforms designed to go beyond the well-established Orthogonal Frequency Division Multip"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
