The paper proposes a decentralized approach for computing the viability kernel for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Control Systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves the use of numerical techniques and computations, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of Robotics (cs.RO) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of isomorphisms, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
