The method presented involves using onboard visual-inertial sensors and computer to estimate the state and generate a trajectory, which involves computer vision (cs.CV), control systems (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of replanning during execution, which involves machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
