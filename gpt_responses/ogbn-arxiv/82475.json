This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of word2vec Skip-Gram model, which is a popular method in natural language processing (NLP) and falls under the sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of neural-based explicit representations, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Deep Learning (cs.DL) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IR, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
