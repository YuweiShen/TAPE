The paper focuses on combining the stability and performance of iterative sampling policies with the low computational cost of a policy network. This involves training a Q-function using iterative sampling with the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), while training a policy network to imitate CEM's sampling behavior. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
