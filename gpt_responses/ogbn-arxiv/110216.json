This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. The proposed algorithm is based on exploiting the inherent structures of the frozen-bit locations in a polar-encoded block of data, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper is tailored to the 5G standardization effort discussions, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Communications (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
