The paper proposes a new evaluation procedure for extractive summarization that focuses on facets (i.e., topics or themes) rather than individual words or phrases. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which are the two most relevant sub-categories for NLP research. Additionally, the paper involves manual annotation of support sentences, which suggests a focus on human-in-the-loop or annotation-based approaches, which are common in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art summarization methods, which suggests a focus on empirical research and experimentation, which is common in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL, cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.NE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
