The use of kernelization also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also addresses the limitations of VLAD, which is a popular approach in visual recognition tasks, indicating that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The mention of tensors suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of approximate formulations for acceleration suggests that it may belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
