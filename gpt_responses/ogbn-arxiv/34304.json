The paper focuses on system-level tracing techniques and statistical analysis to detect compromised devices, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and system and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of signal processing techniques, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper proposes a configurable framework that uses statistical analysis, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance analysis of the proposed framework, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
