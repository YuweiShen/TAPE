The use of reinforcement learning also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the model to autonomous driving systems suggests that it could also be categorized under robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which suggests that it could also be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
