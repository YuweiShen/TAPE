The images are forensic in nature, which suggests a potential connection to computer security (cs.CR). The use of deep feature representation and domain-related data also suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the evaluation of the clustering results suggests a potential connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
