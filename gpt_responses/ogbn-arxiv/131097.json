The paper also presents an online game for user experiments, which involves human-robot interaction studies (cs.HC). The game involves statistical analysis of user behavior, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the results in automatic controllers, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper presents a template for large online robotic research experiments, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
