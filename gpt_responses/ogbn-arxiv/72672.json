Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages), which is the main category for research on programming languages. The paper also discusses the core properties of functional logic programming, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper proposes an implementation that exploits advanced features of functional logic languages, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper mentions the non-deterministic nature of functional logic programming, which could also suggest cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
