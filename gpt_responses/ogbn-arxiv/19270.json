The architecture uses a self-organizing neural controller to bootstrap sensorimotor exploration and learn modular structures that predict the sensorimotor dynamics and generate associated behavior. The paper also discusses the use of unexpected prediction error signals to detect transitions between successive behavioral primitives. Given the focus on machine learning, robotics, and neural networks, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
