The paper also introduces a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, which is a common technique used in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The algorithm is based on state-space sampling, which is a technique used in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithm in terms of regret, which is a common metric in optimization (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with decision-making in a stochastic environment, which is a topic that falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
