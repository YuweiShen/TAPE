The specific problems studied in the paper, such as the submodular secretary problem and submodular matching, are also related to game theory (cs.GT) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also considers linear constraints, which falls under the subfield of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
