Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the use of millimeter-wave communications and the 60 GHz band, which are topics related to information theory and signal processing, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the properties of the proposed algorithm, such as scalability and time efficiency, which are related to computer systems and performance evaluation, making cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) possible categories. Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques and algorithms, which are related to distributed computing and optimization, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
