This involves modeling reactions as hyperlinks connecting multiple vertices (metabolites). The algorithm uses matrix completion and matching optimization to jointly infer in the incidence space and adjacency space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel algorithm for hyperlink prediction, which involves matrix completion and matching optimization. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with predicting hyperlinks in metabolic networks, which can be seen as a type of information network. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Social and Information Networks sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel algorithm for predicting missing reactions in metabolic networks, which involves modeling reactions as hyperlinks and using matrix completion and matching optimization. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with predicting missing reactions in metabolic networks, which involves modeling reactions as hyperlinks and using matrix completion and matching optimization.
