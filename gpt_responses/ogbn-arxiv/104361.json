The use of regularization techniques and the incorporation of information theory suggest a focus on optimization and control (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the experiments conducted on the AI2-THOR framework and the Active Vision Dataset (AVD) suggest a focus on robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
