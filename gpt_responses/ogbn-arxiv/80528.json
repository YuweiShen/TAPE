This involves topics related to artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics (RO) in terms of solving complex path finding problems. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of propositional logic (PL) and data structures (DS) in the development of the solver. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for the solver to be used in continuous MAPF with geometric agents, which falls under the category of logic (LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
