Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of higher order potentials and optimisation algorithms, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of quadratic programming and linear programming relaxations indicates that it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
