This involves the use of information theory concepts such as extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper focuses on improving the error rate performance of LTE systems, which is a communication and networking technology. The proposed codes are designed to work with the hybrid automatic repeat request protocol and the Turbo decoder for each code block.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes a new coding scheme for LTE systems, which is a type of wireless networking technology. The proposed codes aim to improve the error rate performance of the system.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new decoding scheme for the proposed information-coupled Turbo codes. This involves the use of feed-forward and feed-back decoding schemes and a windowed decoding scheme, which are related to systems and control.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the construction of extrinsic information transfer functions for the LTE Turbo codes and the proposed information-coupled Turbo codes. This involves the use of algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
