This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including software engineering (cs.SE), systems and control (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also uses heuristic solving schemes, which are commonly used in optimization and search algorithms, further supporting the relevance to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
