This falls under the area of programming languages (cs.PL) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also deals with the specification and verification of correctness conditions for concurrent objects, which is related to logic in computer science (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper includes case studies of concurrent objects, which can be considered as data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
