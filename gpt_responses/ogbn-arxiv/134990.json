This makes it likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of B\\\"\"uchi automata to capture finite and infinite traces, which could also place it in the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) category. The paper also deals with liveness properties, which could make it relevant to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) category. The use of abstraction and abstract interpretation could also make it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category. Finally, the paper's focus on automata and formal languages could make it relevant to the Language and Automata Theory (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
