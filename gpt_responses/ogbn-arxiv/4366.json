Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper proposes a new method that improves the reliability of out-of-distribution image detection, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (AI) and computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed method involves adding small perturbations to the input, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
