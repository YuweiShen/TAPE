The main focus of the paper is on the use of integrated access backhauling (IAB) for 5G networks, which involves the use of wireless spectrum for backhaul connections (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the cost implications of fiber deployment, which is related to information theory and optimization (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of high-frequency deployments, which is related to millimeter wave technology (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the 3GPP standardization process, which is related to architecture and networking (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
