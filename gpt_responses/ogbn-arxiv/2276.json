This involves addressing two key issues: constructing a robust representation that captures the spatial-temporal evolutions of motions from skeleton sequences, and designing D-CNNs capable of learning discriminative features from the new representation in an effective manner. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on two challenging datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) are also possible sub-categories given the focus on video analysis and action recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
