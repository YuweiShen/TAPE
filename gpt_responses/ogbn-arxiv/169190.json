Thus, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves wireless communication and network protocols, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The proposed model uses edge cloud technology, which can be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also employs a heuristic-based approach for authentication, which can be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
