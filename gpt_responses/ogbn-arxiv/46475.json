The specific application domains mentioned in the abstract (power systems and neuronal networks) suggest that the paper may also fall under the subcategories of signal processing (cs.SI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the use of submodular optimization techniques is a common tool in discrete mathematics (cs.DM), which further supports the inclusion of this subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
