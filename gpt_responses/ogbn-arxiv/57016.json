The method involves retraining the network after relaxing random partitions of the weights to their continuous values, which involves optimization techniques (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the performance of the method on various neural network architectures, which is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the method can be integrated into existing frameworks, which relates to systems and control research (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
