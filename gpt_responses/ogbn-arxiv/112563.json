This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves measuring communication in terms of the total number of bits exchanged. The paper also proposes algorithms for splitting the source sequence into substrings and synchronizing them, which involves data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper mentions the use of channel codes (cs.SI) and provides theoretical performance bounds and simulation results (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
