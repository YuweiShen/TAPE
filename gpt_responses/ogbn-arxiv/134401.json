The proposed approach involves using a continuous temporal embedding of framewise features to identify clusters of temporal segments across all videos that correspond to semantic meaningful action classes. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the approach involves unsupervised learning, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the approach on three challenging datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the task of identifying semantic meaningful action classes, which suggests that it may also belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
