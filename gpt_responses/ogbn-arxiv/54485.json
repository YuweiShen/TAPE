The use of linear codes and subspace codes also suggests a connection to network security (cs.NI) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The introduction of access structure and the characterization of security by minimal codewords may also relate to information security (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
