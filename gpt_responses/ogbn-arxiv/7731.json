This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as the goal is to extract text information from images. The paper also mentions the use of characteristic features of text and graphics, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency and memory consumption of the developed technique, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
