It also involves the use of external knowledge to refine object and phrase features, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper proposes a novel algorithm, which involves regularization techniques, indicating that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing tasks such as phrase features, which could place it under the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category. Finally, the paper deals with visual datasets, which could also place it under the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
