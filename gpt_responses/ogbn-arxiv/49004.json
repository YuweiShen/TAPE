This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of hand-crafted features and the evaluation on a medical imaging dataset suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the use of multimodal MRI images may also make this paper relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
