The paper proposes a new approach for dialogue state tracking that can generalize well over multiple domains without incorporating any domain-specific knowledge, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach involves learning discrete dialogue state variables independently, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained word embeddings, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.SD). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework using a widely used dialogue state tracking challenge data set, which is a common practice in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
