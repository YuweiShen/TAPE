This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also focuses on off-loading low-level control from the end-user, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The algorithm used for object detection and orientation computation involves machine learning techniques, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
