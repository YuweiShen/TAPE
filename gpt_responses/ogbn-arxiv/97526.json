This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), digital libraries (cs.DL), machine learning (cs.LG), and cybernetics (cs.CY). The use of similarity metrics and corpus analysis techniques are common in these sub-fields, and the study of scientific abstracts is relevant to researchers working on natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
