This involves formulating the scheduling problem as a Minimum Cost Maximum Flow problem and leveraging queue waiting time and electricity price predictions to estimate the cost of job execution accurately. The paper also uses trace-based simulation with real and synthetic workload traces and real electricity price data sets to demonstrate the approach on two currently operational grids, XSEDE and NorduGrid. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). The paper also deals with scheduling algorithms, which could place it in cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
