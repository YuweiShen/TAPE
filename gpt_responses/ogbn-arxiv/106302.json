Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of support-vector-machines (SVM) and deep neural networks, which are common in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with video quality and camera viewpoints, which are relevant to the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves the use of hand-crafted features, which are relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
