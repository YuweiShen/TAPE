The paper proposes a new architecture for object detection, which involves training a multi-scale CNN using a multi-task loss. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper explores feature upsampling using deconvolution, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper applies its proposed method to datasets containing small objects, which suggests that it could also be categorized under robotics (cs.RO), as small object detection is important for many robotic applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
