This involves trading off accuracy against practical usefulness. The paper also presents a new local way of computing the description length, which improves the search algorithm and allows for local refinement of an existing network. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), social and information networks (cs.SI), data management (cs.DM), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
