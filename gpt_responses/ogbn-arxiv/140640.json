The paper also explores the behavior of LZ'78 on finite words, which involves data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper uses mathematical techniques to prove its results, which is a characteristic of papers in machine learning (cs.LG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
