The paper proposes a hardware technique for handling outliers in fixed-point quantization of neural networks, which is relevant to the fields of computer architecture (cs.AR) and embedded systems (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the impact of outlier handling on the accuracy of neural networks, which is relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes a hardware technique for improving the performance of neural network accelerators, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
