This involves optimizing indexing structures for similarity search, which is a core topic in data structures and algorithms. \n\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper discusses the problem of similarity search in specialized database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features. This is a core topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. \n\n3. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper discusses the problem of similarity search in specialized database systems, which require specific indexing structures. This is a core topic in databases. \n\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes optimized designs for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. These are techniques commonly used in machine learning for similarity search. \n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the problem of similarity search in specialized database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features. This is a core topic in multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
