The specific focus on natural graphs and the use of power-law distribution suggests a connection to Network Science (cs.SI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of streaming algorithms and online partitioning suggests a connection to Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines suggests a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
