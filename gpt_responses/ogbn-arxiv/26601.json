It also involves the use of preference relations and consistency conditions, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The concept of self-stability is related to stability and equilibrium, which are studied in both computer science (cs.DS) and social choice theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper proposes a new class of social choice functions, which could be of interest to researchers in social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
