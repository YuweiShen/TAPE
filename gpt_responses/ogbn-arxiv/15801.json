This falls under the scope of AI research.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper heavily relies on social media streams as a source of probabilistic data for event detection. This falls under the scope of research on social and information networks.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of machine learning models to automatically update and fine-tune for event recognition. This falls under the scope of research on information retrieval.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper presents a framework for event recognition that involves integrating multiple sources of data and automating machine learning model updates. This falls under the scope of research on software engineering.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of machine learning models for event recognition, which involves processing and analyzing large amounts of data. This falls under the scope of research on data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
