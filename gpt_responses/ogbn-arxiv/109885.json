The use of amplify-and-forward two-way relay networks suggests a focus on communication protocols and systems (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses modulation schemes, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of Cramer-Rao bounds suggests a focus on statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
