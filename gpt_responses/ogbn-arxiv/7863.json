This makes it highly relevant to the field of cryptography and security. \n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the implementation of the attack in JavaScript, which is a programming language commonly used in web development. This makes it relevant to the field of software engineering. \n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the implementation of the attack in JavaScript, which is a programming language commonly used in web development. This makes it relevant to the field of programming languages. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the ability of the attack to recover information belonging to other processes, other users, and even other virtual machines running on the same physical host as the victim web browser. This makes it relevant to the field of distributed computing. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the ability of the attack to recover information belonging to other processes, other users, and even other virtual machines running on the same physical host as the victim web browser.
