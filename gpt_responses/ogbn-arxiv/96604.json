Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also presents results on higher-dimensional range reporting, which is a topic of interest in both cs.CG and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper discusses the space and time complexity of the proposed data structures, which are important considerations in database systems and artificial intelligence applications, respectively. Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
