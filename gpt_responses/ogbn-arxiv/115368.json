It also involves multiple users and network modulation, which suggests that it could also belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The use of space-time coding and the extension to other communication networks with MIMO links suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
