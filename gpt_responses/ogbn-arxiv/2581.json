The paper proposes a locally-biased eigen-problem to find local polarized communities in signed graphs, which involves spectral graph theory and optimization. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
