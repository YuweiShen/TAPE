The proposed model involves joint estimation of task relationship structure and individual task parameters, which is solved using alternating minimization. The task relationship structure learning component builds on recent advances in structure learning of Gaussian graphical models based on sparse estimators of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.ST (Statistics)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
