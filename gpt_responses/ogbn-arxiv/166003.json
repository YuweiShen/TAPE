It could also fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category as CDNs may need to consider security implications when customizing IW configurations. Additionally, it could be classified under Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) as CDNs are distributed systems. The paper also touches on system-level issues (cs.SY) such as network-dependent configurations and the impact on CDN performance. Finally, it could be classified under Performance (cs.PF) as the paper discusses how CDNs optimize web performance through TCP congestion control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
