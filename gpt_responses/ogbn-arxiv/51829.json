Game theory is a natural framework to analyze such settings. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper aims to protect users' privacy while achieving better welfare and revenue. This suggests that some cryptographic techniques may be involved. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms to approximate the optimal revenue or welfare. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, ad auctions often involve machine learning techniques to predict user behavior and optimize bids. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a signaling scheme, which involves transmitting information between parties. Information theory may provide useful tools to analyze the efficiency and privacy of the scheme."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
