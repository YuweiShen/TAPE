The paper uses fine-grained complexity theory to prove lower bounds on the running time of exact and approximate algorithms for EMD. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
