This involves designing CSs that are compatible with the framework of IEEE P802.11ba and exploiting a recursive Golay complementary pair (GCP) construction to reduce instantaneous power fluctuations. This aspect of the paper is related to information theory and signal processing.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wake-up radio signals in IEEE P802.11ba, which is a standard for low-power and low-latency wireless communication. Wake-up radio signals are used to activate devices that are in sleep mode, which can help save energy and extend battery life. This aspect of the paper is related to networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a transmission scheme based on complementary sequences (CSs) to reduce the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of wake-up signals (WUSs) in IEEE P802.11ba.
