This topic falls under the scope of social network analysis, which is covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is the most likely category as it specifically deals with social networks. cs.SD (Software Engineering) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely categories as the paper discusses computational methods for analysing signed networks. cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) are less likely categories, but are still possible as the paper also discusses financial portfolio networks and molecular graphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
