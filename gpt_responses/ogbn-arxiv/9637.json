The paper proposes a new definition of Extended Integrated Interleaved (EII) codes that can be defined over any field, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses improvements over previous constructions of LRC codes, which is a topic related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper presents an iterative decoding algorithm, which is a topic related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses applications of EII codes, such as finding a systematic encoding and ordering the symbols, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
