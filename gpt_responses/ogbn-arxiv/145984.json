Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of preordering and compound splitting, which are techniques commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), making cs.AI the second likely sub-category. The paper also involves training and testing of SMT models, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (ML) and specifically, Large Scale Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of suffix separation, which is a technique used in Information Retrieval (IR) for stemming, making cs.IR a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of high-performance computing resources, which falls under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
