It also involves natural language processing tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, which fall under the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves pruning visually-irrelevant relationships, which can be seen as a form of feature selection or dimensionality reduction, and thus may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
