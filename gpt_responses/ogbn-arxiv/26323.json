This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as well as data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). The proposed solution involves the use of sparse graph codes, which is a topic in both information theory and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of probability and computational complexity, which is related to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
