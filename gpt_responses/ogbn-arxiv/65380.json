The use of distributed optical amplification (OA) is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the sub-category of optical networking (cs.OH). The paper also discusses the impact of thermal noise on the capacity of the receiver, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper deals with the issue of spectral broadening, which is a topic related to photonics (cs.PH) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
