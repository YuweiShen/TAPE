This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Deep Learning (cs.DL). Among these, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely categories since the paper deals with analyzing textual data in patent documents. However, since the proposed model is based on deep learning, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.DL are also likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
