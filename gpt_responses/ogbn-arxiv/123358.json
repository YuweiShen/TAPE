The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) also suggests that it may fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. The comparison of human and DNN generalisation abilities suggests that it may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of behavioural consequences and the need for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain suggests that it may also fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
