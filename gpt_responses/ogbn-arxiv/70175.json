The paper also mentions the use of computational graphs, which is a common tool in artificial intelligence research, making cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper focuses on image classifiers and language models, which are common applications of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), respectively. Finally, the paper mentions hyperparameter optimization, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
