The proposed approach involves the use of Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques, which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). The paper also deals with the issue of user-POI matrix sparsity, which is a common problem in Recommender Systems (RS) and Database (DB) research. Finally, the paper proposes a combined matrix factorization framework, which is a popular technique in both ML and Social Network Analysis (SNA). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IR, cs.LG, cs.SI, cs.DB, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
