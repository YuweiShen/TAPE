Therefore, it is highly likely that this paper belongs to the cs.CL sub-category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper utilizes 3D CNN architectures for video extraction, which is a common technique used in computer vision. Therefore, it is likely that this paper also belongs to the cs.CV sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper utilizes sequence modelling techniques such as LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers, which are commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, it is likely that this paper also belongs to the cs.LG sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper deals with the development of an AI model for video captioning and summarization, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is likely that this paper also belongs to the cs.AI sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with video captioning and summarization, which is a multimedia task.
