This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The system also involves local search and evaluation of strategies, which could be considered under the sub-categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of the system in various theorem proving systems, which could be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper involves the use of data to evolve the notion of \"similar easy problems\", which could be considered under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
