The paper also proposes improvements to existing methods, which involves optimizing loss functions and sampling methods, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark, which is a popular computer vision benchmark, and is likely to be submitted to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
