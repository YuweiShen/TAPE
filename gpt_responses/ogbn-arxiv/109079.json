The paper focuses on gluing feature learning and data association into a unity by a bi-level optimization formulation so that the association results can be directly learned from features. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of hierarchical association, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the necessary alignment and selection of raw detection responses, which suggests that it may belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper is about multiple object tracking, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
