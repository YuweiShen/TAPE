The paper proposes a novel approach for automatic task selection and mixing in MTL, which involves Bayesian optimization and Thompson Sampling. These techniques are commonly used in the sub-fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which suggests that cs.LG and cs.AI are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the experiments are conducted on the GLUE benchmark, which is a popular benchmark for NLP tasks, indicating that cs.CL is also a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions using pre-trained language models, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks, suggesting that cs.CV is a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper uses Gaussian processes, which are commonly used in neural networks, suggesting that cs.NE is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
