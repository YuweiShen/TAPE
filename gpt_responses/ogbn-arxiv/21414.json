The paper presents a procedure for eliminating negations from formulas in HFL, which is a common technique in logic and computer science. The paper also discusses the size of the resulting formulas after negation elimination, which is a complexity measure that is often used in computer science. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.LF (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
