The paper specifically addresses the problem of BO under partially right-censored response data, which is a statistical problem. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem of algorithm configuration is also mentioned, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
