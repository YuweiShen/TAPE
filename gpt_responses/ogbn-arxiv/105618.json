The use of high dimensional expanders suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also introduces a new random walk on simplicial complexes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and combinatorics (cs.DS). Information theory (cs.IT) may be relevant due to the use of agreement testing, which involves testing the similarity of two objects. Machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant due to the use of expanders, which have been used in the analysis of neural networks. Finally, the paper may fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) due to the use of agreement testing and the analysis of random walks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
