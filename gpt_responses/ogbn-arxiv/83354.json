This involves using object detectors as output models for the states of a hidden Markov model (HMM) to model the sequence of poses of the event participants over time. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel training method that uses an EM loop to simultaneously learn the temporal structure and object models automatically, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of a new dataset, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it aims to detect events in videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
