Therefore, cs.DB (Database) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses user-defined functions and stored procedures, which are related to programming languages, hence cs.PL (Programming Languages) is also likely. The paper proposes heuristics for optimization, which is related to software engineering, hence cs.SE (Software Engineering) is also a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of iterative execution and batch processing, which are related to artificial intelligence and data structures, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
