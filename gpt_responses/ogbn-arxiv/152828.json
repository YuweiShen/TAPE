The use of keypoints and motion prediction networks also suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper's emphasis on synthesizing output frames using appearance information extracted from input images suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
