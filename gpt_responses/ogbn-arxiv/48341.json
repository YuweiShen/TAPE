This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper also employs a decoder based on recurrent neural networks to generate captions of Chinese characters by detecting radicals and structures through a spatial attention mechanism. This involves natural language processing techniques and hence can be categorized under cs.CL.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed RAN uses convolutional neural networks as an encoder and recurrent neural networks as a decoder, both of which are machine learning techniques. Hence, this paper can also be categorized under cs.LG.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for zero-shot learning in printed Chinese character recognition, which involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques to recognize unseen Chinese character classes.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Although not the primary focus of the paper, the proposed RAN can also be used for information retrieval tasks such as searching for Chinese characters based on their radicals and structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
