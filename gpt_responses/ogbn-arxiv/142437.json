It also involves the use of input probability distributions, which is a common concept in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) as it deals with the processing of signals in a communication channel. The use of Kuhn-Tucker conditions and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the transmission of multiple signals over a communication channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
