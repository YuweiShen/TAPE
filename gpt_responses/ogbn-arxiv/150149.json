Therefore, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses established polynomial-time algorithms to solve the Max-Cut problem on planar graphs, which suggests that cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) could also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
