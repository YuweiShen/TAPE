The problem ETR-INV is a decision problem about the existence of a real number satisfying a certain property, which can be formulated as a quantified Boolean formula (QBF). This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), computational geometry (cs.CG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
