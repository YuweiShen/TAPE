The paper proposes an algorithmic approach to accelerate the process of generating pairwise comparison labels. This problem is closely related to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), and statistics (cs.ST). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
