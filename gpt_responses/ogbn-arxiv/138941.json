The protocol is designed for resource-constrained devices, which suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). The paper also addresses security vulnerabilities and provides a fix, indicating a focus on computer engineering (cs.CE) and network security (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
