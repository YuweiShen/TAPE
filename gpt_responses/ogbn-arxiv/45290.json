The paper also discusses the encoding and decoding complexity of the polar codes, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The discussion of the uniform rate regions of the extremal MACs suggests a connection to network information theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the application of the polar code construction to channels with a finite field input alphabet, which is a topic in network coding (cs.NI). Finally, the paper's focus on the construction of codes for a specific type of channel suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
