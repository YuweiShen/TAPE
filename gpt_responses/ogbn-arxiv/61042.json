The use of beeps as a communication mechanism falls under the category of network protocols and algorithms (cs.NI). The paper also involves analyzing the behavior of nodes in the network, which is a common theme in distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of synchronized clocks and the comparison to Luby's MIS algorithm suggest a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
