The approach involves using bag-of-words as targets in the training stage, which is related to machine learning (cs.AI), as well as using multiple correct translations to encourage the model to generate potentially correct sentences, which involves optimization and model selection (cs.LG). The bag-of-words approach also involves identifying similarities between correct translations, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of bag-of-words as targets is also related to information retrieval (cs.IR), as it involves identifying relevant words and phrases in a sentence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
