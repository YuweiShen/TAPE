This involves image processing and machine learning, which are core topics in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions real-time operation and optimal output, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of bounding boxes for localisation indicates a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
