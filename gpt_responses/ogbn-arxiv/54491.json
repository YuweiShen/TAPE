The concept of channel polarization is also central to the paper, which is a technique used in coding theory and communication systems (cs.CC). The paper also involves analyzing the evolution of a function under transformations, which is a common theme in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper's focus on extremality and optimization also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
