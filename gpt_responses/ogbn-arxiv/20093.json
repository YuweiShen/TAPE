This involves addressing challenges related to software complexity, maintenance, and user-friendliness, which are key concerns in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the use of efficient client-server architecture, socket-based protocol, and parameter mapping mechanisms, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and software design (cs.SD). Finally, the paper presents a proof-of-concept evaluation, which involves implementing and testing the middleware, which is relevant to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
