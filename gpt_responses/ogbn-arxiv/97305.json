Hence, cs.LG is a likely category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with social or information networks, the proposed method could potentially be applied to improve speech recognition in multilingual social or information networks, where code-switching is common. Hence, cs.SI is a possible category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with end-to-end code-switching automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which is a sub-area of NLP, and hence, cs.CL is a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
