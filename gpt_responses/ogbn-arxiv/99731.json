This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper considers design criteria for minimizing multiuser interference in the downlink communication, which involves control and optimization of the system.\n3. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a communication system that involves multiple antennas and cellular users, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Similar to the previous point, the paper deals with a communication system that involves cellular users, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a system that involves both radar and communication, which can be considered as a form of multimedia. However, this is less likely compared to the other categories mentioned above."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
