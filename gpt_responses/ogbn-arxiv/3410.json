The use of provenance views to hide data is a technique commonly used in security and privacy research (cs.CR). The paper also discusses optimization problems related to minimizing the amount of hidden data, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a model for propagating data hiding through public modules, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
