The paper proposes a centralized coin-mixing algorithm based on an elliptic curve blind signature scheme. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different blind signature-based algorithms. The paper also discusses the speed of the proposed algorithm compared to other algorithms. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
