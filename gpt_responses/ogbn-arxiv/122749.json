The proposed method involves using a preliminary filtering stage based on saliency detection, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of keypoint detectors and local descriptors, which are techniques commonly used in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
