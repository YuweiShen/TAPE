The paper also uses an antenna-theory-based channel model to analyze the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base station, which is a common approach in information theory.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of full-duplex wireless communication systems, which is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture. The paper also analyzes the spatial resources of the channel, which is relevant to the design of wireless networks.\n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the performance of full-duplex wireless communication systems, which are commonly used for multimedia applications. The paper also analyzes the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base station, which is relevant to the design of multimedia systems.\n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of full-duplex wireless communication systems, which can be viewed as a control problem. The paper also analyzes the spatial resources of the channel, which is relevant to the design of control systems.\n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the challenge of managing self-interference in full-duplex wireless communication, which is relevant to the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
