It also involves analyzing the difference between the sets of features that adversarially robust and standard accurate models depend on, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of models to attacks (cs.CR) and the use of pre-trained models (cs.NE) in low resolution datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
