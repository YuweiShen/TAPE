Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of regularisation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses Rademacher complexity analysis, which is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
