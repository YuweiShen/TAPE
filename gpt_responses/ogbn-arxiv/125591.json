The use of channel conditions and the comparison of adversarial channels suggest that the paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the examination of a binary adversarial channel suggests that the paper may touch on multimedia (cs.MM) if the channel is used for multimedia transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
