The proposed approach is implemented using the Transformer model, which is commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and language modeling (cs.CL). The paper also discusses experiments on image captioning (cs.CV) and code generation (cs.SE), which are both related to sequence generation tasks. The approach involves adaptive generation orders obtained from beam-search, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, these categories are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
