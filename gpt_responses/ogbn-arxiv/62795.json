This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and game theory (cs.GT). The use of Markov chains to model the fading process of each user suggests a connection to stochastic processes and control (cs.SY), while the consideration of a successive interference decoder indicates a possible link to networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the use of game-theoretic concepts to analyze the behavior of selfish users in a shared communication channel suggests a connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
