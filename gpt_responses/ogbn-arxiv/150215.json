The use of compression codes and the focus on video frames suggest that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of nonlocal structures and the focus on image recovery suggest that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of iterative algorithms and convergence guarantees suggest that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
