The paper also mentions the use of inner product calculations, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The scalability and potential for deployment in embedded environments suggest a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the use of stochastic separation theorems suggests a focus on neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
