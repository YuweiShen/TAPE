The use of classification techniques such as Lazy Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, Multiclass, and Naive Bayes classifiers suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) in the research. The creation of a database from different public and open access sources for years 1970-2015 indicates the use of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the focus on counter-terrorism and the role of the United Nations suggests the involvement of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
