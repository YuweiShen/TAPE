The use of modular systems of linear inequalities and the study of properties of polyhedrons suggest a connection to discrete mathematics and optimization (cs.DM, cs.OC). The mention of proximity and sparsity of solutions suggests a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the use of close technics and the enumeration of unimodular equivalence classes suggest a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
