This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new multimodal fusion layer that performs reasoning, which suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
