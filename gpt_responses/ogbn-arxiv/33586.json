The paper also involves the study of induced subgraphs, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of complexity theory and dichotomy results suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
