The paper proposes a method for training a helper agent to interactively adapt their behavior to maximize the reward of another agent, without observing their reward or receiving explicit demonstrations. This involves meta-learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
