The use of multiple antennas and precoding techniques also suggests a focus on wireless communication (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's title explicitly mentions MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems, which is a subfield of wireless communication and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
