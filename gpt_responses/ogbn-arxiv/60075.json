The use of nonlocal Retinex model and shearlet-based higher order regularization suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of multiscale sparsified regularization, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of an adaptive variant of total generalized variation, which is a technique commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
