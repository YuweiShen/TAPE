The use of amplify-and-forward protocol and the need for optimal design of preambles and estimators suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the mention of low-complexity class of estimators and numerical results suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
