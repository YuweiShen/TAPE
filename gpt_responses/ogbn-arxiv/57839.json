The proposed method uses abstract interpretation, which is a technique commonly used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed technique into a practical tool, which involves software engineering aspects (cs.SE). The use of abstract domains and tracking program secrets and dependencies falls under the category of control systems and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed technique involves analyzing the performance of the tool, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
