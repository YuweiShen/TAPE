The use of CNNs for recognition tasks also falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of recognizing micro-expressions, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the experiments involve the use of databases, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
