Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which covers topics related to communication and signal processing. The paper also discusses the use of covariance matrices, which are commonly used in network information theory (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes a low-complexity approach, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on massive MIMO systems, which could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
