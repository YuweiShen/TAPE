The paper also discusses the use of skip-connections in architectures such as highway and resnets, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. The paper presents empirical evidence on both fully-connected networks and convnets, which suggests that it could also fall under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
