It also involves information theory (cs.IT) and statistical analysis (cs.MM) to demonstrate the security of the Kirchhoff Law Johnson Noise (KLJN) scheme. The use of thermodynamics and noise in the KLJN scheme also relates to the field of physics (cs.PH). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of secure communication protocols (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
