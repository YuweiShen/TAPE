The focus is on obtaining winning strategies for one of the players, which is a common problem in game theory. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses techniques for obtaining sparse winning strategies, which is a problem that arises in many AI applications, such as planning and decision making. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses logical formalisms to model safety games and winning strategies. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions that the problem of obtaining sparse winning strategies is NP-hard, which is a classic result in algorithms and complexity theory. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses different techniques for representing and computing winning strategies, which is a problem that is relevant to programming language design and implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
