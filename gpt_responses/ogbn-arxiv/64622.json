The use of discrepancy as a tool for proving lower bounds is a well-established technique in randomized communication complexity, and this paper extends it to information complexity. Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with information theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as the second likely sub-category. The paper also involves the study of functions and distributions, which are topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), respectively. Finally, the paper may have applications in computational geometry, which is a topic in cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
