This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a probabilistic model for learning multiple tasks, which involves deriving an expectation-maximization algorithm for learning the model. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for learning multiple tasks across heterogeneous domains, which involves jointly learning domain transforms and a shared classifier. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes a method for learning multiple tasks across heterogeneous domains, which could involve visual data. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition sub-category. \n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a method for learning multiple tasks across heterogeneous domains, which could involve natural language data. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computation and Language sub-category. \n\ncs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a method for learning multiple tasks across heterogeneous domains, which could involve social network data.
