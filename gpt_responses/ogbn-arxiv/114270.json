The paper also mentions the use of large-scale datasets and evaluation servers, which are common in the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the tracking of multiple people, which is relevant to the field of robotics (cs.RO) where tracking and interaction with multiple agents is a common problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
