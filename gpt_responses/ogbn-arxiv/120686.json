The paper also involves optimization and algorithm development, which could be categorized under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The problem of minimizing the number of UAVs required for continuous coverage is a combinatorial optimization problem, which could be classified under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
