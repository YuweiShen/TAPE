The use of pretrained language models such as BERT and the adaptation to the scientific domain suggest that the paper could belong to sub-categories such as Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computation and Language (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Deep Learning (cs.DL), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). However, since the focus is on recommending citations in scientific literature, Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computation and Language (cs.CL) are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
