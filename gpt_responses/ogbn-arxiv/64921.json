It also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel stochastic temporal model, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The residual update rule used in the model is inspired by discretization schemes of differential equations, which could place it in the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with training difficulties, which could suggest that it belongs to the Software Engineering (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
