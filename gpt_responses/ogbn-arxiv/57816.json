These are all related to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of deep learning algorithms for these tasks falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of automatic video annotation tools, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
