The use of deep learning algorithms and policy gradient methods suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the decentralized nature of the multi-robot system, which suggests that it may belong to the categories of control systems (cs.SY) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
