The paper also discusses the use of gradient descent and introduces a new framework called Mirror Descent. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning), \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with optimization and numerical stability, which could fall under \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
