The use of orthonormal bases and dictionaries also suggests a connection to linear algebra and machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of coherence and cardinality in the abstract suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) perspective. Finally, the use of probabilistic models may also relate to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
