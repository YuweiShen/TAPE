Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a method that involves uncertainty estimation in the optimization objective, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on a cross-city benchmark, which is related to robotics (RO). Finally, the paper deals with image data, which is a common topic in multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
