This involves the use of deep learning techniques for compact depth map representation and the reformulation of different types of errors within standard factor graph software. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also makes use of learned priors (cs.AI) and presents examples of estimated dense geometry (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
