The use of large field-of-view cameras is a recent trend in these areas, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. Finally, the paper proposes a new camera model that is computationally efficient and has a closed-form inverse, which may be of interest to researchers in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) who work on optimization and modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
