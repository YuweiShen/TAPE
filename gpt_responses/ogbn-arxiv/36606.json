The paper does not focus on a specific area of computer science, but rather on the broader field of science as a whole. However, the paper does mention the use of Pajek and VOSviewer, which are commonly used in the fields of digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social networks (cs.SI), cybernetics (cs.CY), and cryptography (cs.CR).
