This involves constructing hidden Markov models and deep neural networks to describe the naturalness of a given fingering in terms of probabilities. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SD (Sound), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
