The paper also deals with computer vision techniques such as object detection and tracking, which makes Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) another likely category. The paper proposes non-reference assessments and online tracklet refinement, which suggests that it may also belong to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the paper conducts experiments on real-world robotic tasks, which suggests that it may also fall under Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
