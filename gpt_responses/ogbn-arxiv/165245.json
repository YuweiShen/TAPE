The proposed method is evaluated on image classification tasks (cs.CV), which is a common application of deep learning. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the method in avoiding bad local optima, which is a common concern in optimization algorithms (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on various datasets, which is a common practice in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
