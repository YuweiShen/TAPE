Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely category. The paper also uses techniques from computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) to model the sensor measurements and the transformation between coordinate systems. The proposed algorithm involves solving optimization problems, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
