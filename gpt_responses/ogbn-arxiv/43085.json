This involves the use of reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn a set of unspecified constraints from demonstrations of the task, and to learn to maximize the environment rewards. The paper also discusses the use of a contextual bandit-based orchestrator that picks a contextually-appropriate choice between the two policies (constraint-based and environment reward-based) when taking actions. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of robotics and control systems, which suggests the sub-categories cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as likely categories. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of ensuring that agents behave in ways aligned with the values of society, which suggests the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
