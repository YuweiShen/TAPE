The proposed algorithm is evaluated in the Atari 2600 domain, which involves computer vision and robotics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves computer vision, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with control policies, which suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
