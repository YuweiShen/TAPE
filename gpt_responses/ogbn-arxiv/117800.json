Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves joint encoding and decoding of messages, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The concept of complementary delivery, where each decoder has access to one of the two messages to enable it to reproduce the other message, is related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also discusses the rate-distortion function, which is a fundamental concept in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper's focus on interesting properties of the rate-distortion function and the coding problem can be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
