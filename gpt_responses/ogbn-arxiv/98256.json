The use of multidimensional data and tensor decompositions suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The mention of optimization problems points towards cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The application of tensor networks to alleviate the curse of dimensionality is relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
