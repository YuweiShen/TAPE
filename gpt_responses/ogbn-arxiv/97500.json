The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers natural language processing and computational linguistics. The use of neural models also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the use of finite state transducers suggests cs.CY (Computational Geometry) as a less likely but still possible sub-category, as finite state transducers are often used in computational linguistics for tasks such as morphological analysis and generation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
