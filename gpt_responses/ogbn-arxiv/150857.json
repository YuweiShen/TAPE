The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning (cs.DL) techniques and the potential application of the proposed method in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
