The paper specifically focuses on the logical structure of the input and equational constraints, which suggests that it may fall under the sub-categories of cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
