The games involve multiple agents controlling the system dynamics, which suggests a connection to control theory (cs.SY). The agents have different information about the system over time, which involves information theory (cs.IT). The paper also provides a backward induction algorithm to compute the equilibria, which involves optimization and decision-making, suggesting a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
