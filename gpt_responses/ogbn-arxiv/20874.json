The paper also discusses lossy compression heuristics and communication cost, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC). The experiments involve training deep neural networks for image classification (cs.CV) and automated speech recognition (cs.CL), which are specific applications of machine learning. Finally, the paper proposes a new compression scheme for gradient updates, which is a novel contribution to optimization algorithms (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
