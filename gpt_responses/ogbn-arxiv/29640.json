Therefore, cs.IR is also a likely sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions using machine learning techniques to solve the WSD problem, which makes cs.LG a possible sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning and NLP techniques to solve a language-related problem falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural or evolutionary computing techniques, these are commonly used in NLP and could potentially be used in the proposed algorithm.
