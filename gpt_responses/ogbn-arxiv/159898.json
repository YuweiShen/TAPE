Therefore, it is likely to belong to the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The proposed solution is based on a self-attentive neural network, which is a machine learning technique, and does not require manual feature extraction, which is a software engineering task. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the categories of Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper deals with the analysis of binary code, which is a low-level representation of software, and does not depend on the programming language or the operating system. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the categories of Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
