This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of visual similarity triplets to learn a low dimensional embedding using CNNs, which is a machine learning (cs.LG) technique. The use of similarity triplets also involves assessing patterns and reducing rater variability, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
