The use of intermediate abstract representations and the development of a new loss function suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The application of the framework to retinal images suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
