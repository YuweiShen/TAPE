The use of label distribution learning and multi-loss function also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The practical applications mentioned, such as human-robot interaction and driver monitoring, suggest a potential interest in multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
