The study of many-user systems also involves networked communication, which could place the paper in the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The use of numerical examples and analysis of Gaussian channels suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. The study of capacity and optimization in communication systems could also place the paper in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. Finally, the study of degraded channels and the notion of capacity could also make the paper relevant to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
