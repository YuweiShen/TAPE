Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the impact of system parameters on performance, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper addresses security and robustness issues, which are relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents a prototype implementation, which is related to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
