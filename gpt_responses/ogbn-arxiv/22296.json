Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper proposes a probabilistic caption-filtering method and a weakly supervised strategy for training the visual feature extractor, which are related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of automatic metrics and subjective evaluations, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
