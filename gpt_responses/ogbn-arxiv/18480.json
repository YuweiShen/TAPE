Additionally, the library is adapted from the scikit-learn interface, which is a popular machine learning library in Python. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) because statistical relational models are often used in AI applications such as natural language processing and knowledge representation. \n\nThe sub-category of databases (cs.DB) is also a possibility because statistical relational models are used in database applications such as data integration and entity resolution. \n\nThe sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) is another possibility because statistical relational models are used in natural language processing tasks such as semantic parsing and relation extraction. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) is a less likely possibility because statistical relational models have been used in security applications such as malware detection and intrusion detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
