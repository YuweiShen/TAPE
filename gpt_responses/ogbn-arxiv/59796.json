Additionally, the use of a discretized-Dijkstra wavefront algorithm implies that it may also fall under the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The problem involves weights and optimization, which could place it in the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. The use of approximation algorithms and optimization suggests that it may also belong to the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category.
