The proposed method involves estimating the level of ambiguity in detection scores and dynamically assigning probabilities to hypotheses, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and probabilistic reasoning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of the Dempster's combination rule, which is a common method in information fusion (cs.CR). Finally, the experiments involve the use of datasets, which suggests the use of information retrieval techniques (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
