The use of belief functions is also a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the relationship between their proposed systems and other non-monotonic systems, which falls under the category of logic and computation (cs.LO). The paper also addresses issues related to ambiguity and redundancy, which are common topics in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents a new approach to dealing with default information, which could be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
