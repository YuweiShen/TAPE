This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI), as well as computer security (cs.CR) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the need for authentication and encryption. Additionally, the paper covers game theory and stochastic geometry, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
