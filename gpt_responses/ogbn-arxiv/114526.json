Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the role of non-linear layers in capacity allocation, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper mentions the effective receptive field and ResNets, which are concepts commonly used in computer vision, indicating that it could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the propagation of capacity through layers, which is a topic relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
