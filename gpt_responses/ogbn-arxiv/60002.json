The use of multiple relays and beamforming techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of multimedia (cs.MM) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes new techniques for achieving the secure degrees of freedom, which could be considered a form of optimization or algorithm design, placing it in the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
