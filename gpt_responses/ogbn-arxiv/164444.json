The proposed method uses energy minimization and combines several features to model the projection of coplanar repeats into images and their interactions with scene planes. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), and multi-model fitting (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses an inference framework based on a recent variant of $\\alpha$-expansion, which is a common optimization technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.MM, cs.AI, and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
