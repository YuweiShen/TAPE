Therefore, cs.CL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses integer linear programming (ILP) to select the most informative and well-formed sub-graph, which falls under the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper focuses on improving the readability of the generated summaries, which is related to the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
