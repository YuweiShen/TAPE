The paper proposes a new class of lifted models that use Lagrange Multipliers to arrive at a rigorous lower bound of the traditional neural network training problem. This is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a new optimization method that is parallelizable across data points and/or layers, which is relevant to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of non-convex functions, which is a topic that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
