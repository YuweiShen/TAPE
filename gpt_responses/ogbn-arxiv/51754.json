The approach combines a learnable embedding function and a pairwise node comparison method to achieve better generalization on unseen graphs and reduce computational burden. The paper focuses on the application of graph similarity computation and proposes a new direction for future research on this topic. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
