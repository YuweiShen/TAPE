The paper proposes a method that uses deep reinforcement learning to learn communication protocols for the agents, which is a common approach in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method in a simulated 2D-physics environment, which is a common approach in the field of robotics (cs.RO). The paper uses Trust Region Policy Optimization, which is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of learning complex collaborative tasks, which is a core topic in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
