The use of non-uniform inputs and linear codes suggests a possible connection to network information theory (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The mention of a rateless transmission scheme also suggests a possible connection to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
