The paper also discusses the need for widely applicable benchmarks to evaluate RL algorithms, which falls under the subfield of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The implementation of the testing domain involves scalability and flexibility, which are key aspects of Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges presented by the testing domain, which is related to Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
