The use of metric spaces suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures, which falls under cs.DS. The preemptive service algorithm and its novel combination of time forwarding and spatial exploration suggest a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, which falls under cs.LG and cs.AI.
