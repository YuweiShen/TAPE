The paper proposes a new approach for low-complexity algorithms, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also involves mathematical derivations and analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which suggests that it may be relevant to researchers in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper deals with data structures and algorithms for efficient computation, which may be of interest to researchers in data science (cs.DS) and computational science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
