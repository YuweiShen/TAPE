The experiments are conducted on synthetic and real datasets commonly used in computer vision (MNIST and OMNIGLOT). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper proposes a new objective function, which involves information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely sub-category as well. Finally, the paper deals with the issue of random noise objects, which is related to the field of neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
