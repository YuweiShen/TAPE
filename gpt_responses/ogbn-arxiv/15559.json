The approach proposed in the paper is based on deep learning-based semantic segmentation, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses statistical fusion approaches, which are related to machine learning and statistics (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper aims to improve the robustness of real-world operations, which is a key concern in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
