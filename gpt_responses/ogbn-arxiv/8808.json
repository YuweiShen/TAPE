The use of function approximation raises computational and statistical challenges, which are addressed in the paper. The paper focuses on the linear setting, which is a common and important setting in RL. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
