The agents use a microscopic traffic model to predict the effects of their control actions, which is a typical application of multi-agent systems. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The agents in the proposed system use a predictive interval microscopic model to make decisions, which involves the use of AI techniques such as machine learning and decision-making algorithms. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a system for controlling traffic in an urban road network, which involves the use of control theory and optimization techniques. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The use of a predictive interval microscopic model by the agents can be seen as a machine learning approach to traffic control. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics) - Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the use of agents to control traffic signals can be seen as a form of robotic control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
