The paper proposes a new method for implementing erasure codes. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of scheduling to reduce the number of operations in the proposed method, which is a common technique in systems and control theory. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Finite field operations are used extensively in cryptography and security applications. The proposed method could potentially have applications in these areas. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of finite field operations and proposes a method to reduce it, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
