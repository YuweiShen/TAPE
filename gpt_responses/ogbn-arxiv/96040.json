The use of Faster-RCNN and MTCNN for detecting human presence and extracting faces, and LBP/FaceNet for identifying a person and groups, are all techniques commonly used in computer vision. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper aims to enhance safety and promote the independence of people with disabilities by providing easier and safer access to a smart home. The use of a dialog-enabled interface to create a personalized profile using face images or video of friend/families/caregiver is an example of human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the ability of the system to grant/deny remote access to the premises or ability to call emergency services, which are security-related features. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions the use of MMS to send a visual summary to the users containing a person's name, scene image, facial description, and contextual information. This involves the use of multimedia technologies. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the challenges of building a robust recognition engine that meets the system criteria and addresses speed, accuracy, deployment"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
