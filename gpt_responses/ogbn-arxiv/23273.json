The method proposed in the paper involves analyzing the positions and normals of stroke ribbons, which is a task that can be tackled using computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the need for a novel surfacing approach due to the distinct inputs, which suggests that the paper may fall under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to match stroke polyline vertices and edges, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
