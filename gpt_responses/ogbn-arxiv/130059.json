The proposed method involves deep learning architectures, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on multimedia datasets (cs.MM) and proposes a stochastic batch-wise training routine, which falls under the category of optimization algorithms (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
