The use of 1-bit quantization and the need for efficient processing methods suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of blind direction-of-arrival (DOA) parameter estimation with an array of sensors suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine vision (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
