Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses communication transceiver architectures, which falls under cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also explores the feasibility of DSP-centric transceiver architectures, which is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the impact of low-precision ADC on communication bandwidths, which is related to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper uses numerical computations to evaluate the capacity of low-precision ADC, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
