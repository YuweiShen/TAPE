The focus is on partial information feedback, which is a common problem in reinforcement learning. The paper also discusses bandit and semi-bandit problems, which are classic topics in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
