This involves analyzing the system efficiency in terms of price of anarchy (PoA), which characterizes the degradation of the system efficiency due to selfish behavior of users. The paper also discusses the proliferation of smart mobile devices and the explosive growth of mobile crowd-learning services. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
