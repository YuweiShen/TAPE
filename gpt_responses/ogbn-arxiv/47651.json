The paper focuses on the prediction of physical systems, which suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The use of known governing laws and regularization of data-driven DNN models suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE) or systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's focus on metamodeling for a random Burgers' system and for aerodynamic analysis of passenger vehicles suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
