The paper also presents practical methods for restoring signals that have been degraded by a known linear operator, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of compression techniques for signal restoration, which is relevant to both information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also presents a shift-invariant complexity regularizer, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper presents experiments on image deblurring and inpainting, which are common tasks in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
