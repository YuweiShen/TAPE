The approach involves image processing techniques such as segmentation, classification, and tracking, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The application of the proposed approach is in the medical treatment, healthcare, and fitness sectors, which falls under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of mobile methods, which can be related to mobile computing (cs.MM). The approach involves optimization techniques, which can be related to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of motion artifacts and low spatial resolution, which can be related to signal processing (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
