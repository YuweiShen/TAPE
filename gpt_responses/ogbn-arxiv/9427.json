The paper proposes a novel thresholding based iterative algorithm with per-iteration complexity at most linear in the data size, which is a common technique used in machine learning and optimization. The paper also discusses the special case where the inliers are obtained from a low-dimensional subspace with additive Gaussian noise, which is a common setting in computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves some information theory and numerical analysis, which makes cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
