It also discusses specific aspects of web applications that make it challenging to build an efficient web IDS, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the prevention mechanism of the IDS, which relates to cyber security (cs.CY) and system and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper compares the features of different existing detection systems, which relates to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
