The optimization method used in the paper involves backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which are also commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on the ImageNet dataset, which is a common benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
