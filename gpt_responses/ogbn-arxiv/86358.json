The paper also mentions the minimum average probability of error, which is a common topic in the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The analysis of probability distributions and their norms is a common topic in the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the study of mutual information is a common topic in the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
