Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the properties of square-summable signals, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SP (Signal Processing) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical analysis to prove its results, which could place it in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
