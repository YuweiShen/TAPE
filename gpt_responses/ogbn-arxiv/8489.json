Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes novel attention mechanisms and uses reinforcement learning, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for automatic captioning of vast repositories of figures, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
