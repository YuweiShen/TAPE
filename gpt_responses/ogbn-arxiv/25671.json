Answers and Stack Overflow. This problem domain has been the subject of much research and includes both language-agnostic as well as language conscious solutions. The paper proposes a framework for Question Difficulty and Expertise Estimation (QDEE) in CQAs, which estimates question difficulty and user expertise by identifying key hierarchical structure within the popular competition (directed) graph model. The paper also proposes a model to route newly posted questions to appropriate users based on the difficulty level of the question and the expertise of the user. The paper uses real world CQAs such as Yahoo! Answers and Stack Overflow data for extensive experiments. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SD (Software Engineering), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
