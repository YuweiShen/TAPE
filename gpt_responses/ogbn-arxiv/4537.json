This involves planning out actions and information transmission based on the human's preferences, which are modeled information-theoretically. The paper uses a belief MDP framework and gives a tractable algorithm for solving it approximately. The paper also proposes an algorithm for online learning of the human's preferences through exploration. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also deals with information theory and learning, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves planning and decision-making, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
