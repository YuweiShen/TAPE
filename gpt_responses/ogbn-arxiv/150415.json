This topic falls under the sub-category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is covered by cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of embeddings suggests the use of machine learning techniques, which are covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The task of detecting whether the same sense occurs in a pair of sentences involves similarity and matching, which are covered by cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of embeddings for WSD can also be related to neural networks, which are covered by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
