Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory) which deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information. The paper also discusses communication and signal design, which makes cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) another likely category. The use of electromagnetic waves for power transfer makes cs.EM (Electromagnetics) a possible category. The paper also discusses the design of a system consisting of multiple blocks, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) for the prototype, which makes cs.ETM (Embedded Systems) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
