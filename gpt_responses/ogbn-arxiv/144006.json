This involves the use of wireless communication to control the velocity of vehicles and adjust the arrival time of an approaching platoon. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper proposes a scheduling agent for each intersection, which senses the traffic approaching its intersection and constructs a schedule that minimizes the cumulative wait time of vehicles. This involves coordination and communication between multiple agents, which falls under the scope of multiagent systems. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper involves the use of autonomous vehicles to improve traffic flow, which falls under the scope of robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a control algorithm that adjusts the arrival time of an approaching platoon through wireless communication, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves the use of wireless communication to control the velocity of vehicles and adjust the arrival time of an approaching platoon, which falls under the scope of information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper involves the use of wireless communication to control the velocity of vehicles and adjust the arrival time of an approaching platoon,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
