The method also accounts for partial occlusions and explicitly factors in viewpoint changes and object deformations, which are related to robotics (RO) and machine learning (LG) techniques. The paper introduces a novel regularization technique, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization (GR) techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
