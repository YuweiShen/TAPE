The paper also discusses the use of generative models and feedback connections in the visual system, which could potentially fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new training method for neural networks, which could fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
