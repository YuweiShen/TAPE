This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of deep learning models for encoding and predicting correspondences suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of 3D meshes and surface representations suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
