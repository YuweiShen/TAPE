The use of feature extraction and recognition algorithms suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of a database and testing methodology suggests that the paper may also fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
