The framework incorporates appropriate inductive bias by designing the associated computation graph in a physics-informed manner, enforcing Hamiltonian dynamics with control to learn the underlying dynamics in a transparent way. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
