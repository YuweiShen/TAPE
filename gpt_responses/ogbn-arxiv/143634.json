The paper discusses the loss landscape of regularized linear autoencoders and their ability to learn principal directions. This is a core topic in machine learning and falls under the cs.LG sub-category.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Autoencoders are a type of neural network, and the paper discusses their properties and behavior. This falls under the cs.NE sub-category, which deals with the study of neural networks and their applications.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Autoencoders are widely used in computer vision applications, such as image denoising and compression. The paper discusses the properties of autoencoders and their ability to learn principal directions, which is relevant to computer vision applications. This falls under the cs.CV sub-category.\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of regularization in linear autoencoders and its effect on the loss landscape. This falls under the cs.IT sub-category, which deals with the study of information theory and its applications.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the properties of autoencoders and their ability to learn principal directions, which is relevant to the study of social and information networks.
