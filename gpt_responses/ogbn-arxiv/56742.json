The concept of genus is also relevant in graph theory (cs.GT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of rectangular faces suggests a possible connection to data structures (cs.DS) and the study of polyhedra in general falls under the category of mathematical modeling (cs.MG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
