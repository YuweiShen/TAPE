This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses reduced-connectivity RF switching networks for reducing the analog hardware complexity and switching power losses in antenna selection systems. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses different hardware architectures for implementing the RF switching matrices required in AS designs with a reduced number of RF chains. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the energy efficiency of massive MIMO systems, which is a multimedia application. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the hardware architecture for implementing the RF switching matrices required in AS designs with a reduced number of RF chains, which falls under the scope of hardware architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
