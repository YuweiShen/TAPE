The use of persistent memory and distributed algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the problem of mutual visibility and coordination of movements can be seen as a control systems problem, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
