The paper also mentions the use of information theory (cs.IT) in the design of the generator. The use of coupled chaotic maps suggests a potential application in control systems (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the modification of the maps and perturbation of their bits suggests a potential application in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
