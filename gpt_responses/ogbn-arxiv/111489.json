The specific channel being studied is a broadcast channel, which falls under the category of communication networks (cs.COMM). The use of feedback in the channel also makes it relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves coding schemes and proof techniques, which are related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
