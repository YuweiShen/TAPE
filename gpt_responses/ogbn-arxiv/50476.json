The paper also mentions the use of a branch and bound algorithm, which is a common optimization technique in computer engineering (cs.CE) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's focus on constructing explanations from a fixed set of possible hypotheses suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of symbolic AI (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
