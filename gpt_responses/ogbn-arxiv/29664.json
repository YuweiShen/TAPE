This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of proper Contention Window (CW) based on the estimated number of active contenders in the network. This involves the use of information theory concepts to optimize network performance. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper proposes a collaborative approach for stations to achieve higher network performance. This involves social and information networks where nodes collaborate to achieve a common goal. \n\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper may involve security considerations in the proposed CSMA/ECA-DR MAC protocol. \n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed CSMA/ECA-DR MAC protocol involves distributed reservation mechanism for stations to collaboratively achieve higher network performance.
