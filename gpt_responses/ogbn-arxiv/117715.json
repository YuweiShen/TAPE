The paper presents a measurement study of smart home IoT devices in the wild, which involves collecting network traffic logs from more than 200 homes across a large metropolitan area in the United States. The paper characterizes smart home IoT traffic in terms of its volume, temporal patterns, and external endpoints, and highlights several security and privacy concerns in the smart home IoT ecosystem. Overall, the paper's interdisciplinary nature and focus on IoT security and privacy make cs.CR and cs.NI the most likely categories, followed by cs.SY, cs.HC, and cs.CY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
