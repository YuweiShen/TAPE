The paper specifically focuses on bilinear systems, which are a type of bihomogeneous system where all equations have bidegree (1,1). Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.AC (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and complexity for natural language processing and computational linguistics. While the paper does not deal with natural language processing, it does deal with algorithms and complexity for solving structured algebraic systems, which is a computational problem.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Algebraic Manipulation): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and complexity for symbolic computation and algebraic manipulation. The paper clearly falls under this sub-category as it deals with Gr\u00f6bner bases algorithms for solving multihomogeneous systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the study of systems and control theory, which includes the study of algebraic systems. While the paper does not deal with control theory, it does deal with algebraic systems and their solutions.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the study of data structures and algorithms. While the paper does not deal with data structures, it does deal with algorithms for solving multihomogeneous systems.\n"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
