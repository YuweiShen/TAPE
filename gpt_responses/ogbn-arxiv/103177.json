The paper also discusses the integration of high-level reasoning and low-level reasoning, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The experiments conducted in the paper involve analyzing the computational efficiency and plan quality, which are topics covered in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also mentions experiments in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
