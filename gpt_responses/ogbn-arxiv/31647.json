The use of Massive MIMO and beamforming techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of quantization and artificial noise techniques may also place the paper under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
