It also provides formal analyses for clock skew-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that detect masquerade attacks in CAN. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of formal models and analyses for IDSs, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.SE (Software Engineering). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the use of Network Time Protocol (NTP) and hardware platforms, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
