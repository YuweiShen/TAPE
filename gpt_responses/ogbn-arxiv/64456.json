It could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it formulates the rate adaptation problem as an online stochastic optimization problem. Additionally, it could be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it presents a family of algorithms that learn the best (mode, rate) pair for transmission. It could also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with optimizing the performance of a system. Finally, it could be classified under cs.MM (Multimedia) as it studies the throughput loss in packet transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
