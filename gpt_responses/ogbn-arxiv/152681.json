This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the generator polynomials of these codes and their Gray images, which are related to error-correcting codes and cryptography, falling under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of automorphisms and structural properties of the skew polynomial ring, which are related to algebraic structures and algorithms, falling under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and the symbolic computation (cs.SC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the generalization of these codes to double skew constacyclic codes, which is related to the theory of linear codes and their constructions, falling under the logic in computer science (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
