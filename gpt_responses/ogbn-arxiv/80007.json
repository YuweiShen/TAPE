The algorithms used in the paper involve geometric problems such as furthest-pair and closest-pair, which are typically studied in computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the problem of maximum inner product, which is a well-studied problem in optimization and linear algebra (cs.DM). Finally, the paper uses techniques from network coding (cs.NE) to prove its results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
