The proposed Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC) scheme involves signal processing and optimization techniques, which are relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also proposes two algorithms for the second step of the BKIC scheme, which involve statistical inference and machine learning techniques, relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
