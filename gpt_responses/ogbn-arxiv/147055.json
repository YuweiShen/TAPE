Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes new access methods that can scale to large databases, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DB (Databases). The use of dynamic programming and heuristics for finding the best connected subregion from a tile score matrix indicates that it could also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions that their search strategies are general enough to work with other scoring schemes and heuristics, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
