This is a problem that falls under the intersection of several sub-fields in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV). Given that the paper focuses on learning arbitrary nonlinear cost functions using neural networks and applies the method to torque control of high-dimensional robotic systems, cs.LG and cs.RO are the most likely sub-categories. However, the paper also discusses the use of MaxEnt IOC and evaluates the method on real-world robotic manipulation problems, which suggests that cs.AI, cs.SY, and cs.CV are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
