It also involves training the memory system on a set of challenging maze environments, which is a common task in machine learning research. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves developing a memory system that enables intelligent reasoning in partially observable environments. \n\nThe paper also involves working with 3D environments, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as 3D environments are often used in computer vision research. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves developing a memory system that is customized to the sorts of 3D environments that DRL agents typically interact with, which suggests that it could belong to cs.RO (Robotics) as robotics research often involves developing specialized systems for interacting with the environment. \n\nFinally, the paper involves developing a memory system that uses a spatially structured 2D memory image to store information about the environment over long time lags, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it involves developing a neural network architecture for memory storage."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
