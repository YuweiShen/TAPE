The paper also proposes a machine learning-based access control framework, which could be categorized under information retrieval (cs.IR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The focus on resource-constrained IoT devices suggests a possible category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses threat models and access control issues, which could be categorized under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
