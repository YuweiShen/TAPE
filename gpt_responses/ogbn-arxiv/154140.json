This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the challenges of online boycotts and proposes a new tool that leverages social computing to address these challenges. This aligns with the focus of the cs.SI sub-category, which covers research on social networks, online communities, and social computing systems. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper examines the potential of boycott-assisting technologies to promote pro-social behavior and highlights the need to consider the ethical implications of such technologies. This aligns with the focus of the cs.CY sub-category, which covers research on the social and ethical aspects of computing. \n- cs.CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing): The paper describes a new tool that aims to facilitate cooperation and coordination among participants in online boycotts. This aligns with the focus of the cs.CSCW sub-category, which covers research on the design, implementation, and evaluation of systems that support collaborative work and social interaction. \n- cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the role of social networks in online boycotts and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
