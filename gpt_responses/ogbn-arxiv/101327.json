The approach also involves incorporating domain knowledge through natural language captions and attributes, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions providing textual explanations for the predictions made by the classifiers, which could involve information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
