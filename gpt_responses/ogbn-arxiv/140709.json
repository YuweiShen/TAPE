The proposed approach involves formulating the problem as a Markov decision process and using a recurrent network to model a policy for frame selection, which falls under the category of reinforcement learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve benchmark datasets for activity detection (cs.MM) and the paper also discusses the computational complexity of the approach, which relates to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
