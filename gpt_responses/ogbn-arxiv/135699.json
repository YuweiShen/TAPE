The attack also involves exploiting microarchitectural structures, which could potentially fall under computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the impact on operating systems, virtual machines, and SGX enclaves, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and network security (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses potential mitigation approaches, which could fall under programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
