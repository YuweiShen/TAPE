This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves transmitting information over a noisy channel. The problem also involves decision-making and control (cs.SY) as the sensor and estimator must make decisions to minimize the worst-case maximum instantaneous estimation error. The paper uses mathematical optimization techniques to find optimal strategies, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the paper involves real-time estimation of the source state, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
