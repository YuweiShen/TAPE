Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of fully convolutional neural networks also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves some information retrieval techniques for counting the number of berries in one image, which could place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category. Finally, the use of neural networks for yield estimation could also suggest a connection to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
