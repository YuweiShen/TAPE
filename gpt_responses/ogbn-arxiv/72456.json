This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the distribution of budgets and the order of strategic decisions, which involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The concept of budget games can also be applied to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
