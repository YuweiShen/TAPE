This involves embedding novel class representations into the existing space of previously seen classes in a globally consistent manner. The paper focuses on classification tasks and proposes a novel model that incorporates inter-class relations using graph-convolution. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper involves natural language processing tasks, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
