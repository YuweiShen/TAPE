The use of a Simplicity Principle also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents a framework for reconsidering the learnability of natural language, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
