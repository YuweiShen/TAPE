This is a security concern, as it can result in unequal treatment of different neighborhoods and populations. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a mathematical model of predictive policing and suggests ways to modify the inputs to prevent feedback loops. This involves using machine learning techniques to optimize the allocation of police resources. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the social implications of predictive policing, particularly in terms of fairness and accountability. It discusses the potential for bias and discrimination in the use of these systems, and proposes solutions to mitigate these issues. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes the interaction between reported and discovered incidents of crime, and how this affects the feedback loop in predictive policing. This involves studying the dynamics of social networks and information flow in the context of law enforcement. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a control-theoretic approach to predictive policing, where the goal is to optimize the allocation of police resources while minimizing the risk of feedback loops. This involves designing feedback mechanisms and control policies to achieve the desired outcomes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
