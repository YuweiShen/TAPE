Therefore, cs.CY is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes different grading schemes that use statistical properties of the grade distribution, which is a machine learning approach. Therefore, cs.LG is also a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper discusses the use of peer grading systems in language-related courses, and proposes a hierarchical extension of the supervised scheme that can handle classes of any size. Therefore, cs.CL is another likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes different incentive schemes that use statistical properties of the grade distribution, which is related to data analysis and algorithms. Therefore, cs.DS is also a possible sub-category.\n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the issue of non-truthful grading in peer grading systems, which is related to social networks and information sharing. Therefore, cs.SI is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
