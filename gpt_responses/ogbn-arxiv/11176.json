Specifically, the paper focuses on the online versions of these problems in higher dimensions, using the $L_\\infty$ norm. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, such as data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
