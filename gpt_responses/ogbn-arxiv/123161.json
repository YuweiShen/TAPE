The use of continuous utility functions suggests a focus on optimization and numerical methods, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents new characterizations of correlated equilibria, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and statistical inference (cs.LG, cs.SI). Finally, the construction of effective algorithms for approximating correlated equilibria involves computational complexity and algorithm design, which are relevant to both data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
