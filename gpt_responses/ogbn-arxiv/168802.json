This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of CNNs also suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed method to diverse working conditions, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of transfer learning to address the issue of insufficient labelled data, which is a common problem in neural networks and could fall under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
