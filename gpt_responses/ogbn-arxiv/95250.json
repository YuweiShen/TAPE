The use of a classifier to bias the planner away from unreliable state-action pairs is a machine learning approach, which suggests that cs.AI and cs.LG are likely categories. The problem of motion planning in deformable objects is a robotics problem, which suggests that cs.RO is also a likely category. The use of a Virtual Elastic Band (VEB) approximation to the true dynamics suggests that cs.CV may also be a relevant category. Finally, the use of a classifier to improve the success rate of the planner suggests that cs.SY may also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
