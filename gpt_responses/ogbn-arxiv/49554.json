The paper specifically focuses on the effectiveness of neural networks, which falls under the sub-category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of neural networks, which could also be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE).
