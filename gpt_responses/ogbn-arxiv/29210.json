It also discusses the logic and properties of these games. This falls under the scope of game theory. \n\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with systems with continuous dynamics and introduces a new type of system, i.e., differential hybrid games. It also discusses the properties of these systems. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper introduces new modalities for differential hybrid games and discusses the logic of these games. This falls under the scope of logic in computer science. \n\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the interaction between two players in differential hybrid games, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence research. \n\n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper deals with games involving multiple agents, which falls under the scope of multiagent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
