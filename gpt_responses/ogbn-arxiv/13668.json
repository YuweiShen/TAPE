The paper also introduces a new sieving procedure that significantly improves the running time of the algorithm for SVP in the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm. This suggests that the paper could belong to categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
