The paper proposes an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of completion time, local computation energy, and transmission energy of all users. The problem involves joint learning and communication, and the proposed algorithm provides closed-form solutions for time allocation, bandwidth allocation, power control, computation frequency, and learning accuracy. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
