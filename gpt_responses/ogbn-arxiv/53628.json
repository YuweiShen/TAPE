The paper presents a closed-loop analysis for MPGs and provides verifiable conditions for a stochastic game to be an MPG. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to learn policies that approximate the exact variational Nash equilibrium of the game. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents an optimal control problem to find the Nash equilibrium of the game and discusses the use of closed-loop policies that adapt to stochastic transitions. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of deep neural networks as parametric policies to solve the game. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper is focused on analyzing and solving stochastic games, which are a type of multiagent system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
