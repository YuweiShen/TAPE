It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves retrieving relevant evidence sentences from a large corpus of documents. Additionally, it could be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it uses deep learning techniques to train the BERT models.
