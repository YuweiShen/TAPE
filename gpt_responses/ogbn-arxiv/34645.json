The use of monotone local search and parameterized algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
