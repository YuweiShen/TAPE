The paper also mentions the use of active appearance models (AAMs) which are commonly used in computer vision applications. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image processing and analysis. \n\nThe human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper discusses the challenges of facial expression recognition and normalization. \n\nThe information theory (cs.IT) sub-category may be relevant as the paper discusses the use of ensemble methods to improve face recognition accuracy. \n\nFinally, the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses the development of a person-specific representation robust to transient changes in facial temperature emissions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
