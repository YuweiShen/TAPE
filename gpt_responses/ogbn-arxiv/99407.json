The use of a computer program to confirm known values and prove tight bounds suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The game theory aspect of the problem, where the codebreaker tries to minimize the number of questions asked, suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of game theory (cs.GT) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
