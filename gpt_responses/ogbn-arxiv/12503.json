It could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as robotics and VR/AR applications are mentioned in the abstract. The paper proposes a new method for spatio-temporal perception using convolutional neural networks, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of sparse tensors, which could be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
