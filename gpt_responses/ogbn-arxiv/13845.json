This suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics (RO) for autonomous driving, as well as machine learning (LG) for the proposed approach. The use of reinforcement learning (RL) and curriculum learning also supports the likelihood of the paper falling under the sub-category of AI. Additionally, the potential use of computer vision (CV) for sensing the environment and detecting other vehicles further supports the inclusion of this sub-category. Finally, the mention of uncertainties in real-world scenarios suggests a possible connection to systems and control (SY) for handling such uncertainties."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
