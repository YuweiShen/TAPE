The use of graphics cards to speed up training is also a common technique in neural network research, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of committees of MLPs, which is a technique commonly used in ensemble learning (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
