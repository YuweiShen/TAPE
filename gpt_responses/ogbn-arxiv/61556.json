This is a key problem in information theory, making cs.IT the most likely category. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): Millimeter wave systems are often used for high-speed multimedia applications, such as wireless video streaming. The paper's focus on hybrid precoding for millimeter wave systems suggests that cs.MM is a likely category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a switch network that is adaptive to channel states, which involves designing a control system to optimize the network's performance. This makes cs.SY a likely category. \n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a hardware-efficient implementation for hybrid precoding, which involves designing an analog network structure. This makes cs.AR a possible category. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper's focus on hybrid precoding for millimeter wave systems suggests that it may be relevant to networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
