The authors analyze the source code, bytecode, and execution traces of wallet contracts to derive usage scenarios and patterns, and discuss methods for identifying wallet contracts. This suggests a strong connection to the cryptography and security subfield.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper also deals with the design and implementation of on-chain wallets as smart contracts, which involves software engineering principles and practices. The authors extract blueprints for wallets and differentiate characteristics of wallets in use, which are relevant to software engineering research.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper is based on the analysis of data from the Ethereum main chain, which is a distributed and decentralized blockchain platform. The authors discuss the creation and use of wallet contracts, which are executed on the Ethereum virtual machine in a distributed manner. This suggests a connection to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing subfield.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with the implementation of on-chain wallets as smart contracts, which involves programming languages such as Solidity (used for Ethereum smart contracts). The authors analyze the bytecode of wallet contracts and discuss methods for identifying them, which are relevant to programming language research.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
