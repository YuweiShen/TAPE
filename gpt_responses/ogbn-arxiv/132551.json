The paper also discusses Poisson approximation results, which are relevant to the cs.PR (Probability) sub-category. The use of convolutions of discrete distributions suggests a connection to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category. The paper also introduces a Markov chain, which is a common topic in the cs.ST (Statistics) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on limit theorems and nonasymptotic bounds suggests a connection to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
