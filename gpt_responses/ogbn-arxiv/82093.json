The paper also discusses the use of proportional fairness (PF) criterion, which is a well-known concept in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper presents simulation results, which suggests the use of multimedia applications (cs.MM) and system-level design (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a modified PF criterion, which can be considered as a contribution to the field of performance evaluation and optimization (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
