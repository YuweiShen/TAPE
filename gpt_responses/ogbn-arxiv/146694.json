The proposed method also involves image rectification, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of smartphones, which suggests a potential application in mobile computing (cs.MM). The method's robustness to slight movements of the dual-lens cameras also implies a possible application in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper's use of optimization techniques for computing the homography matrix suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
