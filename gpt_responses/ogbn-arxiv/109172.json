The paper also discusses the use of constraints and similarity measures, which are common in machine learning (cs.MM - Multimedia) and data mining (cs.LG - Machine Learning). The proposed representation can also be used for information retrieval (cs.IR - Information Retrieval) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI - Artificial Intelligence) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
