The paper also discusses the optimization of scaling factors to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance of transmitting constellations, which is a common problem in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the design of NOMA, which is a popular technique in wireless communication networks. The paper also discusses the optimization of power allocation, which is a common problem in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the design of NOMA, which is a popular technique in wireless communication networks. The paper also discusses the optimization of power allocation, which is a common problem in social and information networks. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper formulates an optimization problem and proposes a solution method using the Farey sequence, which is a common technique in computational engineering, finance, and science. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as digital television and satellite communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
