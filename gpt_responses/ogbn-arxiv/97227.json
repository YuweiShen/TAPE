This involves designing pilot codes that are locally orthogonal within each cell while maintaining low inner-product properties between codes in different cells. This topic falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of uplink training for both downlink and uplink transmission in cellular networks. This involves designing pilot codes that can be used to estimate the channel state information for each user. This topic falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of MU-MIMO transmission that is designed to mitigate interference to a subset of strongly interfered out-of-cell users. This involves designing transmission strategies that take into account the social and information network structure of the cellular network. This topic falls under the domain of social and information networks.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of massive MIMO base-stations employing TDD/OFDM for cellular networks. This involves designing transmission strategies that can support multimedia applications with high area spectral and energy efficiencies. This topic falls under the domain of multimedia.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
