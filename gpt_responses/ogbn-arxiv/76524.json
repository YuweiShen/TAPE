The use of probabilistic measures and machine learning techniques to align ontologies also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper presents an approach that can be applied to software engineering (cs.SE) to improve the integration of independently designed ontologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
