The paper also considers the case of asymmetric DoF allocation, which is a common problem in network information theory (cs.NI). The use of beamforming schemes and outer bounds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of achievable schemes for practical implementation, which may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
