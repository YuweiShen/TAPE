The proposed method uses deep learning (cs.LG) and expert knowledge (cs.AI) to improve trajectory tracking. The method is also robust against variations in system dynamics (cs.SY) and operational uncertainties. The learning is divided into two phases, offline and online, which involves training a deep neural network (cs.NE) to control the system. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO, followed by cs.LG, cs.SY, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
