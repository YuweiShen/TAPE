The use of a new CNN architecture and a new database for local material recognition also suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of deep weak supervision, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the potential implications for understanding human material perception suggest that it could also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
