This involves developing models that can generalize across different domains, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on assessing mental workload in real-world conditions, which is relevant to the field of human-computer interaction. The use of EEG to measure mental workload is also a common technique in this field. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses EEG data to assess mental workload, which involves analyzing neural activity. This is relevant to the field of neural computing. \n- cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity): While the paper does not directly relate to cybersecurity, the use of EEG data raises potential privacy concerns that may be relevant to this field. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to develop models that can generalize across different domains, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence.
