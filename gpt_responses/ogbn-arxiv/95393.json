It also presents a novel strategy for constructing operator-dependent RBF. \n\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper applies RBF to solve various engineering problems, such as convection-diffusion problems. \n\n3. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification): The paper presents a conjecture formula for the error bound of RBF, which involves mathematical analysis and proof. \n\n4. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper discusses the implementation and testing of the boundary knot method (BKM), a new RBF collocation technique. \n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): Although not the main focus of the paper, the discussion of node placement and the centrosymmetric matrix structure of the RBF interpolation matrix may be relevant to data structures and algorithms for efficient computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
