This topic is closely related to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of fingerprinting codes in the proof of the lower bound suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
