The paper also mentions maneuvering in environments with obstacles, which is a common problem in robotics and falls under the cs.RO sub-category. The paper also discusses achieving different goals and swarming behaviors, which are topics in the field of control systems and systems engineering, falling under the cs.SY sub-category. The paper also mentions reducing the number of effective edges in the graph, which is a topic in the field of distributed computing, falling under the cs.DC sub-category.
