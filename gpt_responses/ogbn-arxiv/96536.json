Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the potential risks associated with using black-box models, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper proposes a wrapper to improve the trustability of the resulting system, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
