The use of a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed Trajectory-optimized Linear Quadratic Gaussian (T-LQG) approach involves optimization and control, which could also place the paper in the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on planning and uncertainty could also make it relevant to the sub-category of statistics and data analysis (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
