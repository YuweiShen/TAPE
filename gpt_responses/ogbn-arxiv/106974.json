The paper also discusses the challenges of training machine learning algorithms for this task, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the proposed solution involves normalization of pose rotation, which could be related to robotics and control, falling under cs.RO (Robotics and Automation). Finally, the paper discusses the use of synthetic and real datasets, which could be related to computer graphics and visualization, falling under cs.GR (Computer Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
