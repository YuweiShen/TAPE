The paper specifically focuses on classification tasks, which suggests that it could also fall under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks for image classification, which could place it under \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision). The proposed method involves back-propagation, which is a common technique in neural networks and could place the paper under \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of task-specific parameters on the transfer of knowledge, which could also place it under \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
