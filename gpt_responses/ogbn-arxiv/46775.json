This falls under the purview of game theory, which is a subfield of computer science. \n2. cs.AI (Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence): Preference elicitation is a key problem in artificial intelligence, as it is necessary for agents to understand the preferences of other agents in order to make informed decisions. The paper presents algorithms for preference elicitation in the single crossing domain, which is relevant to AI research. \n3. cs.DS (Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents polynomial time algorithms with low query complexity for preference elicitation in the single crossing domain, which involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.LG (Computer Science - Learning): Preference elicitation is a form of learning, as it involves agents learning the preferences of other agents. The paper presents algorithms for preference elicitation in the single crossing domain, which is relevant to learning research. \n5. cs.SI (Computer Science - Social and Information Networks): Preference elicitation is a problem in social choice theory, which is a subfield of social and information networks.
