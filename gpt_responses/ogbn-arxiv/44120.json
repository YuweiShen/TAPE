Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of information theory concepts to optimize the transmission scheduling, which suggests the possibility of cs.IT (Information Theory) as a secondary category. Additionally, the paper involves simulations and performance evaluation, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of full-duplex wireless networks, which could be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
