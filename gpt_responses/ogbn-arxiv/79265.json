The paper also proposes a new method of interference neutralization, which is a technique commonly used in network coding (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the practical aspects of using common randomness, which is a topic related to security and privacy (cs.SI), as well as the optimization of GDoF performance, which is a topic related to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
