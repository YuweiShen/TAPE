The paper also focuses on the challenge of making these techniques explainable to lawyers. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and machine learning for text analysis. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CY (Computers and Society), as the paper also touches on the ethical and societal implications of using machine learning in legal document review."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
