This aligns with the focus of the cs.CR sub-category. \n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of verifiable shuffles and dining cryptographers as key primitives in the Dissent project, which involves scaling these techniques to offer measurable anonymity guarantees to thousands of participants. This aligns with the focus of the cs.DS sub-category. \n\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the state of the art in deployed tools for anonymity on the Internet, such as Tor, and proposes a new anonymity system that offers measurable anonymity guarantees to thousands of participants. This aligns with the focus of the cs.NI sub-category. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper introduces WiNon, an experimental operating system architecture to harden the uses of anonymity tools such as Tor and Dissent against software exploits and accidental self-identification. This aligns with the focus of the cs.SY sub-category. \n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the design and implementation of the Dissent project, which involves building a practical anonymity system based on foundations that"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
