The use of rate splitting and decode-and-forward relaying also suggests the possibility of signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Additionally, the consideration of power constraints and network topology suggests the relevance of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
