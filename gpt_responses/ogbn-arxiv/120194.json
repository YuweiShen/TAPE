This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves programming languages (cs.PL) as it deals with C source code. The paper also involves computer security (cs.CR) as integer overflows are a security threat. The paper's use of symbolic execution suggests that it may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of a user study suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
