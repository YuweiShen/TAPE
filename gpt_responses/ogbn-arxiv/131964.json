This falls under the sub-category of Symbolic Computation (cs.SC). The paper also involves numerical approximations and algorithms, which suggests the sub-category of Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). The use of Taylor shift and Descartes' rule of signs suggests the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also involves the use of data structures and algorithms for counting roots, which suggests the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves the use of programming languages and formal verification, which suggests the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
