The paper also discusses the use of structured knowledge-graph and Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) for propagating node information, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves training the model to learn feature representations, which is a task in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on public benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
