The most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on the challenges of designing and implementing systems to support ML models. The second most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper proposes a new research community at the intersection of traditional systems and ML communities. The paper also mentions hardware systems for ML, which could place it in the cs.AR (Architecture) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses ML optimized for metrics beyond predictive accuracy, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the paper could also belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category, as it discusses the practical concerns that come with broader adoption of ML."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
