Specifically, the paper focuses on optimizing control policies for transfer to unknown environments, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of domain randomization and the simultaneous learning of a family of policies also involves machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and optimization, which could place the paper in categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the need to overcome modeling errors, which could relate to system identification and control theory, placing it in categories such as cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the robotic control problems involve visual perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
