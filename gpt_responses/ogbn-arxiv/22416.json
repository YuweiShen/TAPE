This is a common problem in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which is addressed by many researchers. The paper proposes a novel algorithm to perform filter pruning by using Multi-Objective Evolution Strategy (ES) algorithm, called DeepPruningES. The paper tests the proposed algorithm on three DNN architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks, Residual Neural Networks, and Densely Connected Neural Networks. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which suggest the possibility of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as additional sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
