Information theory is concerned with the fundamental limits of communication and coding, and this paper falls under that domain.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the weight enumerator of the outer code and its expected value, which involves computations and complexity analysis. Hence, it can be categorized under cs.CC.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - Raptor codes are widely used in network coding and communication systems. Hence, this paper can be relevant to the networking and internet architecture community.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Raptor codes can also be used in distributed storage systems and peer-to-peer networks. Hence, this paper can be relevant to the social and information networks community.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the analysis of Raptor codes, which involves the study of algorithms and data structures used in coding and decoding. Hence, it can be categorized under cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
