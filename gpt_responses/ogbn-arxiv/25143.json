This involves gathering robot state information and environmental context information to generate probability distributions of future resource demands. This topic is closely related to robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as systems and control (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV) which are relevant for gathering and processing the necessary information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
