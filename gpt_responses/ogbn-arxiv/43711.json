However, this is less likely than cs.DM. \n3. cs.GT (Graph Theory) - The paper is primarily concerned with the properties of graphs, such as eigenvalues and closed walks. This is a subfield of graph theory. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper discusses asymptotic expansions and the use of exponential functions, which are topics within numerical analysis. However, this is less likely than cs.GT. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper does not explicitly mention computational geometry, but it does deal with the properties of graphs and their embeddings, which is a topic within computational geometry.
