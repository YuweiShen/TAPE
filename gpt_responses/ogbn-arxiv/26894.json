The system is designed to address the challenges of fuzzy, unstable, and inconsistent preferences and the lack of reasons for the superiority of certain skyline points in a multi-dimensional space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with multi-dimensional data and proposes a system for revealing the superiority of skyline points, which suggests that it could also belong to the Database (cs.DB), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Visualization (cs.VIS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
