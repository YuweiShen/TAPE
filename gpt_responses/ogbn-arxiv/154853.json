Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the potential of exploiting mobility patterns, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The discussion of multi-tier networks and potential sources of improvement at higher layers of the communication protocol hierarchy suggest the categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Finally, the discussion of the Carbon footprint of cellular networks suggests the category of cs.CE (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
