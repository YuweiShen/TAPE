This falls under the domain of mechanism design, which is a subfield of game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper deals with the problem of preemptive scheduling with deadlines, which is a classic problem in the domain of algorithms and data structures. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper is relevant to the domain of cloud computing, which is a subfield of distributed and parallel computing. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses the concept of deadline slackness, which is a parameter that can be learned from data, to design a scheduling mechanism. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the concept of commitment, which is related to the problem of information transmission and storage.
