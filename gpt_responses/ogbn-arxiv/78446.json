It also involves probability and algorithms, which are relevant to the fields of theoretical computer science (cs.FL) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also has applications in synchronization of finite state information sources and splicing systems in computational biology, which could fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
