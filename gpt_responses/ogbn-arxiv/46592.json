Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning models to handle large noise in manipulation demonstrations and learn features from different modalities, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper uses language instructions as one of the modalities, which could also place it in cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
