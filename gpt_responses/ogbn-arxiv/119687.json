It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses the parameterization of equivariant kernels for learning. Additionally, it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it discusses the interpretability of deep networks. The paper also uses Mackey theory, which is a mathematical theory related to group representations, so it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the classification of G-CNNs based on their group of symmetry, base space, and field type, which may make it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
