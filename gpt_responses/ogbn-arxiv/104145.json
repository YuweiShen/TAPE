This makes it likely to belong to the cs.DS sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses a recent XSAT solver as an auxiliary function, which is a common technique in the field of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the problem of exact satisfiability is often studied in the context of artificial intelligence, making it likely to belong to the cs.AI sub-category.\n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper presents upper time bounds for the algorithms proposed, which is a key aspect of computational complexity theory. This makes it likely to belong to the cs.CC sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses a new kind of branching, which is a common technique in machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the problem of exact satisfiability is often studied in the context of machine learning, making it likely to belong to the cs.LG sub-category.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The problem of exact satisfiability is a fundamental problem in discrete mathematics, and the paper presents algorithms for solving it.
