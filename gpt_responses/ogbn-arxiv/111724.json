This topic falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and specifically, the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of specialized accelerators also relates to computer architecture (cs.AR) and embedded systems (cs.ET). The framework's focus on optimizing computation efficiency and energy efficiency suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of clustering methods to optimize the model for in-memory processing aligns with the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
