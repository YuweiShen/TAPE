The use of combinatorial designs and sets is also a common theme in coding theory and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the impact of noise on the performance of self-synchronizing codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents constructions for self-synchronizing codes with high information rates, which is a topic in networking and communication (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
