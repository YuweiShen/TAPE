The paper introduces a logical system for handling stratification, which is a concept related to the complexity of cut-elimination procedures. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses the use of categorical constructions, which is a topic in category theory, suggesting that cs.PL (Programming Languages) is another possible sub-category. The paper also mentions complexity properties, which could place it in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses alternative reformulations of linear logic, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
