The paper proposes a modified decomposition algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. The algorithm involves data structures and techniques commonly used in the areas of data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), graph theory (cs.GT), computational complexity (cs.CC), and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
