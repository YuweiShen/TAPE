Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of the learned arrow of time in measuring reachability, detecting side-effects, and obtaining an intrinsic reward signal, which are topics related to control systems and information theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper presents empirical results on discrete and continuous environments, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
