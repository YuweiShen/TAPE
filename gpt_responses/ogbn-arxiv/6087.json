The use of submodularity in the algorithm suggests that it may also fall under the category of combinatorial optimization (cs.CC). The evaluation of the algorithm on a Bayesian experimental design problem suggests that it may also fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of noisy observations suggests that it may also fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
