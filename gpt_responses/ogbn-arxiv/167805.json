It focuses on improving the performance of network protocols and is likely to be classified under this category. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the design of a QuicSocks proxy that delegates domain name resolution towards the proxy. This involves security considerations such as avoiding IP address spoofing and anticipating Network Address Translators, which could make it relevant to this category. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed solution involves the use of a proxy server to improve the performance of QUIC connections. This could be relevant to the category of distributed computing. \n\n4. cs.DL (Digital Libraries) - This category includes research on information retrieval, which could be relevant to the domain name resolution aspect of the proposed solution. \n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a solution to improve the performance of QUIC connections, which could be relevant to the category of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
