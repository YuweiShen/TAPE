The problem is known to be hard in both the approximation and parameterized settings, indicating that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions kernelization procedures for variants of the problem involving squares, which suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
