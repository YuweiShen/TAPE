The proposed method involves the use of ensembles of networks, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also proposes a new benchmark dataset for the evaluation of multi-lingual scene text end-to-end reading systems, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
