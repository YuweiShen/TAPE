This falls under the categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Computer Communications (cs.COM). The paper specifically focuses on analyzing the uplink spectral efficiencies of different implementations, which involves signal processing and optimization techniques that are commonly studied in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
