This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science subfields, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communication (cs.COM). However, given the focus on CSI acquisition and optimization for MIMO systems, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of linear precoders, which further supports the relevance of cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
