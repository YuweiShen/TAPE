The paper discusses the impact of finite datasets on the training of neural classifiers and provides new bounds on information losses that are less sensitive to input compression and in general much smaller than existing bounds. Given the focus on machine learning and neural networks, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, the paper also deals with information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE), which are all relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
