It also involves the use of deep learning models such as Faster RCNN and YOLO, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques to construct the adversarial examples. \n\nAs the paper involves the evaluation of the effectiveness of the adversarial examples, it is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nSince the paper discusses the potential security hazards that could arise from the use of adversarial examples, it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. \n\nFinally, as the paper involves the use of smart vehicles, it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
