This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with detecting hidden messages in images. Additionally, steganography techniques often involve manipulating multimedia data, which could also place this paper in the categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of machine learning and statistical analysis in steganalysis could also place this paper in the categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
