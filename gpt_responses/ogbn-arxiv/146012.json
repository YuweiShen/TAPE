This involves generating attention maps from features at multiple resolutions with various semantics, modeling correlations among neighboring regions in the attention map using Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and combining holistic attention and body part attention models. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE) research, particularly in the context of object detection and recognition. Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on two widely used human pose estimation benchmarks, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
