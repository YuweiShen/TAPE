The Web of Data also involves the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to traverse and analyze the data. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the Web of Data can be searched and queried. Additionally, the paper mentions the interlinking relationships between RDF data sets, which is a topic related to social networks and social media (cs.SI). Finally, the use of directed graphs for analysis is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
