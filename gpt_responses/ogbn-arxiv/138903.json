This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics (cs.DM), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and theoretical computer science (cs.TC). The paper also involves graph theory and combinatorics, which are relevant to the categories of discrete mathematics (cs.DM), theoretical computer science (cs.TC), and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper may also involve complexity theory (cs.CC) as the \\v{C}erny conjecture is a longstanding open problem in the field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
