The focus on interaction with human students suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of an overseeing AI system and the need for verification suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the use of artificial agents in education may also fall under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
