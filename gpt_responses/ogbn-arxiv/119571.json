The paper also discusses the classification of different LFM approaches, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions cost-effectiveness as a driving force for the deployment of LFM, which could relate to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
