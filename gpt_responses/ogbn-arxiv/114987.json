The paper also proposes two sampling strategies to generate unlabelled sets of points, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper validates the proposed strategies in six well-known problems, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), or data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
