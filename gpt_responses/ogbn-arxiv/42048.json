This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). The investigation involves analyzing the behavior of CPU registers, cache, and shared memory, which could also fall under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper explores the use of PUFs in GPUs, which could be categorized under cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
