The two sequential learning tasks discussed in the paper are related to regret minimization and best arm identification, which are common topics in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the complexity terms associated with the problems, which is related to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses the learning process and optimization, which are related to the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.DS, cs.IT, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
