It involves adapting the weights of an acoustic model using a meta-learning approach. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in sub-categories such as cs.SD (Sound), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves adapting to unseen speakers, which could place it in the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
