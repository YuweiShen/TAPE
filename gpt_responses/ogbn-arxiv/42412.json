This involves supervised training of the network architecture on data extracted from numerical simulations of a physics-based model, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of FCNs for classification also involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed approach to real-life cases, which falls under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
