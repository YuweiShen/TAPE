The proposed method is based on applying the Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE), which is a statistical technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper mentions connections between the proposed method and LASSO, which is a popular method in statistics and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
