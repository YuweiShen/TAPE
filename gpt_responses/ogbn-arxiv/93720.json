The paper proposes a new method for learning state representations by maximizing mutual information across spatially and temporally distinct features of a neural encoder of the observations. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
