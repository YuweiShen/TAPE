The proposed approach involves learning a mapping from a semantic-descriptor space to an image-feature space, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for feature extraction and representation learning. The paper also discusses domain adaptation and calibration, which are topics commonly studied in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
