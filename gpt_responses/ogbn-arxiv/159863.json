The use of non-convex approximations is a novel approach to solving this problem, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes an algorithmic improvement to the standard approach, which could fall under Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). The use of zone graphs and region closures also suggests a connection to the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
