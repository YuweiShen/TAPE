This is a topic that falls under the purview of information theory, making cs.IT the most likely sub-category.\n\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the construction of WOM codes based on finite Euclidean geometries over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which involves the use of mathematical structures to encode information. This is a topic that is closely related to data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper analyzes methods of adapting binary WOM codes for use on multilevel flash cells, which involves the use of parallel and distributed computing techniques to improve the performance of the codes. This is a topic that falls under the purview of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing, making cs.DC a likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper deals with the design and application of WOM codes for flash memory storage, which involves the use of hardware architectures to implement the codes.
