It involves the use of Proof-of-Stake consensus and introduces the concept of prestige as a volatile resource that can be gained by performing useful work. The paper also discusses the resistance of the system against Sybil and Collude attacks. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
