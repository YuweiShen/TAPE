The proposed model involves sequential modeling, which is a popular topic in the machine learning community. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves personalized memorization, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and recommender systems (cs.AI). The model also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with user behavior logs.
