The use of rank-metric codes is a key aspect of the proposed scheme, which is a topic of interest in both coding theory (cs.IT) and algebraic geometry (cs.AG). The paper also discusses the scenario where the network may suffer from a rank deficiency, which is a topic of interest in network information theory (cs.NI) and communication complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes a universal coding scheme that can be applied on top of any communication network, which is a topic of interest in system and network architecture (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
