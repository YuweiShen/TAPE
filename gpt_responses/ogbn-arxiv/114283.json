The framework uses a specialized L1 regularized Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) survival model and a generalized linear model (GLM) for prediction. This suggests that the paper involves machine learning techniques.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of EMR data to analyze outcomes in patients, which has implications for healthcare and society. The paper also highlights the importance of scalable and efficient utilization of data available in EMRs, which can benefit healthcare providers and patients. This suggests that the paper involves issues related to computers and society.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper involves the analysis of a large corpus of EMR data to uncover important factors influencing outcomes in patients. This suggests that the paper involves database techniques for handling and analyzing large datasets.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing EMR data to uncover important factors influencing outcomes in patients. This suggests that the paper involves artificial intelligence techniques for analyzing and predicting outcomes.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the importance of efficient and scalable utilization of data available in EMRs, which can benefit healthcare providers and patients.
