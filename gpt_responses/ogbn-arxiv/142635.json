Additionally, the experiments are conducted on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a likely sub-category. The use of a small candidate operation pool and progressive pruning and replacement of candidates suggests that this paper could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the focus on optimizing the search space suggests that this paper could also be relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
