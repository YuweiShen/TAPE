The proposed algorithm BIHL uses machine learning techniques to generate candidate boxes, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the algorithm, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
