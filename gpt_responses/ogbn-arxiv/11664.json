The paper also mentions the use of digital media files, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The utilization of network protocols as a carrier suggests the involvement of information theory, making cs.IT a possible category. The paper also mentions the use of steganography in image and video processing, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision).
