The use of multiple modalities and fusion techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. The paper also addresses bias in face recognition systems, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed multi-modal fusion method involves machine learning techniques, which could place the paper in the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
