This suggests that the paper may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing category. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design and development of a P2P Presentation System for live streaming of lectures, which involves video streaming and the use of a shareable whiteboard. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture category. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a P2P Presentation System for live streaming of lectures, which involves video streaming and the use of a shareable whiteboard. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Multimedia category. \n\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the use of a whiteboard for graphic illustrations during the lecture, which may involve natural language processing techniques. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computation and Language category. \n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the design and development of a P2P Presentation System for e-learning, which may have implications for the use of technology in education and society. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computers and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
