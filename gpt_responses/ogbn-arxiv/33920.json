The use of contextual cues and structured-output surrogate loss suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The use of a large dataset of movie frames suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) techniques. Finally, the evaluation of the method against several recent baselines suggests the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
