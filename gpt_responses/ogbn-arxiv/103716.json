The proposed framework involves active testing, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to efficiently query a user for accurate performance estimates. The paper also mentions multi-label classification (cs.CL) and instance segmentation (cs.MM) as two popular computer vision tasks for which the proposed framework is effective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
