It also discusses the use of channel codes such as LDPC and turbo codes, which are commonly studied in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also presents an algorithmic approach to the problem, which could fall under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of CRC symbols, which are commonly used in error detection and correction (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the design of constructive schemes for non-binary and binary sources, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
