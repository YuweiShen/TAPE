The navigation system is based on vision, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, which is a common approach in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of numerical optimization, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
