The paper specifically focuses on the decoding process of NMT models, which involves generating the target sequence based on the source sequence and the learned translation model. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a new NMT model that uses structural prediction of the target-side context to guide the decoding process. This involves predicting the complex structure of the target sequence and using it to generate the translation, which requires a deep understanding of the language and its syntax. This suggests that the paper is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe proposed model uses deconvolutional neural networks (DeconvNets) to perform the structural prediction, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is commonly used in computer vision tasks. This suggests that the paper is also likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper uses experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which involves analyzing the performance of the model on different types of sentences and comparing it to state-of-the-art methods.
