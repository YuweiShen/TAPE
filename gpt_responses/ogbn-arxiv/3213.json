The paper also discusses techniques for improving the accuracy of the model, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of UAVs for wildlife monitoring is a topic in robotics (cs.RO) and the paper discusses the challenges of processing large datasets, which is related to computer networks and communications (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
