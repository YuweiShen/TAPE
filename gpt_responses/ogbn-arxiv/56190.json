This falls under the category of system control (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of black-box optimization methods such as CMA-ES, which is a popular method in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The use of CMA-ES also involves the adaptation of the covariance matrix, which is a common technique in neural network training (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of the optimization method in simulation software, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
