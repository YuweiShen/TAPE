The paper specifically addresses the issue of obstacle shadowing in urban environments, which is a security concern (cs.CR) and also involves the use of cloud-based techniques (cs.DC). The paper proposes a hybrid approach that involves both vehicular cloud and multi-hop techniques, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves simulation-based performance analysis, which is a common approach in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
