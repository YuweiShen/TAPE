The paper also discusses the number of morphing steps required for different types of graphs, which falls under the category of graph algorithms (cs.DM) and graph drawing (cs.GR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of linear programming and integer programming, which are optimization techniques commonly used in computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
