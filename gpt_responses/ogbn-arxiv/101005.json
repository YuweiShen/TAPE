The paper focuses on computer vision and image processing, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) category. Additionally, the paper uses ResNet, a popular deep learning architecture, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The paper also discusses the use of regression layers and proposal mechanisms, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper evaluates its approach on the ICDAR2013 dataset, which is a common benchmark for text detection, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category. Finally, the paper deals with text detection, which is a common task in natural language processing, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
