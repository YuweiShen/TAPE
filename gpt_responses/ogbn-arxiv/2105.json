This involves learning representations from large-sized PGPMs and modulating them in an interactive visual interface. The paper involves machine learning, computer vision, and interactive systems, which are all relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
