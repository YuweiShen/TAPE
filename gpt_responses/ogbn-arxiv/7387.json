It could also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it discusses the performance of state-of-the-art models. Additionally, it could be classified under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with human-like cognitive processes such as category membership. The paper also involves crowdsourcing, which could place it under the sub-category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of improved graded LE systems, which could place it under Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
