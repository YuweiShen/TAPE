This involves using label-text as input for the corresponding label-index. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on a specific low-resource biomedical task called PICO annotation. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
