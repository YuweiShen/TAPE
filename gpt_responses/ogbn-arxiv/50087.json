The paper also analyzes the combinatorial complexity of the diagram, which falls under the cs.DS sub-category. The paper also discusses the iterative approach to construct the diagram, which is related to the cs.DM sub-category. The paper also considers the $L_p$ metric, which is relevant to the cs.GR sub-category.
