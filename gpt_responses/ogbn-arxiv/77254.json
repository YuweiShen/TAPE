This involves designing a robust beamforming scheme that maximizes the detection probability of the radar while meeting the performance requirements of the communication system. The problem involves optimization and signal processing techniques, which are typically covered in the Information Theory (cs.IT), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. However, since the paper focuses on the interaction between wireless communication and radar systems, the RF and Microwave Engineering (cs.RF) sub-category is also a likely fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
