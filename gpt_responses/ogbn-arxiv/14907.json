This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer security (cs.CR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses extensions for power and thermal management, which could fall under the computer architecture (cs.AR) and electronic devices and circuits (cs.ET) sub-categories, respectively. The paper also mentions the specifics of material and structural properties in 3D ICs, which could be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes an open-source tool to mitigate SCAs, which could fall under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
