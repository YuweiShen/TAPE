This involves exploring the inherent relevance of different layers to the final decision, the incentives of higher-level features to lower-level features, and the characteristics of different backbone networks in the mining of basic features and the correlation utilization of convolutional channels. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper also deals with the problem of object detection, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper uses remote sensing data from Google Earth, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
