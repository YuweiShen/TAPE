The proposed approach involves projecting label embeddings into a low-dimensional space, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves incorporating auxiliary information to guide the label embedding projection, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on image classification tasks, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
