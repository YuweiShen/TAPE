This involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI) to optimize the use of available spectrum. The paper also discusses the use of Golay-Davis-Jedwab (GDJ) sequences, which are commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper presents upper bounds on the PMEPR of the proposed preamble sequences, which involves mathematical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
