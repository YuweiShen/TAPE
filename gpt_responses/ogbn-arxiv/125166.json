The approach described in the paper involves using probabilities to track the flow of proof through the theory, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the convergence of the approach and its experimental results, which are topics of interest in cryptography (cs.CR) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
