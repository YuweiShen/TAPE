The use of fast rectangular matrix multiplication suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG), while the focus on all-pairs shortest paths and matrix multiplication suggests connections to data structures (cs.DS), complexity theory (cs.CC), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of Boolean matrices and the (min,max)-product problem suggests a connection to logic and automata theory (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
