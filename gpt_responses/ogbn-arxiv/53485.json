The paper presents a stochastic optimization algorithm for solving the empirical objective of CCA, which is of interest to the machine learning community. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.STAT (Statistics) are the most likely categories. The paper also involves some techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS) for efficient computation. Finally, the paper presents a streaming algorithm for CCA, which is of interest to the database community and falls under the category of cs.ML (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
