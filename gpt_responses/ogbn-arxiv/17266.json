However, the focus on adaptive training set formation and the overview of available algorithms suggest that the paper is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the adaptivity mechanisms and principle mechanisms of concept drift learners, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data mining (cs.DM). The paper may also be relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI) and computer vision (cs.CV), as concept drift can occur in these fields as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
