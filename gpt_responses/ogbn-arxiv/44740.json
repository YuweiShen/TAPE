The mention of applications in secret sharing schemes suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR) and security (cs.SI). The use of defining sets in constructing the codes may also relate to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper does not seem to involve algorithms or complexity theory, so categories such as cs.DS or cs.CC may be less likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
