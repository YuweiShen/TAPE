Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which covers topics related to DNNs and their optimization. The paper also discusses the performance and accuracy of the DNNs, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as well. Additionally, the experiments involve image classification tasks, which could place the paper in cs.CV (Computer Vision). The methodology proposed in the paper involves automatic selection of activation functions, which could also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
