This topic is closely related to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE), as well as computer architecture (cs.AR) and distributed computing (cs.DC) since array-intensive programs can be parallelized across multiple machines. Additionally, the paper may also touch on logic (cs.LO) since functional verification involves reasoning about program correctness."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
