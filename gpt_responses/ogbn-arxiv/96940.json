Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory) as the paper discusses exploiting the sparse nature of the mmWave propagation channel to estimate both the angle of departures (AoDs) and the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the mmWave channel. \n\nThe paper also discusses localization, which suggests it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as localization is a crucial aspect of wireless networks. \n\nThe paper also discusses enhancing the performance of mmWave beamforming, which could suggest it belongs to cs.SI (Signal Processing) as beamforming is a signal processing technique. \n\nThe paper specifically focuses on millimeter wave communication systems, which could suggest it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia) as millimeter wave communication is a key technology for multimedia applications. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed technique compared to conventional techniques, which could suggest it belongs to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it discusses the performance of a system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
