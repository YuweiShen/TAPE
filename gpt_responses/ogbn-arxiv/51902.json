Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the numerical performance of various algorithms, which falls under cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the paper uses novel discrete Ingham inequalities, which is a topic in harmonic analysis and falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
