This is a security and privacy-related problem, and hence, cs.CR is the most likely category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Decision trees are a popular machine learning model, and the paper discusses a privacy-preserving protocol for evaluating decision trees. Hence, cs.LG is a likely category.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a novel client-server protocol that delegates the complete tree evaluation to the server while preserving privacy and reducing the overhead. This involves the use of efficient data representations and algorithmic optimizations, which are related to data structures and algorithms. Hence, cs.DS is a likely category.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the use of fully (somewhat) homomorphic encryption and algorithmic optimizations to keep the computational overhead and the communication cost low. This involves analyzing the computational complexity of the proposed scheme, which is related to cs.CC.\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper deals with the problem of preserving the privacy of both the decision tree and the client input, which has implications for society and privacy.
