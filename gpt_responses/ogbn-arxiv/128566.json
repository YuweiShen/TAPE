This involves processing raw sensory inputs such as images and depth maps, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The focus on control of robots and autonomous systems suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of supervised learning and neural networks suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
