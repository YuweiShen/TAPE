The introduction of a novel metric between Markov Decision Processes and the establishment of Lipschitz continuity of optimal value functions with respect to the task space suggest that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of RL also suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the focus on Lifelong Learning suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.LO (Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
