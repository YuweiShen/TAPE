The use of the adaptive interpolation method suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of signal processing (cs.SI) and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the dense graph regime mentioned in the abstract may indicate a connection to the field of statistical physics (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
