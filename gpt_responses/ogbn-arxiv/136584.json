This approach is intended for use in asynchronous multi-context systems (aMCSs), which involve processing data streams from external sources and other contexts. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under several sub-categories, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for the use of answer-set programming, machine learning (cs.LG) for the processing of data streams, databases (cs.DB) for the management of incoming data, software engineering (cs.SE) for the coordination of multiple input streams, and programming languages (cs.PL) for the use of declarative programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
