Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of the OIE corpus for downstream tasks such as knowledge base construction and open question answering, which are relevant to the sub-fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper compares the OIE corpus to existing knowledge bases such as DBpedia, which falls under the sub-field of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
