This involves optimizing the transmission of information over a shared channel, which falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on video transmission and the perceived quality of users, which is a key aspect of multimedia systems. The proposed framework integrates a quality model for encoded video with the physical layer model for NOMA transmission, which is relevant to multimedia systems.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with multi-user NOMA system design for video transmission, which involves networking and internet architecture aspects such as resource allocation and user grouping.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although not directly related to the paper, the use of machine learning and neural networks for video quality assessment is a growing area of research in multimedia systems.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a cross-layer support framework for multi-user NOMA-based video transmission, which involves coordination and control of different layers in the system. This falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
