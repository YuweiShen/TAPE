The implementation of these techniques in Maple also suggests a focus on numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also mentions tools for visualizing the cuts, which could be related to computer graphics (cs.CG). Finally, the use of inverse trigonometric functions and other mathematical functions suggests a possible connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
