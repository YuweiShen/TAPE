The paper also mentions the integration of the analysis into a general framework for resource analysis of programs, which is a common topic in the programming languages community. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses an annotated type system to establish the resource analysis, which is a common technique in the area of type systems and logic in computer science. The paper also mentions the use of polynomial bounds on the innermost runtime complexity, which is a topic of interest in the analysis of logic programs. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the analysis of term rewrite systems, which can be seen as a form of algorithmic specification. The paper also mentions the use of user-defined inductive data-types, which are a common topic in the area of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with the analysis of term rewrite systems, which are a fundamental concept in the theory of formal languages and automata. The paper also mentions the use of polynomial bounds on the innermost runtime complexity, which is a topic of interest in the analysis of formal language and automata models. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents an"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
