This topic is closely related to the fields of data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of probabilistic methods. Additionally, the paper mentions the need for real-time recording and estimation of stream information, which could fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
