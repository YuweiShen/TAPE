Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is a popular method in machine learning and falls under cs.MM (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the psychological aspect of emotional reactions, which could fall under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also mentions the use of hand-tuned features and benchmarking analyses, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
