This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the practical implementation of these codes and decoding methods, which could fall under networked systems (cs.NI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). The analysis of the exchange of limits could also fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
