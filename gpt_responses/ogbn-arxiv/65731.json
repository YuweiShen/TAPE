Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The proposed framework also involves novel techniques and normalization schemes, which suggests that it may fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses two challenging iris databases, which may indicate that it could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
