The method involves a module that facilitates information exchange among neighboring frames, which can be seen as a form of memory modeling (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the performance and efficiency trade-off, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method involves deep learning techniques, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of online setting for real-time video recognition, which can be seen as a form of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
