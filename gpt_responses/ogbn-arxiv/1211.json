This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are covered by cs.CL and cs.IR respectively. The use of reinforcement learning also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (AI), which is covered by cs.AI. The approach involves learning a policy to dynamically decide which sub-question to answer, which involves balancing between risk and utility. This suggests a focus on machine learning (ML) and decision making, which are covered by cs.LG and cs.SD respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
