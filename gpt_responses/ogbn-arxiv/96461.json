The paper also discusses the use of Lidars for navigation and planning algorithms, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The implementation of a supervisor to dictate switching between local navigation routines suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Lastly, the use of a planner to calculate the path along the bridge surface suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
