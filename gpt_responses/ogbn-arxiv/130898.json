The model takes both acoustic and semantic representations of speech as input, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The model is also based on deep learning (cs.AI) and involves subjective and objective evaluations (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
