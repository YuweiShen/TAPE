The use of curvature information and normal variation suggests a focus on computational geometry (cs.CG). The evaluation of the approach on clean and real-world models suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of a Shannon entropy model suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
