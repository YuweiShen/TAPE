The paper also discusses the asymptotic behavior of the instantaneous capacity, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the impact of spatial correlation and power imbalance on the outage capacity of MIMO channels, which is relevant to the design and optimization of wireless networks. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the impact of spatial correlation and power imbalance on the outage capacity of MIMO channels, which is relevant to the analysis of communication networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the analysis of MIMO channels, which is relevant to the transmission of multimedia content over wireless networks. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not directly relate to this sub-category, but it is possible that the results of the paper could have implications for the design and regulation of wireless communication systems, which could be relevant to the social impact of technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
