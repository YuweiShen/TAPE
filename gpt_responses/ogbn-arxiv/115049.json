The paper deals with a question answering task on instructional videos, specifically screencast tutorial videos pertaining to an image editing program. This involves natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to identify a span of a video segment as an answer. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of video transcripts, which falls under the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the task involves identifying instructional details with various granularities, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
