This is a common topic in social and information networks. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes an efficient approach of selectively enhancing the message-processing capability of a small fraction of the nodes to control traffic congestion, which is a topic in systems and control. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper uses numerical and analytical methods to study the interplay between the creation rate and the delivering rate in determining non-congested or congested traffic in a network, which is a topic in computational engineering. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the message or packet creation and delivering rates at a node, which is a topic in distributed, parallel, and cluster computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
