The use of polynomial-time computability suggests that the paper may belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The study of function spaces and their properties also suggests that the paper may belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of integration and Sobolev spaces suggests that the paper may belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The study of minimality conditions suggests that the paper may belong to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. Finally, the use of quantitative versions of the Arzel\\`a-Ascoli and Fr\\'echet-Kolmogorov Theorems suggests that the paper may belong to the mathematical software (cs.MS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
