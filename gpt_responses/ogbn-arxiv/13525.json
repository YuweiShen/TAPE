The paper also discusses the use of the logic in formal verification techniques such as model checking, which is a topic that falls under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), which is a topic that falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI).
