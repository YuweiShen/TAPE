This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper simulates practical mmWave cellular networks to evaluate the system throughput. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the use of low resolution ADCs in mmWave communication systems, which are often used for multimedia applications such as high-speed data transfer and video streaming.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of adaptive threshold receivers in mmWave communication systems, which can be seen as a control system for optimizing the receiver performance.\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): While the paper does not directly address societal issues related to computing, it is possible that the use of low resolution ADCs in mmWave communication systems could have implications for access to high-speed internet in underserved areas, which falls under the domain of computers and society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
