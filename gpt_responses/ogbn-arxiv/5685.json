The paper also discusses the use of binary representations in image retrieval (cs.IR) and object detection (cs.MM), which are both relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for learning binary representations, which could be considered a contribution to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
