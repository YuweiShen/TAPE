The use of a Markov model and the analysis of long-term average rate suggest a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). The proposal of an online coded caching scheme and the simulation results indicate a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the comparison with the popular LRU caching algorithm suggests a potential interest in performance evaluation and optimization (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
