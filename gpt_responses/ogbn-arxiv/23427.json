The use of graphs and networks in the game also suggests a possible fit in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The study of equilibria and optimization in the game may also make it relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-categories.
