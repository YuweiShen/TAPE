The use of set-membership filtering and reduced-rank joint iterative optimization also suggests that it may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper may also be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as beamforming is used in wireless communication networks. Finally, the use of a time-varying bound to update the beamforming parameters suggests that the paper may be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
