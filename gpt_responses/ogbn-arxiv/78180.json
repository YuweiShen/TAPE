The use of $\\ell_1$ minimization also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of \"optimality\" in the title suggests a focus on numerical analysis (cs.NA), and the use of \"basis pursuit denoising\" suggests a connection to mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
