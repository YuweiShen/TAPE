This is a machine learning problem and falls under the scope of cs.LG. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the problem of image classification where images are pre-segmented into smaller regions. This is a computer vision problem and falls under the scope of cs.CV. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning approach for classification, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the classification of pieces of mail containing several pages, which involves natural language processing and falls under the scope of cs.CL. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a variant of the RBM for classification, which is a neural network model.
