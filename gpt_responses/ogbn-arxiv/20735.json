The paper also discusses different decoding structures and characterizes the Pareto boundary, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas and beamforming also relates to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
