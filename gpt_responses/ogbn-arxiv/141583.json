This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories, as it presents a practical method for securely sharing the modification rule between the legitimate partners and analyzes the secrecy outage probability in a quasi-static fading channel."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
