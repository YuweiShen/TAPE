The pipeline uses a hybrid decision forest method to extract landmarks and probabilistic segmentation maps from both long- and short-axis images to perform quality checks. This involves computer vision and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the computer science sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
