It also involves training a neural network to infer reward functions from limited demonstrations, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the problem of specifying reward functions for reinforcement learning agents. \n\nThe paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it discusses the practical challenges of applying reinforcement learning in the real world, where robots must interact with their environment. The use of images as input to infer reward functions suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with the problem of controlling agents to achieve a desired goal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
