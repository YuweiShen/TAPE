Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DL (Machine Learning). The use of synthetic energy maps and the watershed transform could also place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with processing full pages of written music, which could suggest a connection to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
