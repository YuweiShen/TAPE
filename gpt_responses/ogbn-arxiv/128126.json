The paper also mentions the use of neural networks in computer vision tasks (cs.CV) and the optimization of network parameters (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a composite neural network, which involves combining multiple pre-trained models, which could be relevant to the systems and control field (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
