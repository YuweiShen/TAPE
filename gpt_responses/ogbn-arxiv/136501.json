The paper also proposes a novel approach to weakly supervised learning, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of bounding box detection annotations and convolutional neural networks (convnets) also suggests that the paper may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
