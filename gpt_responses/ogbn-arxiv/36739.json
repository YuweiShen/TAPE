The use of soft predicates for collision detection involves artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI) and the experiments involve computer vision (cs.CV) for analyzing the performance of the algorithms. The paper also mentions the use of decomposition techniques, which is a common approach in control systems (cs.SY) and computational geometry (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
