The method is applicable to classifiers from any model class, making it relevant to a wide range of sub-categories. The use of neural networks is mentioned, suggesting relevance to sub-categories such as cs.LG and cs.NE. The experiments involve datasets and classifiers related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), indicating relevance to those sub-categories. The paper also discusses measures such as log-loss and Brier score, which are commonly used in the evaluation of machine learning models, suggesting relevance to sub-categories such as cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
