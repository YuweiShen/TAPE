The measuring system used in the paper is composed of standard comparator indicators, which are commonly used in mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The calibration algorithm developed in the paper involves estimating joint offsets and leg lengths, which are parameters related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses experimental results, which may involve image processing and computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the Orthoglide family of parallel kinematic mechanisms, which is a specific topic related to robotics and control systems (cs.ROB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
