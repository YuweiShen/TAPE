The proposed probabilistic model takes into account workers' attention to estimate the label quality, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also mentions the need to maintain the quality of annotated data, which relates to computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses experiments on real-world datasets, which suggests a cybersecurity (cs.CY) aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
