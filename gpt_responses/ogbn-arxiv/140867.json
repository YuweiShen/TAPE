The paper proposes a new gradient estimator for Monte Carlo objectives, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses applications of the proposed estimator in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural engineering (cs.NE), which are related to machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the estimator in variational inference (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY), which are also relevant to machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
