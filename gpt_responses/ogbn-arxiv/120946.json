Additionally, the paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it analyses the activation of kernels in convolutional layers of the networks. The paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it studies the performance of different networks with distinct architectures. Furthermore, the paper may be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it investigates the mechanisms of deep neural networks in processing visual information. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it discusses the similarities between the mechanisms of DNNs and biological visual systems, which may have implications for understanding natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
