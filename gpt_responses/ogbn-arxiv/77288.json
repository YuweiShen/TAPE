The paper also proposes a data-driven framework for analyzing the vulnerability of classifiers, which involves exploring and exploiting the classifier's behavior, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework on real-world datasets, which is a common practice in the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
