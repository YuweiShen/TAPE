The analysis involves the scaling of parameters with increasing network size, which is a common theme in the field of scalable algorithms and data structures (cs.SI). The paper also characterizes the asymptotic distribution of decoding delay, which is a topic in the field of probability and statistics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of the results to other coding schemes, which involves the study of coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
