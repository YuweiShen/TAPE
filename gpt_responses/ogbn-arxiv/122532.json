The use of a trainable synthesizer network and adversarial training also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The introduction of blending artefacts to make the target classifier invariant to them suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of object detection networks suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
