The paper also describes the use of these devices in a neural network architecture, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the design of the circuit and algorithm, which could fall under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and electromagnetics (cs.EM).
