The paper also discusses the application of compressed sensing to super-resolution problems, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for joint sparse signal recovery and parameter estimation, which can be considered as a sub-topic of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
