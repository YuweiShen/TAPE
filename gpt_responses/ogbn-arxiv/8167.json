This involves developing a network that assigns pseudo labels to images in the unlabeled target domain while the third branch is trained with supervision based on images in the pseudo-labeled target domain. The paper focuses on large-scale domain adaptation experiments using both synthetic (GTA) and real (Cityscapes) images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves training the network with supervision, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves experiments with large-scale datasets, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
