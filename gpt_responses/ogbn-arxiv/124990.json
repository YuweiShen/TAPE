The proposed method involves designing a two-stream network that consists of a main full image stream and a densely semantically-aligned guiding stream. The paper also achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper addresses issues related to occlusion and imperfect person detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
