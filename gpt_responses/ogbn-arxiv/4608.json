The paper also presents experiments using both shallow and deep approaches for classification. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category.
