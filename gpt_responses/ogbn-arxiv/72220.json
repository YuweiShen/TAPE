The proposed approach uses deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, to detect injected data measurement, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach also observes both data measurements and network level features to jointly learn system states, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of deep learning also suggests the possibility of neural networks (cs.NE) being used in the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
