The target users are computer vision researchers who wish to collect hyper-realistic computer-generated imagery of a city from the street level, under controlled 6DOF camera poses and varying environmental conditions. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions generating a large-scale dataset with groundtruth camera poses for testing structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithms, which falls under cs.GR (Graphics). Additionally, the paper involves manipulating conditions of the virtual environment on the fly, which could be categorized under cs.GT (Computer Graphics). The paper also mentions automatic screen capture, which could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper mentions generating 3D point clouds, which could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
