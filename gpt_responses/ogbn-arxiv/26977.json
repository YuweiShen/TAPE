The paper's discussion on approximation bounds for deep networks could be relevant to this sub-category. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Deep learning is a subfield of AI, and the paper's focus on deep network approximation could be relevant to this sub-category. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): While less likely, the paper's discussion on deep network architectures could be relevant to the study of social networks and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
