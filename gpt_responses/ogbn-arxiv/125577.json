The use of neural networks in this work suggests that it may fall under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of side constraints and cache-based models suggests that it may also fall under the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG).
