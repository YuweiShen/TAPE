The paper also discusses the application of these methods to image recognition tasks (cs.CV) and mentions the use of boosting algorithms (cs.AI) and normalization techniques (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves the manipulation of data at each layer of the neural network, which could potentially fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
