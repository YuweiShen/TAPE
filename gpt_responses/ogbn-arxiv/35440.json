The use of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas to specify high-level mission requirements suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The optimization aspect of the problem and the use of bounds on deviation from optimal values suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.MA) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
