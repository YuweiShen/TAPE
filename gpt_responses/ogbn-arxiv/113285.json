It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a new selection scheme for optimization. Additionally, it could be classified under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with optimization techniques. The paper also involves data structures (cs.DS) as it discusses the genetic diversity of populations.
