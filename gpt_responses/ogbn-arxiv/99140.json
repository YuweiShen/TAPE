The paper also focuses on improving the non-linearity of GCNs, which is relevant to research on neural networks and deep learning (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on tasks such as node classification and link prediction, which are common in natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL) as well as computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
