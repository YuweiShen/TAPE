The paper also proposes a convex feasibility program to solve the problem, which involves optimization techniques and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also introduces novel interpolating polynomials, which are a mathematical tool used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper discusses stability of the algorithm to model mismatch and additive noise, which are topics in statistical inference and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper applies the algorithm to the case of a Gaussian point spread function, which is a common model in image processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
