The protocol involves dynamic model averaging, which involves communication between distributed data sources, making it relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the ability to quickly adapt to concept drifts, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
