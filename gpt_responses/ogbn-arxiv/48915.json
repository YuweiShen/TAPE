The paper also focuses on the impact of array aperture, which is related to antenna design and signal processing (cs.MM). The study involves multiple users and antennas, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the propagation conditions where line-of-sight is dominant, which is related to the field of computer architecture and robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
