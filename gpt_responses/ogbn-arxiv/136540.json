The codes are also designed to have low repair locality, which is a concept related to distributed storage (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses metrics such as storage overhead and repair bandwidth, which are commonly used in performance analysis of distributed systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses optimization techniques to search for codes with desirable properties, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
