The paper also focuses on the convergence time of the inter-domain routing (IDR) protocol, which suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a centralized routing decision process, which could fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also discusses the lack of an easy-to-use public tool for hybrid SDN and BGP experimentation, which could suggest that it belongs to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the effect of the proposed approach on IDR convergence time, which could suggest that it belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
