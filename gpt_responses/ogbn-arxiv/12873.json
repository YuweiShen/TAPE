The use of machine learning techniques such as conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAE) and the evaluation of performance gains over heuristics and learned baselines suggest that the paper also belongs to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of obstacle configurations, which suggests that it may belong to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of generating roadmaps, which is a fundamental problem in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
