The use of autonomous control and the evaluation of safety conditions suggest the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of tactile terrain exploration by a body-mounted robotic arm suggests the use of computer vision (cs.CV). The evaluation of safety conditions also suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of incomplete data and the need to marginalize control suggest the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
