This involves analyzing the pairwise relationships between parts of objects and encoding this information in a latent space. Given this, the model can generate new 3D shapes that have similar structure and geometry to the input objects. This work involves computer vision (3D shape modeling), graphics (generative models), machine learning (autoencoders), and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.GR (Computer Graphics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
