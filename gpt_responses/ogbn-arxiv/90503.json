The use of deep object recognition networks also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed approach in image storage and sharing, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
