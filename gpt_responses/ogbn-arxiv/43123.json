It could also belong to cs.SD (Sound) as it deals with speech data. Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on cross-domain scenarios suggests it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
