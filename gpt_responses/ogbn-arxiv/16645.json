This involves using neural network modules to represent the compatibility between input images and concepts, and reweighting these modules to generalize to unseen categories. Given this focus on computer vision and machine learning, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
