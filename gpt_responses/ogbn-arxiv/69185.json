The paper derives achievable rate-equivocation pairs for the proposed secure coding schemes, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with the problem of secure coding design for a wiretap channel, which is a fundamental problem in cryptography and security. The paper proposes a new secure error-correcting code for a type II wiretap channel and derives achievable rate-equivocation pairs for the proposed coding schemes. \n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the proposed secure coding schemes may have implications for the computational complexity of decoding the codes. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not explicitly deal with social and information networks, but the proposed secure coding schemes may have implications for the security of information networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the proposed secure coding schemes may have implications for the security of multimedia transmission over wiretap channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
