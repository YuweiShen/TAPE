The use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) also suggests a focus on network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for detection, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The design and evaluation of a proof-of-concept system suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of SDN for network management and security is a topic of interest in the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
