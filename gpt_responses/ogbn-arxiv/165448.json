Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also utilizes deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves feature extraction and normalization, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also aims to improve the discriminative capacity of video representations, which could be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on two datasets, which could be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
