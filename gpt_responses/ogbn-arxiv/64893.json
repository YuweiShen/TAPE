The paper proposes a modified version of IMPALA, which is a popular scalable RL algorithm. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also evaluates the proposed algorithm on discrete and continuous control environments, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
