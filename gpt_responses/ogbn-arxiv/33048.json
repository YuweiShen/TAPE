Hence, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel loss function to handle heterogeneity in data, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). The paper also deals with natural language processing (NLP) as it discusses the use of ensemble strategy, which is a common technique in NLP (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with neural networks, which falls under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
