This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as it deals with automated decision tools. The paper also mentions network topologies, which suggests that it may belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories.
