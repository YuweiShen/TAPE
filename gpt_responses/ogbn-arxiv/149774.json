The paper proposes a new framework for obtaining globally optimal solutions to weighted sum-rate maximization problems, which involves exploiting the achievable rate region and monotonic optimization techniques. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with multiple-antenna systems, which could place it in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) or Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes algorithms and techniques for solving the optimization problems, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
