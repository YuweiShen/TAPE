This involves processing matching scores across all candidate matches at all locations, which is a common task in computer vision and falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method is also designed for use in robots and autonomous vehicles, which suggests that it may be relevant to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of convolutional operations in the network architecture, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and specifically in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
