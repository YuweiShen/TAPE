The focus of the paper is on the quality of predictive uncertainty estimates for BNNs, which suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with regression and classification tasks, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses inference methods, which are relevant to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the structure in the posterior, which is relevant to the sub-categories of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
