The paper focuses on the collaborative assembly of furniture, which is a common scenario in HRC, and aims to reduce the amount of work required to set up and reproduce HRC experiments, providing a unified framework to facilitate the comparison and integration of contributions to the field. The paper also provides a set of software libraries for perception, control, and interaction, which are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.RO and cs.HC, followed by cs.AI, cs.SY, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
