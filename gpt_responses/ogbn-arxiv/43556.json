It also involves statistical techniques (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) for clustering and concept drift detection. Information retrieval (cs.IR) could also be a possible sub-category as the paper deals with organizing and categorizing video data. Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques (cs.SD) for energy minimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
