The paper proposes a new objective for this task, which is based on contrastive learning. This objective is shown to outperform existing methods on a variety of knowledge transfer tasks. Given this focus, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with natural language processing tasks, which suggests cs.CL (Computation and Language) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper uses neural networks, which suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
