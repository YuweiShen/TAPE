The use of mutual information and statistical distance also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the distinction between information theoretically secure encryptions and computationally secure ones, which could fall under the categories of complexity theory (cs.CC) or computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis to compare and clarify different definitions of perfect secrecy, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
