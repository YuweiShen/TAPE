The proposed method involves the use of Markov chains, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also discusses statistical hypothesis testing, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed method involves learning from a single sequence for each known gallery object, which is a common technique in transfer learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a novel recognition method, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
