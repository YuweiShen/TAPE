It also involves designing a procedure to estimate sparsity without assuming sparsity, which is a problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of deconvolution-based methods suggests a signal processing (cs.SP) aspect to the work. The analysis of randomized measurements is a numerical analysis (cs.NA) technique. Finally, the use of entropy-based sparsity measures suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
