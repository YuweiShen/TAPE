The use of adversarial training and the focus on preserving diagnostically relevant features suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments performed for measuring signal distortion loss and impact on reporting suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
