Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses baseline experiments using state-of-the-art computer vision classification and detection models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The dataset was collected using citizen scientists, which could make it relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
