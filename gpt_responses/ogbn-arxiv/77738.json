The paper also introduces a connection between game theory and discrepancy theory, which is a subfield of theoretical computer science that deals with the distribution of points in high-dimensional spaces (cs.DS). The paper uses techniques from combinatorics (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT) to prove its results. Finally, the paper discusses the convergence rate of dynamics to approximate equilibria, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
