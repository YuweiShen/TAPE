Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves training models to be style-invariant, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses neural networks and deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention using parallel and non-parallel corpora, which suggests the paper may fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) or computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
