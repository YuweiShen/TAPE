The paper proposes a novel framework for oblivious inference based on XNOR operations, which is a technique that is commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the optimization of the neural network architecture to minimize the runtime of the Garbled Circuits protocol, which is a topic that falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper evaluates the proposed framework on various datasets, including medical diagnosis, which is a topic that falls under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
