The proposed model uses a convolutional neural network as a feature extractor, which is a common technique in computer vision.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with sequence-to-sequence models, which are commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and speech recognition. Handwritten text recognition can also be seen as a language processing task.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed model is based on neural networks, which are a popular machine learning technique. The paper also discusses various attention mechanisms and positional encodings, which are common techniques in machine learning.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Handwritten text recognition can be seen as a form of information retrieval, where the goal is to extract meaningful information from unstructured data.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed model is a form of artificial intelligence, as it involves training a neural network to perform a specific task. Handwritten text recognition is also a common application of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
