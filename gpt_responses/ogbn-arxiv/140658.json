VLC can be used for indoor positioning and navigation, which is relevant to robotics. \n\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - VLC can also be used for visible light positioning, which is relevant to computer vision. The paper discusses joint localisation and communication, which is a topic that overlaps with computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
