Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the practical performance and construction time of the data structure, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also mentions the use of succinct solutions, which could place it in cs.DL (Digital Libraries) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
