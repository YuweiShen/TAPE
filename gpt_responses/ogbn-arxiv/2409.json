The paper specifically focuses on two-hidden-layer feedforward networks, which are commonly used in practical applications. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). However, the paper also involves approximation of continuous functions, which is related to topics in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
