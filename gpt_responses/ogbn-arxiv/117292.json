Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a 3D viewer and Augmented Reality device, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The paper also involves estimating depth maps, which could fall under the graphics (cs.GT) sub-category. The use of a CNN for training and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the mention of interactive rendering suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
