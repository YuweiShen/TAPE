This involves using a fuzzy and faceted classification scheme that is intuitive for the crowd to use, yet powerful enough to facilitate search by analogy, and flexible enough to deal with ambiguity. The paper also mentions linking up with the semantic web and computer intelligence, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR), digital libraries (cs.DL), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of citizen science to support innovation, which could fall under the categories of cybernetics (cs.CY) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
