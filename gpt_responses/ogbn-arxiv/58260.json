Additionally, the paper uses Markov Decision Processes and temporal difference reinforcement learning, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also analyzes the convergence of the proposed strategy, which is related to game theory (cs.GT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
