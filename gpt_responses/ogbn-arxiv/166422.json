This makes cs.DB a likely category. The paper also discusses the RAM model of computation and massively parallel computation (MPC) model, which are related to algorithms and complexity, making cs.DS and cs.CC likely categories. The paper also discusses lower bounds, which are related to complexity, making cs.DC a likely category.
