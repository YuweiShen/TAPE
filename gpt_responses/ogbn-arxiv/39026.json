This falls under the domain of computational engineering and science. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper heavily relies on machine learning algorithms for approximating important aspects of the brittle fracture problem. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the use of numerical methods, specifically finite element-discrete element modeling, to produce a training dataset and validate the results of the machine learning approaches. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper discusses the implementation of different machine learning algorithms and physics-based assumptions to develop reduced-order models. This falls under the domain of mathematical software development. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of reduced-order models that have significantly faster runtimes than the original high-fidelity model, which involves software engineering aspects such as optimization and efficiency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
