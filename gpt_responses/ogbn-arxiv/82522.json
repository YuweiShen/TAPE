The paper also introduces a noisy comparison model, which is a common topic in machine learning and crowdsourcing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DB (Databases). The paper also involves computational complexity analysis, which is a common topic in theoretical computer science, suggesting cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes output-sensitive algorithms, which are often studied in machine learning and optimization, indicating cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
