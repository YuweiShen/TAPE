Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). However, since the paper also proposes a novel modular network and uses end-to-end training, it could also fit into cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also uses regularization techniques and accounts for the discrete nature of module assembly, which suggests it could fit into cs.LG (Machine Learning) as well. Finally, since the paper deals with grounding in images, it could also fit into cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
