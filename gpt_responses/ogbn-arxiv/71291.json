The system is motivated by cloud radio access networks, which is a subfield of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The proposed transmission and relaying strategies involve optimization of power allocation, which is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of compress-and-forward relaying, which is a technique used in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of digital backhaul links, which is a topic in computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
