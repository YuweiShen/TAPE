This suggests that the paper could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper addresses issues related to efficiency, stability, and fairness, which could fall under the System and Control (cs.SD) or Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-categories.
