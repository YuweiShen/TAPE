This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically neural networks. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed approach aims to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance for graph similarity search, which is a classic yet challenging problem in artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed approach involves designing an attention mechanism to emphasize the important nodes with respect to a specific similarity metric, which is a common technique in computer vision and pattern recognition. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The proposed approach involves designing a pairwise node comparison method to supplement the graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information, which is relevant to natural language processing tasks such as sentence similarity computation. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of graph similarity search and proposes a model that runs in quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs.
