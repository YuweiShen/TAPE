The paper introduces an extension to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) that aims to mitigate negative side effects to other agents resulting from myopic goal-directed behavior. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with multi-agent settings, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Finally, the paper discusses the potential of bridge-work between machine ethics and RL, which could also place it in the category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
