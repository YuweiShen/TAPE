It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a method for training deep SNNs using traditional algorithms. Additionally, it could be classified under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with the development of intelligent systems. Computer Vision (cs.CV) is another possible sub-category as SNNs are often used in image recognition tasks. Finally, it could be classified under Systems and Control (cs.SY) as SNNs are used in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
