This involves modeling the temporal structure of video sequences of students solving math problems using a recurrent neural network architecture. The paper also presents a novel transfer learning facial affect representation and a user-personalized training scheme. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
