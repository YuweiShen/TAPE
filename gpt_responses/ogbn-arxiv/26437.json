This involves designing a novel receiver scheme with multi-antennas to deal with high-mobility challenges. Information theory is relevant in designing efficient communication schemes for such scenarios. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): V2X communication is a type of wireless communication network, and the paper discusses the challenges and solutions for improving the performance of such networks. This involves designing a receiver scheme with multi-antennas, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint MP-MRC iterative detection scheme for OTFS, which involves integrating maximum ratio combining (MRC) to improve the convergence performance of the iteration and gain an excellent system error performance. This is relevant to systems and control, which deals with designing and analyzing complex systems. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): V2X communication may involve transmitting multimedia data such as video and audio, and the paper discusses the use of OTFS waveform to improve the performance of such transmissions. This is relevant to multimedia, which deals with processing and transmitting multimedia data. \n\n5. cs.LG"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
