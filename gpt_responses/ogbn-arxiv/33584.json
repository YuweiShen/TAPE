The paper proposes a new algorithm for efficient path planning in graphs with expensive to evaluate edges. This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also involves machine learning techniques such as lookahead, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions manipulation problems using a 7-DOF manipulator, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
