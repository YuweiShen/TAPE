The use of pairwise comparisons and the formulation of the dueling bandit problem also suggest a connection to the field of decision making under uncertainty (cs.DS). Finally, the numerical experiments and evaluation of algorithms suggest a focus on practical applications and implementation, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
