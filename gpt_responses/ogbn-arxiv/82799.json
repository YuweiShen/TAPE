The paper also introduces new techniques for approximating these optimization problems, which may be of interest to researchers in information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses specific applications of these techniques to diversity maximization, which is a topic that falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
