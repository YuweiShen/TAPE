The paper also introduces a novel method for selectivity estimation through sampling, which involves statistical concepts and techniques such as the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (cs.DS) and random sampling (cs.LG). The paper's focus on optimization and efficiency also suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
