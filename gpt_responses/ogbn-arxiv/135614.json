Additionally, the paper specifically applies its techniques to image classification tasks, which would also suggest the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category. The paper also discusses strategies for handling probabilistic bypass during inference, which could potentially fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The use of per-batch loss and mode collapse could potentially fall under the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category. Finally, the paper's focus on improving accuracy in image classification tasks could potentially fall under the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
