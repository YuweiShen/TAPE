This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with hiding one image within another, which is a multimedia application. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Steganography is a technique used for secure communication, and this paper proposes a new method for image steganography. Hence, it could be categorized under cryptography and security.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method is based on a deep neural network, which is a machine learning technique. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based method for image steganography, which could be categorized under artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
