The use of fully convolutional neural networks suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The investigation of decision criteria and attribution methods suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The potential clinical applications and emphasis on comprehensibility suggest a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
