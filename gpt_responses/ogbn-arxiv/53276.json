The paper discusses the notion of complexity in theoretical computer science, making it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information. The paper discusses the relationship between complexity and information, making it a possible candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the study of efficient algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The paper discusses the complexity of computational problems, making it a possible candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. The paper discusses formalisms of statistical physics and quantum field theory, which are used in machine learning, making it a possible candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the study of the behavior of dynamical systems and the design of control systems.
