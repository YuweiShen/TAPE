The focus of the paper is on hub labels, which are a well-studied class of labels used in distance oracles. The paper introduces hierarchical labels, which are a special kind of hub labels, and compares their size to that of general hub labels. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), information theory (cs.IT), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
