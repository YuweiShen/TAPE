Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of these typefaces to expose the general public to intriguing results and hard problems, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction and user experience. This makes cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) a likely sub-category as well. \n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions specific applications of the typefaces in hinged dissections, geometric tours, origami design, computer-aided glass design, physical simulation, and protein folding, which suggests a focus on graph theory, discrete mathematics, and optimization.
