The proposed method involves learning a projection function from a feature space to a semantic embedding space, which is a common approach in natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on image datasets, which also suggests the relevance of multimedia (cs.MM) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
