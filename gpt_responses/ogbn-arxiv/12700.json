However, the paper also mentions optimization performance, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of fractional-order derivatives in image processing can also be seen as a signal processing problem, which falls under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
