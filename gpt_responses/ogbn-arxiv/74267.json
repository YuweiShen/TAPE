The model uses deep neural networks and imitation learning to predict appropriate social actions based on observable features of neighbors, such as location, gaze orientation, and body gestures. The paper also introduces a social signal gating mechanism called Kinesic-Proxemic-Message (KPM) gate, which filters incoming social cues from nearby agents. The paper's focus on social interaction and deep learning suggests that it could belong to categories such as cs.AI, cs.RO, and cs.LG. The use of observable features and body gestures suggests a potential fit with cs.HC, while the use of deep neural networks suggests a potential fit with cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
