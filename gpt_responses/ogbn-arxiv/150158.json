The use of graph-structured feedback suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of graph theory and network analysis (cs.DS). The presence of an adversary and the analysis of regret bounds suggest that the paper may be relevant to the fields of game theory and adversarial machine learning (cs.AI, cs.GT). Finally, the use of memory constraints in the adversary suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
