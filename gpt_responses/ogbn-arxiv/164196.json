The use of phased arrays and RF domain processing also suggests a possible fit with the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper proposes a low-complexity solution, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of quantization in the RF phase control could also make this paper relevant to the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
