Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with the effects of phase noise on network performance, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the use of mmWave bands in 5G NR is a topic related to cs.MM (Multimedia), and the design aspects of PT-RS involve aspects of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
