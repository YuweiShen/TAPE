The paper formulates the problem of determining the privacy mechanism that minimizes the mutual information between the private features of the original dataset and a released version subject to two types of distortion constraints. This problem is closely related to the fields of information theory, cryptography, machine learning, and data science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
