The paper also discusses the use of equational reasoning and type-checking for managing equalities, which is related to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The focus on program verification and constructing terminating programs suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of a control operator and subtyping may also relate to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and compiler construction (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
