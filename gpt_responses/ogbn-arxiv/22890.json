Specifically, the paper develops a novel family of algorithms for online learning with regret bounds against any data sequence bounded by the empirical Rademacher complexity of that sequence. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
