This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of a neural network for classification also suggests that the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of automated systems, which may suggest information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of ResNeXt and Squeeze-and-Excitation modules suggests that the paper may also fall under the deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
