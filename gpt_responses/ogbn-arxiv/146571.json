The abstract mentions that the model is designed to capture targets at different levels of granularity, which is a common approach in computer vision tasks. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a hierarchical architecture for video understanding that learns simpler tasks first and then moves on to more complex ones. This is a common approach in machine learning, and the paper mentions that the model is trained with a joint loss on different granularity levels. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Video understanding is a subfield of AI, and the paper proposes a hierarchical architecture that exploits the structure of real-world actions. The paper also mentions that the model achieves better performance on all levels, which is a common goal in AI research. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video understanding, which is a subfield of multimedia. The paper also mentions that the model is trained on the Something-Something dataset, which is a popular dataset for video understanding research. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions that the model is trained with a joint loss on different granularity levels, which is a common approach in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The paper also mentions that the dataset includes captions, which is a common aspect of NLP"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
