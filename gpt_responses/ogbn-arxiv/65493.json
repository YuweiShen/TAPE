The use of 3D data acquisition devices also suggests a potential overlap with robotics (cs.RO). The evaluation of performance of state-of-the-art descriptors may involve machine learning techniques, indicating a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
