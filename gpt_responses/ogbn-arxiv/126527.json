The paper presents a unified framework for constructing coresets and approximate clustering for general sets of functions. This problem is closely related to data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computational geometry (cs.CG), data mining (cs.DM), and scientific computing (cs.SC). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
