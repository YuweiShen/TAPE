The paper also discusses space-time tradeoffs, which are relevant to cs.DB (Databases) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on datasets, which could also be relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
