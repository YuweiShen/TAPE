The paper also discusses the use of active learning and data synthesis techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The use of physics-based methods to acquire labels suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the interpretability of the generative invertible network, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
