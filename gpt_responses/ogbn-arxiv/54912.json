Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves classification and retrieval, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of SVM for classification indicates that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with large datasets, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
