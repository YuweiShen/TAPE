The paper also discusses the use of reactive techniques and sampling-based iterative algorithms, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also mentions the use of planning algorithms, which are commonly used in control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV).
