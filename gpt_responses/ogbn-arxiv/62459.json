The paper also presents a proof for a wide class of coupled scalar recursions, which could be relevant to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The examples considered in the paper, such as joint iterative decoding of LDPC codes and compressed sensing, could also be relevant to the categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
