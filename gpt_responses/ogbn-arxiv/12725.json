The paper also discusses the efficiency of QBF solvers, which is a topic that falls under the area of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the complexity of different proof systems, which is a topic that falls under the area of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the relationship between different proof systems, which is a topic that falls under the area of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to solving QBFs, which is a topic that falls under the area of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
