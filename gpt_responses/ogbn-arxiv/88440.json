SLR is a common research method in software engineering, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). The proposed ontology, SLRONT, captures common terminologies and their relationships during SLR processes, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.DL, cs.LG) techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SE, cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.DL, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
