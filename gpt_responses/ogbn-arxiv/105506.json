This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The proposed structure is evaluated on tasks related to natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
