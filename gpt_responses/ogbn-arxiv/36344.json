Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely category as the paper mentions the use of RGB frames in creating the grasping dataset. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible categories as the paper proposes an unsupervised auto-encoding scheme to learn a representation of tactile signals and a re-grasping model that learns to improve grasps with tactile feedback. Finally, Systems and Control (cs.SY) is a possible category as the paper describes a system consisting of two steps for grasping novel objects using tactile sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
