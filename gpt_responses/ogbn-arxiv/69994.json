The system requires low-latency wireless communications between mobile miners and communication nodes, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the proof-of-work computation used in blockchain systems to verify the originality of data. This involves cryptography and security measures to prevent attacks on the system.\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a distributed system where the blockchain ledger is located at communication nodes and mobile miners process the proof-of-work computation. This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n4. cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing) - Similar to cs.DC, the paper proposes a distributed system for blockchain computation using mobile miners.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a system for blockchain computation using mobile miners and analyzes its performance. This falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
