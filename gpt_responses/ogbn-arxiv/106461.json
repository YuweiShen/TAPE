The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) sub-categories. Finally, the application of the proposed method to autonomous driving systems falls under the systems and control (SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
