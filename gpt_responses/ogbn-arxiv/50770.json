This technique is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) as it helps in finding bugs in programs. The paper also discusses the formal characterization of the class of programs for which the transformed program is guaranteed to be precise, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions the applicability of the technique on industry code, which is related to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
