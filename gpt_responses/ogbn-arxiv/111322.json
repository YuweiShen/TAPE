It also involves deep neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. The paper also mentions joint feature selection and dictionary learning, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of boosting algorithms and gradient descent methods also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
