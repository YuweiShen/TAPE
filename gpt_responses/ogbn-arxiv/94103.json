The paper proposes an interactive scheme that achieves a communication rate close to the Shannon limit, which is a fundamental result in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of communication between two terminals, which is a networking problem. The paper proposes a scheme that uses feedback to improve the communication performance, which is a common technique in networking. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the problem of communication between two nodes, which is a common problem in social and information networks. The paper proposes a scheme that uses feedback to improve the communication performance, which is a common technique in social and information networks. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of controlling the communication performance of a system, which is a common problem in systems and control. The paper proposes a scheme that uses feedback to improve the communication performance, which is a common technique in systems and control. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of transmitting information over a channel, which is a common problem in multimedia. The paper proposes a scheme that achieves a communication rate close to the Shannon limit, which is a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
