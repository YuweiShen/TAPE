The most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on the performance of curiosity-driven learning across multiple environments. The paper also discusses the use of different feature spaces, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper mentions limitations in stochastic setups, which could relate to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.GT (Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
