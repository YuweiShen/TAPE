The paper proposes a deep learning approach for bootstrapping a new domain without the need for labeled or unlabeled in-domain examples, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves multi-task training, which is a common technique in neural networks and falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper addresses the problem of domain scaling, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and system and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
