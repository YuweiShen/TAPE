This involves analyzing multidimensional data from vessels, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The need to detect illegal activities also suggests a potential connection to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of change detection methods may involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques, and the focus on real-time data streams suggests a potential connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
