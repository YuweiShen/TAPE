This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also involves the use of measurement campaigns and ray-tracing studies, which are common in the field of mobile and wireless communications (cs.MA) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses modifications to existing path loss models, which falls under the field of architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
