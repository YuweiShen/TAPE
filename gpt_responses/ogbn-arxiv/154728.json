It also involves deep learning architectures, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The methodology proposed in the paper involves reducing the computation and memory requirements of CNN models, which makes it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves testing the methodology on a dataset, which makes it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
