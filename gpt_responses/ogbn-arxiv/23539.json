This involves developing algorithms to efficiently select which stories to send for fact checking and when to do so. The paper also introduces a flexible representation of the procedure using the framework of marked temporal point processes. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Societal Computing). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
