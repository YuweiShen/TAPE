This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI), as the performance of the communication system is evaluated in terms of symbol error rate. The paper also discusses the impact of the Kerr nonlinearity on the system, which is a common topic in optics (cs.OH) and photonics (cs.PH). Finally, the paper proposes a heuristic demodulator, which involves optimization and decision-making, and thus falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
