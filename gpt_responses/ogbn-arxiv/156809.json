The paper discusses the use of flash photography to locate, identify, and view objects around corners. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of search and rescue personnel and endoscopes, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.GR (Graphics). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of vehicles, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also introduces a method that couples traditional geometric understanding and data-driven techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
