Additionally, the paper proposes a novel framework for learning person-specific gaze networks, which involves training a neural network, making it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the limitations of inter-personal anatomical differences, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the GazeCapture dataset, which is a common dataset used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
