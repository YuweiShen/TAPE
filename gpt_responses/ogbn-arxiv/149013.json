The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it proposes a new approach to learning in complex environments. It also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with arcade-game environments as sets of interacting objects. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a new approach to learning in complex environments. Finally, it involves systems and control (cs.SY) as it deals with the control of controllable objects in the environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
