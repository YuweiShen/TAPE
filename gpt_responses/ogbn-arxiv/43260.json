Additionally, the paper discusses the mechanisms of human recognition, which could also fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of deep neural networks also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
