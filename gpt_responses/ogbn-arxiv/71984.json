This suggests a strong connection to logic and formal methods.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper also introduces a novel approach to auditorium interaction, which involves live changes by both the presenter and the audience. This suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction and user interface design.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The use of a theorem prover and the development of a proof presentation framework may also be relevant to the programming languages community, particularly those interested in formal verification and type systems.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper may also be of interest to the software engineering community, particularly those interested in formal methods and software verification.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): While less likely, the paper's focus on interactive proof presentations and live changes may also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms community, particularly those interested in interactive algorithm visualization and teaching."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
