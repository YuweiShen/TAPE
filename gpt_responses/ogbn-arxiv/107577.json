Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of privacy in collaborative learning, which could place it in the \"Cryptography and Security\" (cs.CR) category. The use of a block coordinate descent algorithm and the asynchronous nature of the protocol could suggest that the paper could also belong to the \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) category. The paper also deals with the trade-off between utility and privacy, which could place it in the \"Social and Information Networks\" (cs.SI) category. Finally, the use of differential privacy could suggest that the paper could also belong to the \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
