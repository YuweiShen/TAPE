The focus is on visual navigation, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. However, the use of reinforcement learning and the application to mobile robots suggest that the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also proposes auxiliary tasks to improve visual navigation performance, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes an efficient neural network structure and evaluates its performance on an environment simulator, which suggests that it may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
