The paper also discusses the use of alternative layer types to batch-normalization (BN) layers, which are commonly used in deep learning models for regularization and normalization purposes, indicating that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for reducing the computational overhead of deep learning models for use in low-power embedded systems, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of different network architectures and bit-depths on model accuracy, which suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the design of deep learning models for use in real-time embedded vision systems, which suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
