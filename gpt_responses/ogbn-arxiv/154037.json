This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a multilayer feature aggregation method and a feature fusion strategy, indicating that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
