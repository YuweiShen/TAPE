The paper proposes a new method called Gradient-adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles (GradNAPs) to interpret features and representations in Deep Neural Networks. This method is applicable to any layer of a given network and can be used to gain insight into how data is processed in ANNs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and speech processing. \n\nThe paper also deals with visualizing features and clustering GradNAPs, which are techniques commonly used in Computer Vision (CV). Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a new method for interpreting Deep Learning models, which involves adjusting the gradients of neuron activations. This is a technique that falls under the sub-field of optimization, which is covered by cs.SD (Systems and Control). \n\nThe paper also deals with gaining insight into how ANNs accomplish their tasks, which is a topic covered by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new method for interpreting Deep Learning models, which involves visualizing features and clustering GradNAPs.
