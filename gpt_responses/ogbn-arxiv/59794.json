The concept of task difficulty is also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The mention of computational complexity suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC), while the discussion of task compositions and decompositions relates to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
