However, the paper also discusses bibliometric performance of researchers, which is a topic that falls under computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DL (Digital Libraries) which deals with the organization, retrieval, and distribution of digital information. The paper also discusses rescaling citation numbers, which is a topic that falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and citation analysis (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the effects of rescaling citation numbers on bibliometric performance, which is a topic that falls under social and information sciences (cs.SI) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
