The use of statistical distributions and the focus on individual and layout attributes suggest a possible connection to machine learning (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR). The experiments involve classification and ranking, which are typical tasks in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
