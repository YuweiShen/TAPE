Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the study of complexity and algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of imprecise input and the analysis of shortcuts in the problem could also make it relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
