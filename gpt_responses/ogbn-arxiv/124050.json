Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques to build a corpus of movie quotes and annotate them with memorability information, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of lexical distinctiveness and generalization in memorable quotes, which are concepts relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
