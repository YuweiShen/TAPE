The focus is on low-cost arms that rely solely on visual recognition, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The paper also mentions the use of reinforcement learning (cs.LG) for task accomplishment. Additionally, the approach presented in the paper involves creating synthetic data and leveraging geometric constraints, which could fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
