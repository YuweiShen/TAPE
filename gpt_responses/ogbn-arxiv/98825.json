The use of distortion side information also relates to perceptual effects and sensor calibration, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses transform-based quantizer constructions, which are often used in compression and coding algorithms and fall under the category of machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
