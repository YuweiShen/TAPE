This involves semanticizing neural patterns in conv-layers of the CNN and constructing an And-Or graph (AOG) to represent a four-layer semantic hierarchy of the part. The paper also uses active human-computer communication to incrementally grow the AOG on the pre-trained CNN. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
