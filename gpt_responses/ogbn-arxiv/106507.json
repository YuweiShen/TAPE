The paper proposes a method that combines arm kinematics and observations of conics in the image plane to estimate calibration extrinsics. This involves techniques from robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) to solve the hand-eye problem. The paper also mentions the use of this method in real-world applications, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
