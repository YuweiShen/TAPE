This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions that these algorithms are useful in privacy-preserving computations, which suggests a connection to cryptography and security.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses the concept of \"temperature\" to bound the distance of comparisons in Annealing sort, which is a term commonly used in information theory.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the worst-case time complexity of Spin-the-bottle sort and shows that there exists an input permutation that requires a certain amount of time to succeed. This falls under the scope of computational complexity.\n- cs.PR (Probability): The paper uses probabilistic analysis to show the expected time complexity and success probability of Spin-the-bottle sort and Annealing sort. This suggests a connection to probability theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
