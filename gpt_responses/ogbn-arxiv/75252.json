The use of spatio-temporal smashed filters also suggests a machine learning (LG) component. Additionally, the paper deals with compressive sensing (CS) and its application to video data, which makes cs.MM a likely sub-category as well. Finally, the focus on high compression ratios and the challenges of dealing with large amounts of video data suggest that cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
