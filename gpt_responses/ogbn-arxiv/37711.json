The use of multiple antennas and artificial noise also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed selection schemes for improving the achievable secrecy rate involve system-level optimization and decision-making, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
