Additionally, the study's objective of designing an automatic scoring mechanism for sentence-level formality aligns with the goals of the cs.CL community. The paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) due to the potential for developing automated scoring mechanisms. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category, as the study involves analyzing and categorizing text data. Finally, Cybersecurity (cs.CY) could be a relevant sub-category, as formality can be important in detecting and preventing phishing attacks and other forms of online fraud."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
