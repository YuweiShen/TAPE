The paper uses mathematical models to support their claim that mobile robots do not need to perform explicit localization in teach-and-repeat navigation scenarios. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a simple monocular teach-and-repeat navigation method that does not require camera calibration and can learn and autonomously traverse arbitrarily-shaped paths. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with the convergence of the position error model of a robot, which traverses a taught path by only correcting its heading. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses mathematical proofs to support their claims, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
