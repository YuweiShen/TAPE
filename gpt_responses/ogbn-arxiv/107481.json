The method involves training the network from coarse to fine, which involves learning representations and optimizing the model, indicating potential relevance to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its method on the COFW dataset, which is a common benchmark for facial landmark detection (cs.MM). Finally, the method involves adjusting weights and gradually decreasing them, which suggests potential relevance to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
