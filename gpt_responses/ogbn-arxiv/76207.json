This falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The use of blockchain technology for the proposed solution involves distributed computing and consensus mechanisms, which falls under the scope of this category.\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper describes a prototype implementation of the proposed system, which involves software engineering principles and practices.\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper addresses the issue of accountability and transparency in the current public key infrastructure, which has societal implications. \n5. cs.DL (Digital Libraries) - The paper proposes a solution for the issuance and management of digital certificates, which can be considered as a digital library application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
