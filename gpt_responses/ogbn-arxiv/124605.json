This problem has connections to several areas of computer science, including complexity theory (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), scientific computing (cs.SC), computational geometry (cs.CG), and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper presents new hardness results for two models of approximate Gr\u00f6bner basis computation, which are likely to be of interest to researchers in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
