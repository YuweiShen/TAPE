The use of human-operator input to guide the planning process involves artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The experiments involve simulation and real-world robotic setups, which may involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the comparison of success rates and planning times involves statistical analysis, which may involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
