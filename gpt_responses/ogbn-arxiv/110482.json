The problem also has security implications, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The caching and retrieval phases involve decentralized communication (cs.DC) and the optimization of download cost, which can be seen as a resource allocation problem (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
