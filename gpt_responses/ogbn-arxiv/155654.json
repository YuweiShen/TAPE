The use of accelerators and the focus on hardware implementation suggest that cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) is a likely category. The use of DNNs for tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely categories. The focus on accuracy and convergence suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is a possible category.
