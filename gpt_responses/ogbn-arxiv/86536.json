It may also belong to Programming Languages (cs.PL) as it discusses the similarities and differences between syntactically similar and functionally similar code clones. Additionally, it could be categorized under Software Development (cs.SD) as it addresses the practical implications of code clones in software systems. The paper may also be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) category as it discusses the need for clone detectors to be improved to manage and remove code clones. Finally, it could be categorized under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as code clones can pose security risks in software systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
