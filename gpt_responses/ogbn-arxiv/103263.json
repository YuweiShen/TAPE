The authors introduce a new approach to learning polynomial threshold functions and describe an algorithm for approximating DNF expressions from their Fourier coefficients. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the complexity of learning DNF expressions and describes an algorithm for approximating them. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of learning DNF expressions and describes an algorithm for approximating them. This falls under the scope of computational complexity. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of Fourier coefficients in approximating DNF expressions and describes conditions under which this is sufficient for learning polynomial threshold functions.
