The concept of outerplanarity is also relevant to planar graphs, which are often studied in computational geometry and graph theory. The paper also discusses the removal of vertices, which is a topic in graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS). The problem of triangulating graphs while maintaining certain properties is also relevant to optimization (cs.GT) and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
