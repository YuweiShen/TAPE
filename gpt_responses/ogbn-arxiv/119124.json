The paper also discusses parallel algorithms and computation models, which are relevant to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel algorithm for training ConvNets, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation and benchmarking of the algorithm on shared-memory machines, which is relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
