The approach involves compiling the learning task into a classical planning task, which is a subfield of both artificial intelligence and robotics (cs.PL and cs.RO). The paper also discusses the flexibility of the approach to different amounts of input knowledge, which suggests a potential application in machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
