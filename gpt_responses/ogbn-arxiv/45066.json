The proposed method involves analyzing the intra and inter-class distribution of iris codes, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper addresses the security and unlinkability of the proposed template protection method. The authors analyze the security of the approach and its applicability to relaxed iris imaging scenarios. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with iris recognition, which is a biometric modality used in multimedia applications. The proposed method aims to improve the performance of template protection for iris recognition. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper involves analyzing the intra and inter-class distribution of iris codes, which is a common technique in machine learning. The authors use low-rank iris codes to derive stable bits across iris images for a particular subject. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper deals with iris recognition, which is a biometric modality used in information retrieval applications. The proposed method aims to improve the performance of template protection for iris recognition, which is a crucial step in information retrieval systems that use biometric authentication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
