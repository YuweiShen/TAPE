This involves designing a technique called phantom sampling to avoid catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning. The implementation is based on deep neural networks, which suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of generative models and distillation of dark knowledge also suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The application of the strategy to competitive multi-class incremental learning of deep neural networks suggests a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of natural language processing techniques to evaluate the strategy suggests a connection to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
