The paper discusses the embedding of a network into a wider one with more hidden units and whether a minimum point of the narrower network gives a minimum or saddle point of the wider one. This topic is closely related to machine learning and neural networks, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
