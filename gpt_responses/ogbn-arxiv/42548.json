The use of a side-channel between mobiles also suggests a focus on networking and communication protocols, which could fall under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. The paper also discusses the interplay between channel uncertainty and the use of the side-channel, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. The use of multiple antennas and the impact on system performance could also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper discusses the system capacity region, which could be relevant to the Communications (cs.COM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
