The paper proposes a differentiable, end-to-end trainable framework for solving pixel-level grouping problems. The paper discusses the choice of embedding dimension and margin, which are related to theoretical results on the problem of distributing points uniformly on the sphere. The paper also proposes a variant of mean-shift clustering, implemented as a recurrent neural network parameterized by kernel bandwidth, to group instances. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
