The paper introduces a new information-theoretic framework for non-linear CCA, which extends the classical ACE approach. The paper discusses the theoretical bounds and optimality conditions of the proposed framework, which are related to rate-distortion theory, the information bottleneck, and remote source coding. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
