The use of Lagrange multipliers and dual functions is also a common technique in optimization and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the extension to rate distortion theory, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
