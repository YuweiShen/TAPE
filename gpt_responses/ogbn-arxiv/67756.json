The proposed algorithm is based on Bayesian learning, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with signal processing (cs.SP) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) as it proposes an efficient algorithm for large scale datasets. Finally, the paper deals with the correlation structure of signals, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
