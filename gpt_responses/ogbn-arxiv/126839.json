Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes novel deep multilevel multimodal fusion frameworks, which involves training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), indicating that machine learning (cs.LG) is also relevant. Additionally, the paper involves multimodal fusion (cs.MM), which is a subfield of computer vision and machine learning. The proposed frameworks are evaluated on publicly available datasets, indicating that human-computer interaction (cs.HC) is also relevant. Finally, the paper involves the use of sensors, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
