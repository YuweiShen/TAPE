The use of digital modulation and power-constrained fading channels suggests a focus on wireless communication (cs.MM) and networked systems (cs.NI). The optimization problems and numerical investigations involve power allocation and performance evaluation, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
