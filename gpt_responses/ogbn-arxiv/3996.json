The use of common information and protocols also suggests a connection to communication complexity (cs.CC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of local operations and public communication may indicate a link to quantum information and computation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
