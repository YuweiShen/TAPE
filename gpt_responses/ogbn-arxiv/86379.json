The paper also discusses the use of learned gated connections and regularization techniques, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on several datasets, including ImageNet and CIFAR, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
