The paper also discusses the computational complexity of applying the transform to all points in a data set, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper introduces a new Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform that allows for a fast query step, which is a topic related to search and information retrieval (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
