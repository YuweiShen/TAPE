Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses convergence properties and efficiency, which are topics commonly studied in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses implementation within MCTS, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses the principle of selective tree expansion, which is related to game theory and falls under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
