This involves the use of block precoding and block-sparse system models, which are closely related to information theory concepts. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme aims to improve the efficiency of small packet transmission in intelligent terminals, which is a key issue in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of multiple access schemes for simultaneous transmissions of many users, which is relevant to social and information networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on uplink data transmission in massive MIMO systems, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as video streaming. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper employs the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm for signal recovery, which is a data structure and algorithmic approach to compressive sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
