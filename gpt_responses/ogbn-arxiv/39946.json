This makes it likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. The paper also mentions applications of rational terms in constraint handling systems and coinduction, which makes it relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper describes the implementation of the extension and compares it with current coinductive transformations, which makes it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
