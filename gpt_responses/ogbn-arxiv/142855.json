The NP-hardness result also suggests that the problem is difficult from a computational complexity perspective, which could place it in sub-categories such as algorithms and complexity (cs.DM) or computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of cognitive experiments to motivate the study of RAC drawings could also make it relevant to sub-categories such as human-computer interaction (cs.HC) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
