The use of convolutional neural networks and LSTM networks also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on multi-modal MRI data suggests that the paper could also be categorized under neural engineering (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
