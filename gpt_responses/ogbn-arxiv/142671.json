Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with partitioning target audiences and assessing the best match for creatives, which suggests a possible fit with cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions a testing product for an advertising platform, which could relate to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
