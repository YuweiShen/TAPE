The use of wildcard characters and the need to compute wildcard-periods suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the field of combinatorics and computational geometry (cs.CC) or information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the use of randomized algorithms and space complexity analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of computational geometry and topology (cs.CGT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
