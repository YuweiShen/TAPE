The paper also discusses stochastic control, which involves dealing with uncertainty and randomness, and can be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also applies the proposed algorithms to physics-based control problems, which can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
