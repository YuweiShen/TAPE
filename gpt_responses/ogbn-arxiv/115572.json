The paper also introduces novel indices for measuring the effectiveness of probabilistic and cooperative information transmission, which relates to the sub-category of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the design of machine learning algorithms, which falls under the sub-category of \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses inductive biases for learners optimized for cooperative inference, which relates to the sub-category of \"Social and Information Networks\" (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the Teaching Dimension in deterministic settings, which falls under the sub-category of \"Logic in Computer Science\" (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
