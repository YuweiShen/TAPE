The focus on adaptivity and the use of regular variation theory and concentration of measure suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The mention of natural language modeling suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and possibly social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
