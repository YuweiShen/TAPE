The paper proposes a novel solution that exploits Structure-from-Motion, Bundle Adjustment, and available geometry priors to robustly estimate camera pose and automatically reconstruct a fully-dense 3D scene using the least possible number of images in various challenging tunnel-like environments. This work involves computer vision, robotics, graphics, and machine learning techniques, which are all relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of computer vision and pattern recognition, which are essential for the proposed solution. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of robotics, which are relevant to the use of UAV for tunnel inspection. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of computer graphics, which are relevant to the reconstruction and texture mapping of the 3D scene. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of machine learning, which are relevant to the use of available geometry priors for robust camera pose estimation. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of artificial intelligence, which are relevant to the use of UAV for remote"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
