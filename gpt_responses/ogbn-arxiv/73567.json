This falls under the domain of distributed computing, which is a sub-category of cs.DC.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper talks about the need for low-latency access to computing resources and the placement of resources at the access networks. This involves networking and internet architecture, which is a sub-category of cs.NI.\n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a management framework to build, manage, and monitor scalable edge infrastructures. This involves system design and control, which is a sub-category of cs.SY.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses incentivizing people to share their resources and the involvement of stakeholders. This involves the social and ethical implications of computing, which is a sub-category of cs.CY.\n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly mentions the limitations of OEC compared to regular cloud computing and fog deployment. This involves security and privacy concerns, which is a sub-category of cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
