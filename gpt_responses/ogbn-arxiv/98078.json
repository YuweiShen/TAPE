The use of inverse determinant sums and dyadic summing techniques suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). The study of the diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off and signal-to-noise ratio thresholds also suggests a connection to statistical inference (cs.SI) and information theory and signal processing (cs.ITP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
