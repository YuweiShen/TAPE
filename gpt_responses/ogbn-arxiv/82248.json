The study of bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) also suggests a possible fit for the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) and Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of constellation points and Gray codes points towards a possible fit for the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
