The approach uses reinforcement learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of multiple searching policies and the tree-structured traversing scheme suggest that this paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing to some extent, as it discusses the human perception procedure, which suggests that it may also be relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
