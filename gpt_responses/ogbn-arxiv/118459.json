The analysis is applied to tasks in computer vision (cs.CV) and arcade games, which further supports the inclusion of cs.CV. The paper also proposes a new method for characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines, which could fall under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
