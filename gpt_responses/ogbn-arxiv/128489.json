This makes it likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category deals with the use of logic in computer science, including the development of new logical systems and their applications. The paper's focus on interval neutrosophic sets and logic theory makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent systems and their applications. The paper's focus on a new logic system and its applications in computing, including data modeling and query constructs, makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n- cs.DB (Databases): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and management of databases. The paper's focus on a new data model based on interval neutrosophic sets and its query constructs makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of data structures and algorithms. The paper's focus on the properties and operations of interval neutrosophic sets makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems.
