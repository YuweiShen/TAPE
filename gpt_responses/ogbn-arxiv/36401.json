Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses automatic evaluation methods using linguistic features and deep learning models, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions correlation scores and quality estimation tasks, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
