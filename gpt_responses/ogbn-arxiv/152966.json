The paper also discusses the trade-off between accuracy and speed, which is a common concern in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of different metrics to split test images into easy and difficult batches also involves optimization techniques, which are often studied in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper uses pre-trained models and discusses their performance, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the computational requirements and inference speeds of deep neural networks, which are important considerations in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
