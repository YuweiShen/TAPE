The paper proposes algorithmic improvements to address the challenges of combinatorially large state and action spaces, sparse rewards, and partial observability. These challenges are typical of reinforcement learning problems, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with natural language processing and understanding, which suggests that cs.CL (Computation and Language) is another likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a contextualisation mechanism and studies different methods for selecting admissible actions, which are techniques that are relevant to machine learning and optimization, suggesting that cs.LG (Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its techniques on a series of text-based games, which suggests that cs.SD (Software Engineering) is a possible sub-category, as it deals with the design, development, and testing of software systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
