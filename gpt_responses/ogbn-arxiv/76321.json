This involves addressing the problem of exploiting temporally correlated structures and session-specific variability within EEG. The paper also proposes an adversarial inference approach to learn session-invariant person-discriminative representations. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as they are all related to deep learning and neural networks. The sub-categories cs.BIO (Computational Biology) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely as the paper deals with EEG biometrics and person identification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
