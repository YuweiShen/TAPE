The use of binary matroid minors is a combinatorial technique that is often used in coding theory (cs.IT), and the paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed constructions (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper proposes constructions that are optimized for small field sizes, which is a practical consideration that falls under the category of computer systems and networking (cs.DC) and potentially also social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
