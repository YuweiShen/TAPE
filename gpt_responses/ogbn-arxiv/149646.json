It also involves machine learning techniques such as feature extraction and category-specific combination functions, which are commonly used in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of selective search and bounding boxes regression method also suggests the possibility of the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of object context and interaction priors, which could be related to the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
