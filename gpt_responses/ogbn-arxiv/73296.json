The experiments are conducted on image datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN, and MNIST), indicating computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the teacher-student framework, which is a popular method in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The regularization technique proposed in the paper is based on adding noise, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the storage and runtime complexity of deep models, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
