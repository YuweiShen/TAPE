The paper also discusses lower bounds for various problems, including MaxCut and PSD Grothendieck problem, which are typically studied in the subfields of computer science related to algorithms, data structures, information theory, machine learning, and scientific computing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SD (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
