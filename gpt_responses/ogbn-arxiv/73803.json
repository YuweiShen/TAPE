This algorithm is benchmarked on a suite of continuous optimization problems. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution, such as genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies. The use of CMA-ES in the proposed algorithm makes this sub-category a likely fit.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time. The proposed algorithm can be seen as a learning algorithm that improves its performance over time by using a warm start. Therefore, this sub-category is also a likely fit.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with algorithms that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving and decision-making. The proposed algorithm can be seen as a problem-solving algorithm that aims to optimize multiple objectives. Therefore, this sub-category is also a likely fit.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. The proposed algorithm can be seen as an optimization algorithm that uses data structures and algorithms to improve its performance. Therefore, this sub-category is also a likely"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
