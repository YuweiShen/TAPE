The paper also mentions the codes' potential applications in distributed computing (cs.DC) and the possibility of an adversary controlling a portion of the communication paths (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the sparse structure of the codes, which could be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
