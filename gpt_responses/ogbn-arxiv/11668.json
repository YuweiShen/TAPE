The use of $\\epsilon$-coresets is a common technique in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG) to efficiently approximate solutions to optimization problems. The paper also discusses total sensitivity, which is a measure of the stability of an algorithm, and is relevant to both data management (cs.DM) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
