It proposes a recurrent neural network model for modeling asynchronous streams of data. The paper also introduces new metrics for quantifying the effects of promotion and user influence. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are:\n\n1. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis of social networks and online communities, which is the focus of this paper.\n\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing and machine learning for text analysis, which is relevant to the text-based data sources used in this paper.\n\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of machine learning algorithms, which is the focus of this paper.\n\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval and analysis of information from large datasets, which is relevant to the data-driven approach used in this paper.\n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the analysis and processing of multimedia data, which is relevant to the video-based data sources used in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
