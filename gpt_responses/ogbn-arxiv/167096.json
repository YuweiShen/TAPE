The paper also discusses the benefits of skip connections in computer vision tasks, which falls under the category of \"computer vision\" (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of skip connections in breaking symmetries in the loss landscapes of deep networks, which is a topic related to optimization and training of neural networks, falling under the category of \"machine learning\" (cs.LG) and \"artificial intelligence\" (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of skip connections in dealing with the vanishing gradients problem, which is a topic related to control systems and optimization, falling under the category of \"systems and control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
