Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Word embeddings are a type of machine learning model, and this paper presents new models for Hausa language. Therefore, cs.LG is also a likely category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Word embeddings are often used in information retrieval tasks such as document classification and search. This paper mentions several NLP tasks where word embeddings are useful, some of which are related to information retrieval. Therefore, cs.IR is a possible category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Word embeddings are a popular technique in AI and this paper presents new models for a specific language. Therefore, cs.AI is a possible category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Word embeddings are often based on neural network models, and this paper presents two different neural network models for word embeddings. Therefore, cs.NE is a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
