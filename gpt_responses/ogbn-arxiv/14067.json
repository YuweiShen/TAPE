The method uses abstraction refinement, which is a technique commonly used in formal verification and model checking, suggesting that the paper could also be relevant to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) community. The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed technique in a framework called \\tool, which could be of interest to the software engineering (cs.SE) community.
