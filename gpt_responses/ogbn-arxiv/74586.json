The package is designed to be scalable and can handle large datasets with millions of points (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of fast approximate neighbor searches and sparse eigendecompositions, which are common techniques in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA). Finally, the package incorporates theoretical advances in manifold learning, which could potentially fall under the category of computational geometry or topology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
