The proposed objective is based on a nonlinear dependency criterion called Statistical Distance Correlation, which is a statistical measure of dependence between two random variables. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories related to machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new method for supervised dimensionality reduction, which is a common problem in machine learning. The proposed objective is based on a statistical measure of dependence between variables, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for supervised dimensionality reduction, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The proposed objective is based on a statistical measure of dependence between variables, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Dimensionality reduction is a common problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, where high-dimensional data is often encountered. The proposed method could be applied to reduce the dimensionality of image or video data, for example. \n\ncs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a new statistical measure of dependence between variables, which could be of interest to the statistics community. The proposed method could also be seen as a statistical approach to supervised dimensionality reduction. \n\ncs.IT (Information Theory): The"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
