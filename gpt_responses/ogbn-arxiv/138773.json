The paper also discusses desirable properties of allocation rules, which can be seen as a problem in distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses axiomatic theory to analyze the allocation rules, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
