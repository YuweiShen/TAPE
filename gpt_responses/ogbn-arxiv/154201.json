Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also deals with data management and storage, which suggests categories such as cs.DB (Databases) and cs.OS (Operating Systems). The paper proposes a pipeline mechanism and a traffic-aware flushing strategy, which are related to system architecture and control, indicating categories such as cs.AR (Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
