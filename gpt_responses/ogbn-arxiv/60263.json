This falls under the domain of computer graphics.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The algorithm proposed in the paper involves the transformation of coordinates on a map, which can be seen as an image processing task. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the deformation of geographic regions and the fitting of regions together, which are problems in computational geometry.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for creating cartograms, which falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper demonstrates the use of the algorithm with applications to election results and spatial distribution of deaths, which are examples of social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
