The paper proposes a new framework for finding objects that avoid bad features or flaws, which extends the Moser-Tardos resampling algorithm to more general discrete spaces. The paper also introduces a new commutativity condition and proves its sufficiency for an arbitrary rule to work. The paper's focus on discrete spaces, algorithms, and combinatorial optimization suggests that it belongs to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
