This work involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for data analysis and interpretation. The use of a context-free grammar for branching in GBDTs also involves formal language theory (cs.DM) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the application of GBDTs to analyze near mid-air collisions (NMACs) involves computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) as it relates to the development of the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS X)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
