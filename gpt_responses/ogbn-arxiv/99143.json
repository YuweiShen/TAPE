The framework involves adjusting the weighting of examples, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. The manipulation of derivatives is a key aspect of the framework, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
