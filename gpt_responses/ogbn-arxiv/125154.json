The problem is also related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as the authors present a fixed-parameter algorithm. The problem is specifically studied on planar graphs (cs.CG), and the authors mention that their algorithm can be applied to a wider class of graphs, which may fall under discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
