This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system with partially observed states, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to control a system with adversarial perturbations and losses, which can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses online gradient descent to learn the controller, which is a well-known algorithm in the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's approach to control a linear dynamical system can be applied to robotics, which falls under the domain of robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
