It may also belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category as it deals with graph data structures. The paper's focus on formal semantics suggests it could also be categorized under Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Additionally, the use of nondeterministic programming and conditional rules could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's emphasis on abstraction and freeing programmers from low-level data structures could also make it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
