Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for OCR, which falls under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of transfer learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper discusses the online deployment of the OCR algorithm, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
