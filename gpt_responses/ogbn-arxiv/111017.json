The experiments are conducted on image datasets, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses vulnerability and adversarial attacks, which are relevant to cybersecurity (cs.CR). The use of active subspace as a model reduction method is related to optimization and efficiency, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
