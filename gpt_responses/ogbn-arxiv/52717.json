The paper also mentions the use of distributional semantics, which is a common technique in computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because it proposes a machine learning-based approach to predicting discourse relations. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of syntactic parse trees, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which often involves analyzing the structure of text. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions the use of coreference resolution, which is a task related to entity linking. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which includes topics such as entity recognition and linking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
