It introduces a new model of multi-prover rational interactive proofs and analyzes their power and efficiency. The paper involves complexity theory, game theory, and information theory, which are all relevant to computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity), followed by cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
