Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also involves the implementation and evaluation of the proposed technique on a testbed, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also mentions that the proposed technique does not introduce any traffic overheads and does not modify the CAN protocol, which involves aspects of software engineering and information theory. Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.IT (Information Theory) could also be possible sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
