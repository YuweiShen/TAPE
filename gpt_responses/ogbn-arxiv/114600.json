The paper also discusses the inclusion of physical properties such as location or distance in the rule set, which is relevant to the fields of control systems (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE). The use of orthogonal channels to model physical-layer interactions is also relevant to the field of programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper specifically mentions Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which is a subfield of computer science (cs.CY) that deals with the integration of physical and cyber systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
