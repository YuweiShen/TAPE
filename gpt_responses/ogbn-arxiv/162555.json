The use of anatomical priors and autoencoders also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The application of the proposed architecture is in medical imaging (cs.MED), specifically in MRI for pelvic bone segmentation. The use of deep learning in medical imaging is also a common topic in the sub-category of cs.NEURON."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
