This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The use of a near ML decoder and the effect of bit mapping on performance suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The consideration of the relay's reception and transmission modes suggests a system and control perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the use of a single antenna at each node suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
