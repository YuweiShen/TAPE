The library also includes a shape inference algorithm that infers a shape from representative sample documents, which is related to databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions additional safety guarantees, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). The library's integration with the F# type system and the formalization of the process and proof of a relative type soundness theorem are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
