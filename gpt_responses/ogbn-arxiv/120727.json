The paper presents new results on the complexity of the problem for a specific graph class, namely $S_{1,2,4}$-free graphs. This makes it likely that the paper would be classified under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
