This falls under the category of computational models and algorithms (cs.MA). The use of excitable automata also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the implementation of input/output ports, which relates to computer engineering (cs.CE). The use of automata networks and Boolean functions suggests a connection to discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses computational experiments and mappings, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
