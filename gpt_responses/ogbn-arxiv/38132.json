The use of Markov sources and random-walk state transitions also suggests a potential fit with the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also proposes a unified approach for sampling and scheduling, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use case of dynamic channel state information update suggests a potential fit with the Mobile Computing (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
