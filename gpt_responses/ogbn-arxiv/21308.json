This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the properties and tradeoffs of the constructed sequences, which can be analyzed using statistical inference (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes numerical examples to illustrate the construction procedure, which can be implemented using algorithms and data structures (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
