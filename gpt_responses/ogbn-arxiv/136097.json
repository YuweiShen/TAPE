The use of fiducial markers also involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of a factor graph optimizer, which is a common tool in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The application examples mentioned in the paper, such as visual localization and pose estimation, also suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of ROS, a popular robotics middleware, suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
