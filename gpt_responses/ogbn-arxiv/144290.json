The proposed pilot allocation scheme involves reusing pilot sequences among non-adjacent cells, which is a technique commonly used in wireless communication systems (cs.SI). The paper also focuses on linear combining techniques at the base station, which is a topic related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the improvement in spectral efficiency, which is a performance metric commonly used in communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
