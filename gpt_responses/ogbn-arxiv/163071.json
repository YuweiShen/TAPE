The paper proposes a novel distributed algorithm for beam scheduling to maximize spectral efficiency. This problem involves aspects of networking (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), millimetre-wave communication (cs.MM), system optimization (cs.SY), and distributed computing (cs.DC). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
