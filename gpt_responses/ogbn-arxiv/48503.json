The use of orthogonal polynomials and ensembles in the analysis suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical theory (cs.ST) perspective. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
