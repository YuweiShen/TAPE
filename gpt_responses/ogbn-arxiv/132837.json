The paper focuses on community question answering and proposes an unsupervised framework for question retrieval using deep semantic representations, shallow lexical mismatching information, and an external search engine. The paper also introduces attention autoencoders to generate semantic representations of questions. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language), \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval), and \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning). The paper also involves natural language processing and neural networks, which make \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
