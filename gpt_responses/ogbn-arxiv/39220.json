The paper uses Altmetric to select webpages related to vaccination and then tests a method for ranking research articles relative to each webpage using a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach. This involves analyzing the relationship between the webpage and the research articles to identify the most relevant ones. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SD (Software Development and Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
