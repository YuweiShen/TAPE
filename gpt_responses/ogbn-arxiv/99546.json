Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also proposes to leverage learning-to-rank principles, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions heuristic approaches and probabilistic models, which could place it in the sub-categories cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the term occurrence pattern, which could suggest a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
