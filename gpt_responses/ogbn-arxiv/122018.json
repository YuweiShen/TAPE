The paper also uses properties of the discrete Gaussian distribution, which is a common topic in coding theory (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of lattice constellations and shaping techniques also suggests a possible fit in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper's analysis and characterization of the finite-blocklength behavior may also be relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
