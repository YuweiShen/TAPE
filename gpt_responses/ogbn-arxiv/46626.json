The focus on inter-signal correlation and distributed algorithms suggests signal processing (cs.SI) and distributed systems (cs.DS) as likely categories. Finally, the use of simulations to demonstrate performance suggests machine learning (cs.LG) as a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
