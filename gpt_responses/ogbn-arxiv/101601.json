The proposed strategy involves adjusting the precoding methods to improve system sum rates while maintaining the number of simultaneously served users, which also relates to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses linear precoding transmission modes and modifies them based on the number of data streams and multiple-antenna configuration of users, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity scheme that does not require instantaneous channel state information, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
