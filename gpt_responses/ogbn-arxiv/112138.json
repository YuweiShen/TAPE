The paper also discusses the use of sparse and mixed norm constraints, which are commonly used in optimization problems in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also discusses interference avoidance and robustness against mismatch, which are topics studied in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper deals with the application of these techniques in practical scenarios, such as wireless communication and radar systems, which fall under the subfield of signal processing and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
