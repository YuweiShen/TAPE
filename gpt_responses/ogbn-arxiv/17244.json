The paper also proposes a learning-based approach to address the challenges of coordination and cooperation, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of prediction models and the cross-entropy method for proposing and evaluating navigation goals also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the challenges of adapting to changing environments and coordinating from noisy sensor inputs, which are common issues in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper specifically addresses the challenges of decentralized multiagent planning, which is a subfield of multiagent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
