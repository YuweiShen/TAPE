These techniques are commonly used in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video surveillance, which is a multimedia application. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not directly deal with cryptography and security, but video surveillance is often used for security purposes, and the proposed approach could have potential applications in security systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
