The paper also discusses strategyproofness and other properties of the allocation mechanisms, which are important concepts in game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses allocation mechanisms that can be used in multi-agent systems, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses randomized allocation mechanisms, which are commonly used in AI applications. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses algorithms for solving the multiple assignment problem, which is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses the complexity of the allocation mechanisms, which is an important concept in this field. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the concept of envyfreeness, which is a common concept in machine learning fairness. The paper also discusses the use of randomized allocation mechanisms, which are commonly used in machine learning applications. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper discusses allocation mechanisms that can be used in multi-agent systems, which is a common topic in this field.
