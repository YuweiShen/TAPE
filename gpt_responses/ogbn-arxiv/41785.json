Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new framework for federated learning, which involves optimization algorithms and techniques, making it relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Finally, the paper provides convergence guarantees and demonstrates improved performance on federated datasets, which are topics of interest in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
