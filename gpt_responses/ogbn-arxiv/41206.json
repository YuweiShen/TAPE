The paper also focuses on exploiting the correlation structure of the sensing matrix, which is a topic of interest in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper provides empirical comparisons, which is a common practice in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
