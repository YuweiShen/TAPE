The paper also introduces a new technique for constructing such colorings based on 1-factorizations. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), followed by cs.GT (Graph Theory) and cs.CO (Combinatorics). The paper also involves some computational aspects, such as determining the exact values of $W(K_{2n})$ for small values of $n$, which could place it in the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
