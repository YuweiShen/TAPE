The proposed solution involves the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically LSTM, to predict the mobility patterns of user equipment. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.NI (Networks and Internet Architecture) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the use of deep learning algorithms for prediction also indicates that the paper could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The proposed mechanism involves establishing a dual connection for the related UE, which involves coordination between different base stations, suggesting that the paper could also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
