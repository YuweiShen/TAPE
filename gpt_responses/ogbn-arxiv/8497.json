The approach involves formulating the problem as a nonlinear program, which is a technique commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of stochastic finite state controllers suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA), and the incorporation of a shared source of randomness is a technique often used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
