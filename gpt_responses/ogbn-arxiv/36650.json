The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for acoustic modeling suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The adaptation of the DNNs for in-domain acoustic modeling may also relate to signal processing (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
