This involves computer vision techniques for 3D human pose estimation, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes an algorithm for predicting the future location of the drone, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques, falling under the categories of robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of motion planning for the drone, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
