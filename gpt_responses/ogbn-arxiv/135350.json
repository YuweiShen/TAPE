The paper discusses the use of nuclear norm and group lasso for low-rank approximation and personalized pattern identification, respectively. These techniques are commonly used in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, statistics, and natural language processing, which are covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.STAT, and cs.CL. Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
