The use of vector-field based keypoint voting and the proposed differentiable proxy voting loss are common techniques in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the task of object pose estimation is relevant to robotic manipulation. The use of machine learning techniques such as end-to-end training and differentiable loss functions also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with the estimation of object poses in 3D space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
