The proposed algorithmic-independent geometric analysis and L1-regularized Support Vector Machine formulation are both techniques commonly used in machine learning and optimization. The paper also discusses the sample complexity of the proposed formulation, which is a topic often studied in the fields of robotics and control (cs.RO, cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of a finite-state and action problem, which is a topic commonly studied in the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
