This involves discovering, ranking, and presenting patterns to domain experts in an interpretable form, who then indirectly batch-annotate candidate pairs whose relationship is expressed with such patterns in the literature. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves natural language processing techniques for extracting new facts from biomedical literature. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves ranking and presenting patterns to domain experts, which is a common task in information retrieval. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not require training data, it involves learning a better ranking of the patterns to be annotated or generating weakly labelled pairs in a fully automated manner when a small number of relevant pairs exist. This suggests that machine learning techniques may be involved. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves constructing knowledge bases, which is a common task in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper involves constructing a knowledge base from scratch, which is a common task in databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
