Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) are likely sub-categories. The algorithms also involve geometric concepts, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions improving previously known bounds on the problems, indicating a connection to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
