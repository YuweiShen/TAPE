The paper also discusses the improved decoding properties of the constructed ensembles, which is relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the use of protographs, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
