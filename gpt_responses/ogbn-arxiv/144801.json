This problem is related to the field of signal processing and control, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also applies the proposed method to vision-based aircraft detection, which involves image processing and computer vision techniques, falling under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also uses statistical methods to establish bounds on the performance of the proposed method, which falls under the category of statistics (cs.ST) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to develop a filter for estimating detection delays, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
