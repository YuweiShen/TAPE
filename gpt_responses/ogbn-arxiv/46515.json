It could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it focuses on neural networks. Additionally, since the datasets used in the experiments are image datasets, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the paper deals with data storage and compression, it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
