The paper also mentions the need for effective information passing to not-expert users, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of artificial neural networks and Prolog solvers suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and logic programming (cs.CYBER), respectively. Finally, the mention of a theoretical underpinning for a general framework suggests a focus on theoretical computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
