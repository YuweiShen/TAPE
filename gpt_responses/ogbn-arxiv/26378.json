However, since the focus is on morphological problems, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of neural networks suggests cs.NE as a possible sub-category, while the application to natural language processing could also justify cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
