The paper focuses on improving the discriminability of the learned metric, which is a common goal in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. The method is formulated as an optimization problem, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
