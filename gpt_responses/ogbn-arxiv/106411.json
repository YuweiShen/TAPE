Additionally, the paper focuses on deep reinforcement learning, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves decision making and action selection, which suggests that it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category.
