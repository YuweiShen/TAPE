The paper also discusses the use of binary features such as ORB, FREAK, and BRISK, which are commonly used in image retrieval and fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper proposes an approximation method to accelerate the Fisher vector, which involves statistical modeling and optimization, and thus falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves experiments and evaluation of the proposed method, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes an improvement in image retrieval accuracy, which involves the use of machine learning techniques, and thus falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
