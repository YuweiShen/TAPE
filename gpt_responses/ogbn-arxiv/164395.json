Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper introduces a novel regularization technique that is directly applied to the weights of the CNNs, which could also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
