This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents a theoretical framework for achieving convolution operation on Riemannian manifolds, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also presents experiments on computing principal linear subspaces on a Grassmannian, which could fall under computational geometry (cs.CG) or graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
