This involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper also discusses the issue of vocabulary gap, which relates to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it involves ensuring that the terms used in the query and product description are semantically similar. Finally, the paper uses historical query reformulation logs, which could be considered a form of data analytics and falls under the sub-category of Cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
