The proposed method uses a probabilistic grammar model (cs.AI) to represent indoor scenes and encodes contextual relations using Markov Random Fields (cs.LG). The evaluation of the synthesized rooms involves human subjects, which suggests a potential application in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
