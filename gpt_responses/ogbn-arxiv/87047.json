Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial designs and graph theory, which are related to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper proposes a construction that improves the lower bounds on the maximal size of permutation arrays, which is related to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
