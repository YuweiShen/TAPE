The paper also discusses the limitations of these models in capturing logical inferences, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new dataset and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art models, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
