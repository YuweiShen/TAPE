This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also investigates and compares reinforcement learning based meta-learning approaches for finding suitable neural network architectures, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses neural architecture search, which is a sub-field of both machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper also mentions the use of neural networks for classification, which falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed method to bridge inspection, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
