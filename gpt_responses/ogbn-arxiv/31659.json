The approach also involves natural language processing techniques to handle the narration in the videos (cs.CL). The proposed method is a new learning approach, which suggests it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the method involves action recognition, localization, and segmentation, which are common tasks in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also involves text-to-video retrieval, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
