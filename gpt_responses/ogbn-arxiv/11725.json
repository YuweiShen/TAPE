The proposed method involves selecting the most discriminative features via an online vector boosting method, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The method also involves updating the object representation in an online manner, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve tracking objects in videos, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the method involves trajectory rectification, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
