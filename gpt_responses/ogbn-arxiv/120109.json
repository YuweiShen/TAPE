The protocol is designed to be scalable and suitable for all IoT devices, which suggests a focus on system-level design and engineering (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper evaluates the protocol's performance in terms of memory footprint and runtime, indicating a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
