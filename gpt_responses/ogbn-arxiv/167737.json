The paper presents graph theoretic results and a combinatorial algorithm to identify edges that cannot occur in any optimum TSP tour. This makes cs.DM the most likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a combinatorial algorithm to identify edges that cannot occur in any optimum TSP tour. This algorithm can be considered as an AI technique for solving the TSP problem. Hence, cs.AI is a likely category for this paper.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The TSP problem is a well-known problem in robotics, and the paper proposes a method to solve large TSP instances. Hence, cs.RO is a likely category for this paper.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper deals with the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is an NP-hard problem. The paper proposes a method to solve large TSP instances, which can be considered as a contribution to the field of computational complexity. Hence, cs.CC is a likely category for this paper.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a combinatorial algorithm to identify edges that cannot occur in any optimum TSP"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
