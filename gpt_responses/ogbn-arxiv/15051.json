The paper also discusses the limitations of MDP-based POMDP solvers, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses the well-known tiger problem to demonstrate the sub-optimality of MDP-based POMDP solvers, which is a classic problem in decision theory and decision making (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
