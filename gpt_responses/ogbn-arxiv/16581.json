The method is based on graph signal recovery and clustering hypothesis, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The data is network-structured, which relates to the field of network analysis (cs.SI, cs.DS). The proposed algorithm involves optimization, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
