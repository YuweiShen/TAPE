The model is evaluated on a knowledge graph, which is a type of structured data often used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the model at lower dimensionality, which is a common concern in the field of scalable and efficient algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
