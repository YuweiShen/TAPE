Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also presents bounds on conditions for $k$-Fourier-sparse signals, which is related to compressed sensing and machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Sound and Image Processing) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which suggests that cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
