Specifically, the paper proposes a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model for selecting the set of locations to take measurements in order to reduce the posterior variance of the Gaussian process. This problem falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
