Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of machine learning algorithms, which could place it in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category.
