The paper discusses the basics of effectus theory, including the duality between states and effects, and the logical notions of comprehension and quotient. These topics are relevant to several subfields of computer science, including logic (cs.LO), quantum computing (cs.QA), programming languages (cs.PL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information theory (cs.IT). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
