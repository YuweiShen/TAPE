The use of algebraic methods and Gaussian elimination may also suggest a connection to linear algebra and optimization (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the implications of its results for artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
