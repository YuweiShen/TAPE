The paper also focuses on the design and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed interactive security analysis dashboard is a tool for managing complexity, which is a common concern in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the importance of visualizations in assisting security analysts, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the potential safety hazards that can result from security violations in cyber-physical systems, which is a topic in the emerging field of cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
