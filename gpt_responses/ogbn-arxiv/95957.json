Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a data-driven approach to adversarial examples defense, which involves training a CNN on a feature database. This approach falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (LG), artificial intelligence (AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing defense methods and the need for a quantitative representation of changes in sample characteristics, which relates to the sub-category of cryptography and security (CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
