The use of game theory to induce cooperation among selfish nodes suggests that the paper may also belong to the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The concept of fairness is also discussed, which is a topic commonly studied in the information theory (cs.IT) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories.
