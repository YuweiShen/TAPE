This falls under the domain of information theory.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with enhancing the throughput in ultra-dense small cell networks, which is a networking problem. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a technique to optimise the deterministic fractional delay to minimise spatial correlation, which can be seen as a control problem. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with enhancing the throughput of MIMO systems, which can be considered as a multimedia problem. \n- cs.COM (Computers and Society): This category is less likely, but the paper may have implications for society in terms of improving the efficiency of wireless networks, which can have a positive impact on communication and connectivity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
