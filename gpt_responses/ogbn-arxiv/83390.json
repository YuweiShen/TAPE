It also proposes a classification scheme for quality models. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the context-dependency of software development, which could also place it in the Software Design (cs.SD) sub-category. The paper also mentions the need to control and measure various quality aspects of development artifacts and processes, which could place it in the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the need for guidance on selecting and adapting quality models, which could place it in the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the lack of support for quality models, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
