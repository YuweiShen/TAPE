The paper also focuses on the verification and certification challenges of ANNs, which is a topic that falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper specifically addresses the resilience of ANNs to noisy or maliciously manipulated sensory input, which is a topic that falls under the category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the autonomous maneuvering of robots, which is a topic that falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper uses mixed integer optimization problems (MIP) to compute maximal resilience bounds for ANNs, which is a topic that falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
