The paper discusses the convergence of gradient noise (GN) to a heavy-tailed $\\alpha$-stable random variable, which is a topic related to machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the generalized central limit theorem (GCLT), which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper proposes to analyze SGD as an SDE driven by a L\\'{e}vy motion, which is a topic related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the tail behavior in varying network architectures and sizes, loss functions, and datasets, which is a topic related to statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
