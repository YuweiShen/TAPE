The paper proposes a new framework for training structured prediction networks using an adversarial process, which involves training a structure analyzer to provide supervisory signals. This framework involves a combination of machine learning techniques, including adversarial training (cs.LG), reinforcement learning (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates its approach on various base architectures, which involves experimentation and evaluation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
