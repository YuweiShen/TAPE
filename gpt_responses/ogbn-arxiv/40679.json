The proposed method involves learning a better video object detector, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions clustering of object proposals, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM). The use of class-label propagation suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with efficient detection of objects in videos, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
