The focus of the paper is on stochastic neural networks, which combine the power of large parametric functions with that of graphical models, making it possible to learn very complex distributions. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The experiments conducted in the paper involve structured output prediction and discrete latent variable modeling, which are tasks commonly associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
