The Transformer is also a deep learning architecture proposed for solving natural language processing tasks. \n- cs.SE: The paper discusses the use of deep neural networks to solve a challenging problem in software engineering (trace generation for LTL). \n- cs.PL: The paper discusses the semantics of linear-time temporal logic, which is a formal language used in programming languages and verification tools."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
