The paper also includes formal definitions and proofs, which suggest a connection to logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper proposes a new technique for SyGuS, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of SyGuS tools, which could be considered a topic in formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
