The proposed method involves modifying the sensing and reconstruction process, which involves signal processing and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions the use of a fast preview for the purpose of prediction, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM). The enforcement of smoothness across block borders can also be considered a graphics problem (cs.GR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of PSNR and SSIM index to assess quality, which are common metrics in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
