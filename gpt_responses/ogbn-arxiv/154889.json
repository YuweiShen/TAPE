The paper also discusses the process of configuring hardware/software interfaces, which is a software engineering (cs.SE) task. Additionally, the paper deals with cyber-physical systems (cs.EM) and system engineering (cs.SY) in the context of robotic platforms. Finally, the paper applies model checking using declarative languages, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
