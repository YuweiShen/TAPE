The use of solar reflectors and ground robots also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The mission logistics and planning may involve machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.MA). Finally, the analysis of the ice deposits and their composition may require computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
