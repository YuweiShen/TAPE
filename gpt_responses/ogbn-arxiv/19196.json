The use of game theory (cs.GT) to model the interaction between defender and attacker agents further supports these categories. Finally, the practical application of the approach to the Bitcoin P2P network suggests a potential fit with the social and information networks category (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
