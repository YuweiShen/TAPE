Additionally, the language is designed for parallel systems, which could also place it in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The use of clocks as a synchronisation mechanism could also relate to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The study of clocks and their interaction with parallel computations could also be relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Finally, the paper aims to improve the flexibility of the X10 language, which could also place it in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
