The approach involves using a time window approach to extract temporal information from time-series data in a source domain with observed RUL values and a target domain containing only sensor information. The proposed Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach is used to learn domain-invariant features that can be used to predict the RUL in the target domain. This paper involves machine learning, neural networks, and domain adaptation, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, cs.NE, and cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
