The paper also mentions the use of percentile rank classes, which is a common approach in information retrieval (IR) research. Therefore, cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the normalization of papers, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.CY (Computational Geometry) as well as cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper mentions the potential negative correlation between citation indicators, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
