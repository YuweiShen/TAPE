The proposed models use sequence learning, which falls under the category of multimedia (MM) and ML. The paper also discusses the use of equirectangular heatmaps, which are commonly used in CV applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.MM and cs.CV. Additionally, the paper involves ML techniques such as deep learning, which falls under the category of ML (cs.LG). The evaluation of the proposed models involves comparing them with benchmark models, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed models in on-demand video streaming, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Therefore, the least likely sub-category is cs.CL (computational linguistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
