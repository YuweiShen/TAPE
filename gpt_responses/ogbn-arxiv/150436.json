This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) since the methods discussed involve training models on large amounts of text data and using them to detect semantic shifts. Additionally, the paper touches on the challenges and prospects of this emerging subfield, which could fall under the category of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
