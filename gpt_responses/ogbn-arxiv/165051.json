The control design procedure is decentralized, and the performance of the proposed controllers is studied through simulations. \n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper focuses on voltage and frequency control in Islanded microGrids (ImGs) composed by the interconnection of Distributed Generation Units (DGUs). The proposed controllers regulate voltage and frequency at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) of each DGU and they are able to guarantee stability of the overall ImG. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a decentralized control scheme for Islanded microGrids (ImGs) composed by the interconnection of Distributed Generation Units (DGUs). The control design procedure is decentralized, and the proposed controllers are able to enable Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a new control scheme for Islanded microGrids (ImGs) composed by the interconnection of Distributed Generation Units (DGUs). The proposed controllers are able to enable Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations, which is an emerging technology in the field of microgrids. \n"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
