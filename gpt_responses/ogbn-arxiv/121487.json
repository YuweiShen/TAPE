This involves modeling the distribution of hard instances without hand-engineered features. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI, which deals with artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper also involves data structures and algorithms for graph problems, which suggests cs.DS and cs.DM as likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves computational complexity and benchmarking of algorithms, which suggests cs.CC as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experiments and evaluation of the proposed method, which suggests cs.LG as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
