The proposed method involves detector learning, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of spectral clustering, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
