Additionally, the paper introduces a data-driven method for building neural network constitutive models (NNCMs) to learn stress-strain relationships from force-displacement data, which is a common approach in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of quasi-static ultrasonic (US) elastography techniques, which are commonly used in biomedical imaging (cs.BIO). \n\nThe use of neural networks to model stress-strain relationships is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the reconstruction of a Young's modulus image, which is a type of medical imaging (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
