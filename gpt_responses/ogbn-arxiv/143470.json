The use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of video-based re-identification could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new training process, which could suggest it belongs to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the performance of the proposed models, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
