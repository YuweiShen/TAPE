The paper also discusses the use of different network architectures and training schemes, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel training scheme called Scale Normalization for Image Pyramids (SNIP), which involves back-propagating gradients of object instances of different sizes, which is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
