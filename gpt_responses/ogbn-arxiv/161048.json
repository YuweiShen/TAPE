This falls under the scope of computational game theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of common elements or mechanics in video games suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The analysis of the complexity of video games also involves the study of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
