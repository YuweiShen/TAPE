Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of automatic metrics and human evaluation, which are common in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI and cs.LG). The authors also mention the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in NLP and machine learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of translation quality, which can be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) if the translations involve image or video captions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
