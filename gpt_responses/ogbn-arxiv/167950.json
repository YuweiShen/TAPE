The paper also deals with robotics (cs.RO), as it tests the proposed method on robotic environments. The use of a Q-filter and auxiliary behaviour cloning loss suggests a focus on deep reinforcement learning (cs.AI), and the use of OpenAI Gym suggests a focus on benchmarking and evaluation (cs.SY). Finally, the use of robotic environments suggests a possible focus on computer vision (cs.CV) for perception tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
