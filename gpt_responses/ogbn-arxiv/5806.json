The paper proposes a novel unsupervised online VOS framework that incorporates salient motion detection and object proposal to effectively remove detection noises and deal with unreliable motion detection and object proposals. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also leverages machine learning techniques such as object proposal and forward propagation algorithm, which makes it relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which is relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
