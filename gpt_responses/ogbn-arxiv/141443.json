The problem of planarity testing is a classic topic in computational geometry, which falls under the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) category. The paper also involves combinatorial and graph-theoretic techniques, which could place it in the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) categories.
