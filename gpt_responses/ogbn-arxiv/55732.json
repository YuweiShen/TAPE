This involves optimizing the wireless propagation environment, which is a key aspect of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the performance of a multiuser system aided by multiple IRSs that are randomly deployed in the cell. This involves analyzing the network architecture and its impact on system performance. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of IRSs to optimize the wireless propagation environment, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the spatial throughput of a multiuser system, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper discusses the deployment strategies for IRSs and active relays, which can be seen as a multiagent system optimization problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
