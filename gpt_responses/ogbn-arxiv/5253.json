The paper also discusses the use of random announcements and provides constructions, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper establishes an equivalence between perfectly secure strategies and designs, which could be relevant to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
