This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The use of linear SVMs and Fisher Vector representation suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The integral image representation and efficient computation also suggest a focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
