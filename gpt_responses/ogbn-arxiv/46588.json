Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves wireless communication and networking, which suggests categories such as cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper specifically focuses on massive MIMO systems, which suggests categories such as cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
