This falls under the scope of neural and evolutionary computing.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an algorithm for solving optimization problems, which is a common area of research in artificial intelligence. The use of differential evolution operators and adaptive scheduling also falls under the scope of AI.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a method for combining multiple units of algorithmic information, which is a common theme in machine learning. The use of CMA-ES and differential evolution operators also falls under the scope of machine learning.\n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper applies the proposed algorithm to engineering problems, which falls under the scope of computational engineering. The use of optimization techniques is also relevant to computational finance and science.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes an algorithm that uses adaptive scheduling to toggle between exploitation and exploration, which is a common theme in systems and control. The use of viability evolution to drive a population of local search units toward feasible regions also falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
