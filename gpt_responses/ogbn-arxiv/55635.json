The proposed method involves introducing locally adaptive activation functions, which is a technique used in neural network optimization (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of the proposed method in solving physics-informed problems, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve image classification tasks, which is a common application of deep learning in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical properties of the proposed method, which could fall under the category of statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
