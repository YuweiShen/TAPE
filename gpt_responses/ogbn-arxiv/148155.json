The paper also discusses the need for robustness in safety-critical systems, which falls under the sub-field of computer security (cs.CR). The use of Gaussian process classifiers and the testing of the method on various datasets suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-fields of computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
