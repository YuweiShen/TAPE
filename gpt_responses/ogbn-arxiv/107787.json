The paper also proposes an analytical model based on ray tracing to compute the electric field intensity inside the chip, which involves topics related to cs.AR (Augmented Reality) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The study of the channel inside the chip to minimize latency and power is also relevant to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
