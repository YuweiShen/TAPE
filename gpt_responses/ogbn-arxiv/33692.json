It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as 3D pose estimation is a common task in robotics. The use of synthetic depth images suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category due to the use of depth images and the generation of synthetic data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
