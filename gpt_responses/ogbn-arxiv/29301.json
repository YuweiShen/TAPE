This involves optimization problems related to signal processing, information theory, and communication engineering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
