This involves using motion as a signal to model the change between poses. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves training CNNs without human supervision, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of motion as a signal for pose estimation also involves modeling and prediction, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with action recognition in videos, which falls under the sub-categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
