The paper also draws inspiration from classical computer graphics methods (cs.GR) and utilizes a neural network module (cs.LG) for segmentation predictions. Additionally, the paper discusses the quantitative gains achieved on COCO and Cityscapes datasets, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence research (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the efficiency of the proposed method, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
