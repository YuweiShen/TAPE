This falls under the category of weak supervision, which is a subfield of machine learning. The paper specifically focuses on natural language processing and image classification tasks, which suggests cs.CL and cs.CV as likely sub-categories. The use of data programming, a recently proposed machine learning paradigm, suggests cs.LG and cs.AI as likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses modeling tradeoffs and an optimizer for automating tradeoff decisions, which suggests cs.DS as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
