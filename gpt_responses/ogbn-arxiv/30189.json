The use of structural position representations also involves modeling the latent structure of the input sentence, which could be relevant to the cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed approach could potentially be applied to other tasks beyond NLP, such as computer vision (cs.CV) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
