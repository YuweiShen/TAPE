Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and power minimization are used in the paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of cognitive radio and non-orthogonal multiple access in wireless communication systems. It also proposes a scheme for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on improving the security of a NOMA CRN using cooperative jamming and artificial noise. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates a power minimization problem and proposes a suboptimal scheme to solve it based on semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation. These techniques are commonly used in systems and control. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of non-orthogonal multiple access and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer can have implications for multimedia applications in wireless communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
