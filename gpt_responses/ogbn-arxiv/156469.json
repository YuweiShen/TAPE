This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which are commonly used in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IR, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
