The paper presents exact values of $LCD{[}n,k{]}$, which involves optimization and combinatorial algorithms (cs.CC). The paper also discusses bounds and inequalities on $LCD{[}n,k{]}$, which involves numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
