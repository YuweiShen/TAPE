The use of optimization algorithms and statistical analysis also suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.MM) subfields. Finally, the application of the proposed algorithms to human body shapes and brain structures indicates a potential overlap with the field of medical imaging (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
