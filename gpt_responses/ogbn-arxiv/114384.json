Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the potential multi-gigabit data rate given by the large amounts of available bandwidth, which is a topic related to multimedia systems and applications, making cs.MM (Multimedia) another likely category. Additionally, the paper discusses the sensitivity to blockage and the harsh propagation environment, which are topics related to wireless communication and signal processing, making cs.COMM (Communications) another likely category. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-offs related to the accuracy and simplicity of the channel model, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence and robotics, making cs.AR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
