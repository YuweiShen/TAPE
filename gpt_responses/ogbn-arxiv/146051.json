This makes cs.CC (Computational Complexity) the most likely sub-category, as OBDDs are often used in complexity theory. The paper also discusses the width of OBDDs, which is related to the space complexity of algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves the study of automata, which falls under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The use of affine transformations and probabilistic models suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as other possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
