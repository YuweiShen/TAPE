The proposed model involves training multiple classification functions with shared feature extraction, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The model also involves transferring knowledge from labeled to unlabeled classes, which is a key aspect of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves natural language processing, as it discusses label embedding representations, which is a common technique in computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves experiments on standard datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
