The paper also discusses active learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) that deals with selecting the most informative samples for labeling. The use of metadata as a similarity metric and context for each image is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the experiments involve classification performance, which is a common evaluation metric in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
