The paper also discusses the use of non-convex optimization methods derived from statistical physics, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of optimizing source-channel codes also has applications in control systems (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
