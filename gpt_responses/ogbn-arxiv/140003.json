The method relies on pre-trained embeddings of documents and sentences, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of the method through automatic and extrinsic evaluation, which involves measuring the performance of the method on a specific task, indicating the use of information retrieval (cs.IR) and software engineering (cs.SD) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
