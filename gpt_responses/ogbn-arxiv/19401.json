Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel LSTM-CNN hybrid network for trajectory prediction, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of horizon-based interactions to model driving behavior suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.RO (Robotics). The paper's focus on modeling interactions between different road-agents suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
