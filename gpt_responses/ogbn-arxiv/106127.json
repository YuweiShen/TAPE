The focus on bandwidth restrictions and the use of randomized and deterministic algorithms suggests that the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Algorithms (cs.AL) sub-categories may also be relevant. Finally, the use of tools such as bounded independence and conditional expectations suggests that the Network Information Theory (cs.NI) sub-category may also be applicable."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
