The use of semi-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled samples is a key aspect of the paper, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses loss functions and feature distributions, which are common topics in neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
