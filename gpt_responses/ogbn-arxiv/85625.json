The use of factor-graph based belief propagation algorithm and the simulation results in a V-BLAST system suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of a hybrid algorithm and the focus on performance improvement suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
