The proposed method involves modeling the high-level feature space and the output space to be mutually informative, and constraining feature vectors to lie in the modeled space during training. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
