Additionally, the paper discusses the use of lexical constraints in the decoding procedure, which is a common technique in NLP. The paper also mentions the use of human judgments to evaluate the quality of the paraphrases, which is a common practice in the field of NLP. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) because it uses a neural machine translation system to generate paraphrases, which is a common technique in AI. \n\nThe sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) is also likely because the paper discusses the training of a monolingual NMT model using ParaBank. \n\nThe sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) is possible because the paper uses a neural machine translation system to generate paraphrases. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR) is possible because the paper discusses the use of ParaBank for sentence rewriting tasks, which is a common task in information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
