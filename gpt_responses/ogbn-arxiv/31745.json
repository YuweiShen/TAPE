The proposed method involves convex optimization and joint spectral sparsity, which are techniques commonly used in information theory (cs.IT), computer vision (cs.CV), signal processing (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
