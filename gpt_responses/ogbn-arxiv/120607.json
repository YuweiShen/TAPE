It proposes a new method for constructing summary flow functions for procedures using a higher order reachability graph (HRG). This is a topic that falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. The paper also discusses empirical measurements and scalability, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
