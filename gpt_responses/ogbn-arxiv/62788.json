This involves extracting angle information and power angular spectrum (PAS) from the instantaneous uplink channel state information (CSI) to reconstruct the uplink/downlink channel covariance matrices (CCMs). The paper also discusses the applicability of the proposed strategy for any kind of PAS distributions and array geometries. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also deals with massive MIMO systems, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
