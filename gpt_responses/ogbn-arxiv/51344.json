This is a common problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The paper proposes a Bayesian aggregation method that uses latent variables to estimate the workers' completion time, the tasks' duration, and the workers' accuracy. This involves machine learning techniques such as message-passing Bayesian inference, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the problem of defining worker's bonuses, fair prices, and time limits of the tasks, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and social computing (cs.SI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
