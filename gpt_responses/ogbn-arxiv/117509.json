The paper also extends the approach to the temporally correlated multiple measurement vector (MMV) case, which falls under the category of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, making cs.MM a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper uses an algorithm that leverages the convergence properties of GGAMP, which is a type of iterative algorithm commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
