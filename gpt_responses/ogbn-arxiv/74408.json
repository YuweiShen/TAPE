The proposed architecture is a deep learning architecture, which involves supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, and is inspired by the divide and conquer principle, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the training of leaf level models, which involves the use of natural language processing techniques, which falls under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
