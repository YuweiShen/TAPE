Specifically, the paper proposes a method for joint neural architecture and hyperparameter search. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of the paper. The sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also possible since they deal with optimization and control, which are relevant to the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
