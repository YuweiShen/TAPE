The use of determinantal structure in the system also suggests the possibility of connections to linear algebra and matrix computations (cs.DS). The mention of polynomial optimization and the use of homotopy algorithms suggest a possible connection to control theory and dynamical systems (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
