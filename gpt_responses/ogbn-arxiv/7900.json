Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on image classification tasks, which suggests that it could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions different activation functions, which are a key component of neural networks and could be relevant to neural evolution (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
