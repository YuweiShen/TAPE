Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a learning-based frequency selection method, which involves analyzing the spectral bias from a frequency perspective. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper leverages identical structures of well-known neural networks, indicating that it may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to reducing input data size, which may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
