The paper specifically focuses on improving the speed and efficiency of object detection on embedded devices, which suggests that it may fall under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), or robotics (cs.RO). Among these categories, computer vision (cs.CV) is the most likely, as the paper deals with object detection in video, which is a common task in computer vision. Machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also likely categories, as the paper uses deep neural networks to achieve its results. Multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) are less likely but still possible categories, as the paper deals with real-time object detection in video and embedded systems, which could be relevant to these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
