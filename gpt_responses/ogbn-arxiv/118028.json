The evaluation of the designs is done through experiments, which may involve machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of open-loop grasps, which may involve control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the generic performance of the gripper designs, which may involve statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
