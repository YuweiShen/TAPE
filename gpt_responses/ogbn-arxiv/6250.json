This involves learning a regression model using a training dataset and formulating it as a convex optimization problem with a graph-Laplacian based regularization. The method is not restricted to functions of the graph adjacency/Laplacian matrix and can be used even when the underlying graph is not known apriori. The paper involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), signal processing (cs.SI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
