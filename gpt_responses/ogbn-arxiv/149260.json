The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The incorporation of local information and object proposals could also relate to multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
