The use of neural networks for object detection also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the fusion architectures in adverse weather conditions, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
