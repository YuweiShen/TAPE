This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). However, given that the paper focuses on developing an algorithm with PAC-style guarantees, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
