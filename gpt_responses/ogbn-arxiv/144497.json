The use of colored networks is a specific aspect of the problem, which could also place the paper in the Networked Systems (cs.NI) or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also involves algorithms and optimization, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
