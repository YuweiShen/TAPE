The paper also discusses crowdsourcing experiments and user studies, which fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of large-scale datasets and deep learning methods also suggests machine learning (cs.LG) as a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of natural images, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM), and the analysis of dataset diversity, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
