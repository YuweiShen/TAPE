The proposed method involves deep learning models, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of social tags for refining visual features suggests a possible connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). The title also mentions \"multi-modal\" and \"multi-scale\", which could indicate a focus on multimodal learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the issue of annotating images with an automatically-determined number of class labels, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
