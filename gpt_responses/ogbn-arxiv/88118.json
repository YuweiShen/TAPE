It introduces a modular approach that uses task-free intrinsically motivated exploration and unsupervised learning to build object-based models of the environment and action space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
