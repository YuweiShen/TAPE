This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) as the authors aim to maximize the number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) achieved in the network. The paper also discusses the network geometry and the use of generalized DoF, which could be relevant to the fields of networking (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper mentions Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) schemes, which are commonly used in wireless communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a CSI allocation policy that suggests an alternative to clustering, which could be of interest to the field of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
