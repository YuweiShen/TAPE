It also involves machine learning techniques such as decoupling detection and classification, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of position-sensitive filters for localization and the generalization of objectness to novel classes suggest that it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the mention of mAP and the performance increase with the number of training object classes suggest that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
