The paper proposes a weakly supervised approach that uses image labels instead of per-pixel saliency masks, which is a common problem in deep learning-based salient object detection. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. The proposed method involves training fully convolutional networks, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and image retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
