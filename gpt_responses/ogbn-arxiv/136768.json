The paper discusses the didactical motivation behind the tool and the techniques used to address issues on the syntactic as well as on the semantic level. The paper is likely to be classified under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) as it deals with formal logic and proofs. It could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the tool uses automated reasoning to help students find proofs. Additionally, it could be classified under cs.PL (Programming Languages) as the sequent calculus is used in the study of programming languages. It could also be classified under cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) as the tool is a new technology designed to aid in learning. Finally, it could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the sequent calculus is a fundamental concept in computer science and the tool aids in learning this concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
