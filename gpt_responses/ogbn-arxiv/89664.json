The paper also discusses collision avoidance and joint space smoothness costs, which are common topics in robotics.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The YCB dataset used in the experiments contains RGB-D images of objects, and the paper mentions using these images to estimate the object pose. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of object pose feedback to compensate for errors encountered during trajectory execution, which could involve computer vision techniques.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to in-grasp manipulation using kinematic trajectory optimization, which could be considered an AI technique. The paper also mentions the use of a signed distance cost function to avoid collisions with the environment, which could be considered a planning or decision-making task.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, kinematic trajectory optimization could be considered a type of optimization or learning algorithm.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of a feedback controller to compensate for errors encountered during trajectory execution, which is a common topic in systems and control.
