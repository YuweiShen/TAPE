The paper specifically focuses on using neural pruning and synaptic consolidation to overcome this problem, which are techniques commonly used in the sub-fields of \"Neural Network Pruning\" and \"Synaptic Consolidation\". Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
