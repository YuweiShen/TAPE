This topic is closely related to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and social networks (cs.SOC). The proposed framework, sNDN, leverages the Named Data Networking (NDN) principle, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also focuses on mobile multimedia contents, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper introduces a social-aware named data framework, which is related to social computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
