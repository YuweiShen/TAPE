The paper focuses on learning a good metric automatically from data, which is a common problem in the sub-categories of machine learning such as cs.LG and cs.AI. The proposed approach is based on pq-grams, which is a distance for ordered labeled trees, and has much lower computation cost than the tree edit distance. This makes the proposed approach suitable for big data analysis, which is a common problem in the sub-categories of data mining such as cs.DM. The paper also shows that the proposed approach achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art edit distance-based methods in various classification problems, which is a common problem in the sub-categories of information retrieval such as cs.IR and computer vision such as cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
