The paper also builds upon the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework, which is a popular technique in computer science for solving near neighbor problems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
