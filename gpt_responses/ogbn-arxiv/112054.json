The proposed method involves the use of a multiscale saliency refinement network, which is a type of machine learning algorithm (cs.AI) and the optimization framework used is based on maximum a posteriori estimation (cs.LG). The paper also involves the construction of a new database, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and the use of pixelwise annotations, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
