The use of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for similarity search suggests that this paper could also be categorized under data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the focus on image search engines and Content-Based Multimedia Retrieval (CBMR) suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the use of parallelization techniques and optimization strategies suggests that this paper could also be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
