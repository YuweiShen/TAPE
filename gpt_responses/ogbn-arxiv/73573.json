The system uses a pedestrian motion prediction model (PORCA) that accounts for both global navigation intention and local interactions, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The planning algorithm also uses a POMDP algorithm, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). Finally, the system is designed to ensure safe and efficient driving, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
