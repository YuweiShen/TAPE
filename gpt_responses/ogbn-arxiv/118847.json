This involves the use of data mining, theoretical modeling, and efficient computational intelligence mechanisms. The system is designed to be low-cost and applicable in real-world scenarios. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
