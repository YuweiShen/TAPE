The use of random matrix theory and the concept of freeness suggests that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical theory (cs.ST). The application of the approach to signal recovery in compressed sensing suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
