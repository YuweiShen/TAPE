This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories related to cryptography (cs.CR), databases (cs.DB), data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and software engineering (cs.SE) for implementing the proposed solution. However, given the focus on cryptographic techniques and security, cs.CR is the most likely category, followed by cs.DB and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
