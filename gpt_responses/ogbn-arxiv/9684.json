It also involves the study of assemblies of neurons, which falls under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE) and computational neuroscience (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses techniques from discrete mathematics (cs.DS) to analyze the perturbation models used in the tensor decomposition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
