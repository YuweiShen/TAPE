The use of circulant and quadratic double circulant constructions suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also involves the discovery of new codes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The codes are constructed using extension theorems, which is a technique in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves computations and tabulations, which suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
