This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed matcher involves learning a weight matrix to obtain global matching identities and scores of all the patches. This indicates the use of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely category.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with face recognition, which is a multimedia application. Hence, cs.MM is a possible category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed matcher involves learning correlations between different facial patches, which is a key aspect of artificial intelligence. Hence, cs.AI is a possible category.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper involves evaluating the performance of the proposed matcher on face recognition datasets, which may involve security and privacy concerns. Hence, cs.CR is a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
