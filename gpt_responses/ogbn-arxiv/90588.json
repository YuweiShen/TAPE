This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the allocation of resources in a communication system, which involves optimizing the use of available resources to maximize the system performance. This is a key area of information theory. \n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper proposes a resource allocation scheme for a communication system, which involves managing interference and allocating resources among users. This falls under the domain of communications and networking. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with visible light communication, which is a form of multimedia communication. The proposed resource allocation scheme aims to improve the area spectral efficiency and fairness level in a multi-user VLC system. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a resource allocation scheme for a system that involves managing interference and allocating resources among users.
