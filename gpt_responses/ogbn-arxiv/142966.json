Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves combinatorial designs and constructions, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper discusses the properties of propelinear codes, which could place it in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Hadamard codes, which could also place it in cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
