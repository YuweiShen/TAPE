The use of algebraic function fields suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper mentions applications to hitting sets and cover-free families, which are topics in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
