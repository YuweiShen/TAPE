The paper also mentions document processing and retrieval, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of computational power and machine learning for character recognition suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
