The paper specifically focuses on dynamically growing databases, which suggests that the sub-categories of databases and data structures and algorithms are particularly relevant. However, the use of machine learning and differential privacy techniques also makes the sub-categories of machine learning and cryptography likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
