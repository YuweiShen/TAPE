The use of a public helper and the consideration of information leakage also suggest a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and security and privacy (cs.SI) subfields. Finally, the paper may also touch upon aspects of communication complexity (cs.CC) due to the triangular source coding scenario."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
