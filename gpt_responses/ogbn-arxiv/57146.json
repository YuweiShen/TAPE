The algorithm's performance is evaluated using numerical examples, which suggests that it may fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or signal processing (cs.IT). Finally, the paper's focus on computational efficiency and performance suggests that it may also belong to scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
