The use of deep learning for control flow integrity checking suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions issues related to modifying binaries and compilers, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the technique involves splitting the control flow graph into chains, which suggests a focus on programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
