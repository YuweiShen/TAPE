This involves the analysis of the density of active LWPA-mode WiFi APs in the network, which can be categorized under network modeling and analysis (cs.NI). The paper also considers the DL data rate and area spectral efficiency (ASE) improvement, which can be related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the security aspects of LWPA networks, which can be categorized under cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a practical model for determining the conditions under which a native WLAN Access Point (AP) will work under LWPA mode, which can be related to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
