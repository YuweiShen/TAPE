The paper proposes a language-independent framework for parallel corpus mining, which involves techniques such as machine translation and cosine similarity over continuous-space sentence representations. These techniques are commonly used in NLP and are closely related to the sub-categories of arXiv CS. Specifically, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category as it deals with NLP tasks such as machine translation and parallel corpora. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also relevant as the paper discusses techniques for mining publicly available lectures. cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are relevant as the paper proposes a multistage fine-tuning approach for improving translation quality, which involves machine learning techniques. Finally, cs.DL (Deep Learning) is also relevant as the paper mentions the use of continuous-space sentence representations, which are commonly used in deep learning models for NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
