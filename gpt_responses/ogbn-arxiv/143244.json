This falls under the category of computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses continuous-time models of computation, which could fall under the categories of dynamical systems (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
