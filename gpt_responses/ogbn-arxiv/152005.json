The approach presented in the paper involves building a model of normal behavior based on historical login activity, which is then used to identify anomalous logins. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization and graph analysis, which are commonly used in the fields of cybersecurity (cs.CR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with network security (cs.NI) and anomaly detection (cs.SI), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
