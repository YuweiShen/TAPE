The use of deep learning in the design of these codes makes it likely that the paper also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of recurrent neural networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). The integration of information-theoretic insights with deep learning techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) since reliable communication is important in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
