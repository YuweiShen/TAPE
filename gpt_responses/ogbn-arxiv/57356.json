The use of Web search engines for obtaining images suggests a focus on large-scale data mining and machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm proposed in the paper involves learning and representation of semantic concepts, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of non-semantic mid-level anchors and the soft induction of geometric relationships suggest a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with visual navigation and exploration of learned concepts, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
