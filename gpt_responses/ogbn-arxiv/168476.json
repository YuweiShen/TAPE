The paper discusses the state-of-the-art Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) active learner and proposes a new and looser bound called the Nuclear Discrepancy bound. The paper also presents empirical results to support their argument. Given the focus on machine learning and optimization, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
