Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with NLP and ML for text processing. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to extract relevant information from scientific articles, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of various models for the task, including heuristic (rule-based) approaches and attentive neural architectures, suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves the use of a corpus and evaluation metrics, which may make cs.CY (Computers and Society) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
