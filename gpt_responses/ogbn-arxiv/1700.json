The use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding policy suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The consideration of quality of service (QoS) requirements and the optimization of power allocation and rate allocation suggest that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of multicarrier communication and the comparison with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes suggest that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques and the branch-and-bound approach suggest that the paper may also belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
