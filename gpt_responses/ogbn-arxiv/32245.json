The use of multiple lossy compressions on images is also a key aspect of the paper, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR). The optimization of different aspects of the system, such as depth of CNN and execution time, could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) or cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
