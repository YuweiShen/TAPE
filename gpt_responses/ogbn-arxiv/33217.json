This is a central topic in computational complexity theory and hence, this category is likely.\n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the representation of terms as graphs rather than trees, which involves the use of data structures. This could potentially fall under this category.\n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with the representation of terms as graphs rather than trees, which is a common technique used in programming languages.
