This involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which are typically covered under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning models for pest detection also falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of parallel hardware for real-time performance, which could be related to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning models for pest detection could also be related to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
