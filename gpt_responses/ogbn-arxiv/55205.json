This involves the use of advanced transmit and receive strategies to remove inter-symbol interference and harvest both multi-path and multi-user diversity. These concepts are closely related to information theory, making cs.IT a likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a challenging communication scenario where users have heterogeneous mobility profiles. This involves the design of efficient communication protocols that can handle such scenarios. This makes cs.NI a likely category for this paper.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a new communication protocol that can handle heterogeneous user mobility profiles. This involves the use of advanced techniques such as NOMA and OTFS modulation. These concepts are closely related to communication and networking, making cs.COMM a likely category for this paper.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new communication protocol that involves the use of advanced transmit and receive strategies to remove inter-symbol interference and harvest both multi-path and multi-user diversity.
