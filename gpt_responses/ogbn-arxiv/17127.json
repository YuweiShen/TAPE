Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization and algorithm design, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper utilizes physical layer principles of wireless communication systems, which could place it in cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
