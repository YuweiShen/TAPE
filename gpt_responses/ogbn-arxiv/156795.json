The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for training object detectors, which involves designing a new network architecture, and this falls under neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
