The paper discusses the use of interval bound propagation (IBP) to achieve this goal. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the security aspect of the trained models, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for training verifiably robust models, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
