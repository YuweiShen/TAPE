Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also mentions the use of Transfer Learning, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on automation and reducing repetitive tasks suggests a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the interaction with users and potential benefits for workers suggest a fit with cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the use of structured and labeled training data suggests a possible fit with cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
