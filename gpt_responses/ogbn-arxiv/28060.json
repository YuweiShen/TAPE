This problem is relevant to several fields, including bioinformatics and neuroimaging, and is related to topics such as machine learning, data mining, and statistics. The paper proposes a novel approach, SIMULE, to learn multi-UGM via a constrained L1 minimization. The approach can handle both Gaussian and Nonparanormal data, which relaxes the normality assumption that many real-world applications do not follow. The paper provides a theoretical proof of the consistency of the proposed approach. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
