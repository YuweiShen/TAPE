This topic is closely related to logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL), as well as software engineering (cs.SE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) due to the strong automation and help with shaping proofs. The paper also mentions the use of a controlled natural language, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
