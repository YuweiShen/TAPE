The use of Shannon's entropy of information as a tool for keyword extraction suggests that this paper belongs to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The information retrieval aspect of the problem also suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of statistical methods for analyzing the distribution of words in texts suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the comparison with other proposals in the literature and the use of a representative text sample suggest that it could also belong to the sub-category of deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
