The use of weakly-supervised learning methods also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges related to the nature and availability of labeled histology images, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
