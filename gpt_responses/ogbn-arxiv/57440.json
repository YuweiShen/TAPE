The paper proposes a new optimization procedure for neural network training, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves introducing confusion in activations, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates its method on various datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
