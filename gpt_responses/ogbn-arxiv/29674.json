This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves financial modeling and time series analysis, which could place it in the computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories.
