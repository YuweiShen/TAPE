The paper proposes a new approach to identifying and eliminating mislabeled training instances using a set of learning algorithms as noise filters. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information retrieval (cs.IR). However, given the focus on improving classification accuracy through filtering, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CV, cs.DS, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
