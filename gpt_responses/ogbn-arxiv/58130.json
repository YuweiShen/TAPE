It also uses tools from stochastic calculus to enhance our understanding of these channels, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of feedback in these channels, which is relevant to networking and communication (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the impact of feedback on capacity regions, which involves modeling and simulation (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
