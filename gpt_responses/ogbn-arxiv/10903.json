Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a neural network as a function approximator, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of curriculum transfer learning and parameter sharing multi-agent gradient descent Sarsa({\\lambda}) algorithm indicates that it may also belong to the sub-categories of game theory (cs.GT) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with the coordination of multiple units, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
