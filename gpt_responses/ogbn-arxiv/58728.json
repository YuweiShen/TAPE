The proposed method involves feature extraction using optical flow, which is a common technique in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the limitations of conventional approaches and proposes a new method, which involves selecting only two frames per video, indicating a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also involves machine learning techniques for recognition, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves experiments on micro-expression databases, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
