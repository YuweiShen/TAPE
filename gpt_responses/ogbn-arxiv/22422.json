The paper proposes a new approach for learning initiation sets for options, which involves defining an interest function associated with an option and using it for general function approximation. This approach is based on gradient-based learning algorithms and is applicable to both discrete and continuous environments. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques for interpreting and reusing temporal abstractions, which makes cs.CL (Computation and Language) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also deals with control systems and decision-making, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
