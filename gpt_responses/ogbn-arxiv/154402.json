This involves a hybrid analog-and-digital spatial filtering at each RRH, which is optimized using an online algorithm. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the compression of data over fronthaul links, which is a topic related to information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN), which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an optimization algorithm for the hybrid analog-and-digital spatial filtering, which is a topic related to systems and control. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of multimedia data over fronthaul links, which is a topic related to multimedia. \n- cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not seem to be related to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
