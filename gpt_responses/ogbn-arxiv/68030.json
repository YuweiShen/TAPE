The use of anti-concentration bounds and scalar products suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The mention of nearest neighbor search and high dimensional space suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the mention of the Hamming distance suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
