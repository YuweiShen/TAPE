This makes the most likely category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the issue of packet reordering, which is a security concern, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely category. The use of SDN also makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible category. The paper also discusses the performance improvement achieved through multipath scheduling algorithms, which falls under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Finally, the paper compares its approach to Multipath TCP, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
