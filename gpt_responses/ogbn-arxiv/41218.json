The paper also discusses the use of a generic framework based on improved repeatability measure, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the behavior of detectors under different conditions, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
