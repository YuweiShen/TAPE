Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses convolutional neural networks, which are a popular tool in deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with text recognition, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper uses a YOLO-inspired architecture, which is a popular object detection algorithm, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
