The paper describes the creation of two new datasets with images described by humans, which involves both NLP and CV techniques. The use of Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform, also suggests a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aspect to the research, which falls under the cs.HC sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques in analyzing the properties of the datasets. Finally, the use of clipart objects in one of the datasets suggests a Multimedia (MM) aspect to the research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
