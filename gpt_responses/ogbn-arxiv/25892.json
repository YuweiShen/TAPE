The paper focuses on the use of one-class learners to recognize patterns of remote exfiltration occurring over days to weeks. The paper also discusses the use of normal traffic flow data to train an ensemble of classifiers, which are modular and trained on different traffic features thought to characterize malicious data transfers. The paper uses features that model the egress to ingress byte balance over time, periodicity, short timescale irregularity, and density of the traffic. The features are most efficiently modeled in the frequency domain. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
