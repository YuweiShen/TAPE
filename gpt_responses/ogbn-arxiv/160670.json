This is a typical topic in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Although the paper does not deal with geometric objects, the problem of finding proper orientations can be seen as a geometric problem, where the goal is to assign directions to edges in a way that avoids cycles. Therefore, this paper could be relevant to researchers in computational geometry.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the weighted proper orientation problem, which is a typical topic in computational complexity theory.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with a graph problem that involves assigning weights to edges, which is a typical topic in game theory. Moreover, the paper discusses the concept of Nash equilibria, which is a central concept in game theory.
