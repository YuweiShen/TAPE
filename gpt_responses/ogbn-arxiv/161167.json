Information theory is concerned with the quantification, storage, and communication of information, which is relevant to the topic of denoising. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed family of denoisers may involve machine learning techniques, such as training on a dataset of noisy and clean signals. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - While the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the topic of denoising can be relevant to networked systems where signals are transmitted over noisy channels. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper mentions that the proposed denoising schemes can be implemented computationally efficiently, which is a topic of interest in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with denoising of discrete signals, which can be relevant to multimedia applications such as image or audio processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
