This work falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with machine learning techniques for knowledge representation. The use of hypercomplex representations also suggests a focus on geometric and algebraic structures, which aligns with the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also mentions the use of embeddings for natural language processing tasks, indicating a potential connection to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on knowledge graph completion benchmarks, which falls under the sub-category of databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
