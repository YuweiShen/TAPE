The use of channel inversion power control is a technique commonly used in wireless networks, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture community (cs.NI). The paper also examines the impact of noise uncertainty and full-duplex receivers on the performance of covert communications, which may be of interest to researchers working on multimedia systems (cs.MM) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
