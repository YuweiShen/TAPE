Additionally, the paper discusses the use of activation functions, which is a common topic in machine learning and falls under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of the technique for non-Markovian double pole balancing, which is a task commonly studied in the field of robotics and control systems, falling under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for further exploration of automatic model selection for artificial neural networks, which is a topic commonly studied in computer vision, falling under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
