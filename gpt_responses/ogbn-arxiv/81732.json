The use of a jammer and the consideration of a maximum probability of error criterion suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.CR). The lack of private randomness between the transmitter and receiver may make the paper relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the use of stochastic codes may make the paper relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM), as stochastic coding is often used in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
