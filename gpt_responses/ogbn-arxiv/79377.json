However, the paper also connects this topic to quantum computation and geometric complexity theory, which suggests a potential connection to quantum computing and computational complexity theory. Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.QC (Quantum Computing) are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the study of composition of polynomials, which suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and algebraic algorithms, making cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper involves the study of families of symmetric polynomials, which suggests a connection to combinatorics and discrete mathematics, making cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
