It could also belong to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) because of the use of machine learning techniques to extract and represent knowledge. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category because of the focus on extracting knowledge from large-scale textual data.
