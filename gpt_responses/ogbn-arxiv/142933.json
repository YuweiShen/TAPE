This involves coordination between layers to avoid channel conflict and time-multiplexing the IOs. The paper focuses on the design and implementation of this architecture, making it likely to fall under the categories of cs.AR (Architecture), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.ET (Embedded Systems), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
