The study also involves evaluating the performance of different models on large-scale datasets, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the effects of covariates on face verification, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
