Therefore, cs.SD (Sound) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes to use transfer learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning and falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper experiments with different transfer methods, which involves training multiple models simultaneously, making it relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper uses artist-related information to improve genre classification, which can be seen as a form of feature engineering and falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
