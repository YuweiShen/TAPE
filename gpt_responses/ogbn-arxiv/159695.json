This problem has applications in cancer diagnosis and involves minimizing the border length between adjacent peptides. The paper presents a hierarchical refinement algorithm to improve the yield of microarray fabrication and proves that the Border Length Minimization Problem (BLMP) is NP-hard. The problem has connections to discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), algorithms and complexity (cs.CC), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
