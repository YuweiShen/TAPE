Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP. The second likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deals with image processing and analysis. The third likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with learning algorithms. The fourth likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which deals with intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
