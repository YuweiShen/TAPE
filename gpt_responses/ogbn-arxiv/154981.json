This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions the use of the proposed algorithm in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can be considered as a type of network. Hence, cs.SI is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for decoding and discusses its complexity. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of the proposed algorithm for soft-output decoding, which is a common technique in machine learning. Hence, cs.LG is a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper mentions the use of the proposed algorithm in MIMO systems, which are commonly used in networking and internet architecture.
