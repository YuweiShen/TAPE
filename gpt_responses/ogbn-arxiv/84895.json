It also involves information theory (cs.IT) as the algorithms aim to maximize video streaming quality subject to queue stability. The use of 4K UHD video traces suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the performance improvements with the stochastic video streaming algorithms suggest control systems (cs.SY) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
