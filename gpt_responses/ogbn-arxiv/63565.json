This involves capturing different aspects of similarity between entities using multiple features, integrating them at outcome-level with dynamically assigned weights, and formulating entity alignment as a stable matching problem. This work involves techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) for embedding-based methods, database (DB) for knowledge graph construction and integration, computational linguistics (CL) for cross-lingual entity alignment, machine learning (LG) for feature fusion, and information retrieval (IR) for similarity measures. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.DB, cs.CL, cs.LG, and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
