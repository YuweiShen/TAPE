This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of DNNs for classification also falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of multispectral data, which falls under the domain of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for smart cameras to be used for preemptive actions, which falls under the domain of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
