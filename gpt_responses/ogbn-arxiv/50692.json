These techniques are commonly used in machine learning. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for hyperspectral unmixing, which involves constructing hyperplanes from data pixels. This is a problem in computational geometry, which is closely related to data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the Craig criterion for hyperspectral unmixing, which is based on information theory principles. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which involves avoiding heavy simplex volume computations. This is a problem in numerical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
