This involves converting volumetric representations into graphs, developing nomenclature rules, and learning feature embeddings for shape manipulation. This work is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves 3D shape analysis and retrieval, as well as machine learning (cs.NE, cs.LG, cs.AI) as it involves developing feature embeddings. Additionally, the use of graphs and topology may also make this work relevant to graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
