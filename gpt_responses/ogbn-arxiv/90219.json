It investigates the joint consideration of channel coding, secrecy coding, and retransmission protocols to ensure both reliability and confidentiality of secure HARQ protocols. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with the issue of secure communication in the presence of a passive eavesdropper who intercepts the transmissions through an independent block-fading channel. It studies the error and secrecy performance of different retransmission protocols to ensure that the confidential message is decoded successfully by the legitimate receiver and is kept completely secret from the eavesdropper. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the throughput of secure HARQ protocols for block-fading channels, which is a key performance metric in networking and internet architecture. It derives an achievable throughput for a given connection/secrecy outage probability pair and demonstrates the benefits of HARQ protocols to throughput and secrecy through both asymptotic analysis and numerical calculations. \n4. cs.SI (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the design and analysis of secure HARQ protocols, which can be viewed as a control problem in the context of communication systems. It investigates the tradeoff between the reliability of the legitimate communication link and the confidentiality with"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
