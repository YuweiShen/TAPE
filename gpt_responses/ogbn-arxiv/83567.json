The use of deep neural networks for feature learning also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the processing and analysis of multimedia data, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
