The paper proposes a new way of training prototypical few-shot models for a single class, which involves introducing a null class and enforcing centering with batch normalization. The paper also proposes a novel Gaussian layer for distance calculation in a prototypical network. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
