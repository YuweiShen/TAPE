This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms to manage the storage and retrieval of data. \n- cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper addresses the critical issue of scaling up backup storage for virtualization environments, which is a key concern for operating systems that rely on virtualization. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with the storage and retrieval of large volumes of data, which is a core concern of database systems. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the performance implications of deduplication on read operations, which is relevant to hardware architecture design. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new system for managing backup storage, which falls under the category of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
