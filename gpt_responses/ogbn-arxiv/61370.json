It proposes a novel system that uses physical properties of wireless signals and the effect of human bodies on their propagation to automatically deauthenticate users. This makes it likely to belong to the categories of computer security (cs.CR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, which involves extensive experiments, making it relevant to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the system is designed to be unobtrusive and can be used in shared office settings, which makes it relevant to the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
