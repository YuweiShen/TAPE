The paper discusses different input representations for this problem, including multi-view snapshots and spherical representations. These representations are used to capture different aspects of the object information. The paper also discusses the trade-offs between these representations and how accuracy varies along the continuum. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.GR (Graphics), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
