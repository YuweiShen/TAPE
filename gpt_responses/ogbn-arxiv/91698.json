The use of occupancy grid maps and ray casting suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) may also be relevant sub-categories. The use of a particle filter for localization suggests machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant. Finally, the fact that the algorithm is designed to run on resource-constrained mobile robots suggests systems and control (cs.SY) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
