This is a common topic in the machine learning community, particularly in the sub-fields of deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and statistical learning (cs.SD). The use of invertible transformations (i.e. normalizing flows) is also a popular technique in deep learning, which further supports the likelihood of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
