Additionally, the paper focuses on the application of semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel augmentation method to improve the accuracy and robustness of the semantic segmentation model, which could be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with fisheye images, which are a type of distorted images, and hence could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
