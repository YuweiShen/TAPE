The authors provide a direct information-theoretic analysis of the problem using linear programs, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also involves the study of graphs and their properties, which could place it in the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses algorithmic techniques to compute the broadcast rate, which could make it relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
