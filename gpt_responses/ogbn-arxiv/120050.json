The paper also discusses the compression ratio and time complexity, which are related to complexity theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses experimental results to compare different trie data structures, which can be considered as a machine learning (cs.LG) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
