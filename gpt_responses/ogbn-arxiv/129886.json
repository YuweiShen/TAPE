The method involves transforming entities and relations into continuous vector space, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods in characterizing the knowledge graph, which is related to database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on link prediction tasks, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
