It also uses concepts from discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC) to prove its results. The use of hypercontractive inequalities suggests a connection to the study of concentration of measure, which is a topic in probability theory and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study of sets of a given cardinality suggests a connection to combinatorics (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
