The paper specifically focuses on using Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a differentiable policy class, which is a technique that is commonly used in control systems and robotics research (cs.RO, cs.SY), but also involves differentiating through a convex approximation using KKT conditions, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.RO, and cs.SY, followed by cs.AI and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
