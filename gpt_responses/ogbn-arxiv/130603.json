Additionally, it may also belong to \"cs.NI\" (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it deals with network flow characteristics. The use of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and ensemble learning frameworks suggests that it may also belong to \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) and \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on early detection and the use of sliding window mechanism suggests that it may also belong to \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
