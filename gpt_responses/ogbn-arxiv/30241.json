The authors propose a semantic-guided approach that leverages a knowledge graph embedding model to evaluate the match's quality, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the response time optimization, which is a crucial issue in information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed A* semantic search algorithm involves heuristic estimation, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the trade-off between effectiveness and response time, which is a typical problem in systems and information science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
