It also involves the use of non-deterministic finite state transducers (NFT), which is a common tool in the study of automata and formal languages (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the decidability of certain properties, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper involves the construction of finite sets, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper deals with the study of functions and their realisation, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
