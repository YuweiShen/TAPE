The proposed solutions involve hierarchical pilot reuse methods, which can be considered as a form of system optimization (cs.SI). The paper also focuses on the performance of the system in terms of net throughput and sum-rate, which are metrics commonly used in the context of massive MIMO (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of pilot reuse on the overall communication system, which can be seen as a topic related to communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
