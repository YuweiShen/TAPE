Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new uncertainty-based active learning method, which involves selecting images with more information for annotation. This method involves analyzing objects' classification uncertainty and regression uncertainty, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper experiments with a specific object detector (CenterNet), which could suggest that it belongs to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
