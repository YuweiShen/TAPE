The use of $q$-ary lattices in cryptography is specifically mentioned as a motivation for the work. The paper also involves algebraic structures and operations, which could fall under the categories of coding theory (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the constructions in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
