Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses techniques for improving the language-agnostic nature of the model, which involves training a more robust encoder, and generating synthetic data. These techniques are related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), which are covered in sub-categories cs.LG (Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of cross-lingual word embeddings, which are commonly used in computer vision (CV) tasks as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
