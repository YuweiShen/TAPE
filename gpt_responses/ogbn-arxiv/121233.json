The paper specifically focuses on massive MIMO systems, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.MM) that deals with large-scale antenna arrays. Finally, the paper presents new bounds on the extreme eigenvalues of the spatial correlation matrix, which is a topic that falls under linear algebra (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
