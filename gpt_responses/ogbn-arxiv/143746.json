This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with social recommender systems, which involve user-user social graphs and user-item graphs. This falls under the domain of social and information networks.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with recommendations, which is a subfield of information retrieval. \n- cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper deals with social recommender systems, which is a topic of interest in computational social science.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with natural language processing in the context of social recommendations, where opinions associated with interactions need to be captured.
