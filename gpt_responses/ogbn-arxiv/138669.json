This problem is closely related to information theory and communication systems, hence the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method to 64-QAM in AWGN, which falls under the sub-category cs.COMM (Communication and Networking). The paper involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could also place it under cs.SI (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper presents numerical results and comparisons with existing methods, which could also make it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
