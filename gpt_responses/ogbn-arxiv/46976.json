The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper is focused on serving ML models and optimizing their performance. The second likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as the system is designed to be flexible and scalable for large-scale deployments. The third likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering), as the paper discusses the design and implementation of the system. The fourth likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as the paper discusses the optimization of model lookup and inference. The fifth likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), as the system can be used to serve ML models for image and video processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
