The paper discusses how to support taxonomists in improving SKOS vocabularies by pointing out quality issues that go beyond the integrity constraints defined in the SKOS specification. This involves identifying potential quantifiable quality issues and formalizing them into computable quality checking functions that can find affected resources in a given SKOS vocabulary. The paper then presents the qSKOS quality assessment tool, which implements these functions and analyzes 15 existing vocabularies, finding possible quality issues in all of them. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Deep Learning (cs.DL), and Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
