This problem is typically studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), cryptography and security (cs.CR), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a novel approach to distributed spectrum sensing using sequential detection, which is a statistical inference technique that can be applied in various domains. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.CR, cs.SY, and cs.MM, in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
