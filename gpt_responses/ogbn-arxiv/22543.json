The paper also proposes a generalized random utility model, which is a machine learning approach commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical inference (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the representation of variance in population preferences and imperfect perception, which is a topic in social computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper compares classical statistical ranking models to the proposed model, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
