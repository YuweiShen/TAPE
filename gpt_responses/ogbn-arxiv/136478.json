Additionally, the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) features is a common technique in computer vision research. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.AI) as it utilizes a pre-trained DCNN model to extract features. The focus on efficiency in processing high-resolution images suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of image features suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
