The use of spatio-temporal features like wind direction and wind speed suggests the involvement of computer vision techniques. The paper also mentions the use of LSTM, which is a popular deep learning model for sequence prediction, indicating the involvement of natural language processing techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CV. The use of Gradient Boosted Regression Trees and Feed Forward Neural Networks also suggests the involvement of neural networks, making cs.NE a likely sub-category. Finally, the mention of spatio-temporal features suggests the involvement of spatial information processing, making cs.SI a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
