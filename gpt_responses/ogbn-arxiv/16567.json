Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since the proposed algorithm is related to neural networks. Additionally, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) could also be possible sub-categories since the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed algorithm in mobile and embedded systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
