This involves addressing communication and comprehension challenges using semantic technologies. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of semantic technologies to develop a digital representation of information suggests an AI-related approach. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a digital representation for Industry 4.0 components, which is a software engineering challenge. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The use of RDF, RDF Schema and OWL suggests a database-related approach to knowledge representation. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper may involve the development of new programming languages or extensions to existing ones to support semantic knowledge representation. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of semantic technologies may involve machine learning techniques for data analysis and processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
