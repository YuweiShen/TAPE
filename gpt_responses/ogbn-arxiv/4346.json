This involves various computer vision techniques such as segmentation, stereo matching, and rendering. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper focuses on visualizing the reconstructed model in a HoloLens based AR system, which involves graphics techniques such as rendering and visualization. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with processing and visualizing medical data, which can be considered as a form of multimedia. \n4. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine scheme for stereo matching, which involves mathematical algorithms such as affine transform, Hungarian algorithm, and Gaussian regression. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves numerical techniques such as Markov Random Field and entropy-based post-processing for segmentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
