It also involves algebraic constructions of codes, which could fall under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) or distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the difficulty of designing codes for the deletion channel, which could be considered a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper provides an implementation of codes, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
