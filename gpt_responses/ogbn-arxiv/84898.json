The extension proposed in the paper involves attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) also suggests a potential fit for the neural networks (cs.NE) category. Finally, the application of the algorithm to Atari games suggests a potential fit for robotics (cs.RO) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
