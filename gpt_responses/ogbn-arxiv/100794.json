The method relies on hashing techniques, which are often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for efficient search and retrieval. The paper also explores different hashing strategies, which could be of interest to researchers in graphics (cs.GR) who work on efficient representation and matching of 3D models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
