Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel framework for joint learning, which involves machine learning (ML) techniques. Hence, cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with video processing, which falls under multimedia (MM) and robotics (RO) domains. Therefore, cs.MM and cs.RO are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
