It could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category as reinforcement learning is a subfield of AI. The paper also discusses the use of baselines in reinforcement learning, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a modification to the value function parameterization, which is a common technique in machine learning, and could also be relevant to the multi-agent systems (cs.MA) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
