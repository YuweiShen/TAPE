The authors propose a policy that maximizes the long-term welfare of a population of agents, which involves optimizing a budget-reward tradeoff (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of convex optimization to derive the optimal policy, which is a common technique in data science (cs.DS) and economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
