This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), which are covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category as it specifically deals with NLP and includes topics such as text classification and sentiment analysis. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely as they cover broader topics related to ML and NLP. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are less likely but still possible as they cover topics related to social media analysis and text retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
