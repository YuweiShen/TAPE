It also discusses the current techniques for HRL policy optimization and proposes a new method to achieve superior results in a set of difficult long time horizon tasks. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper deals with reinforcement learning, cs.RO (Robotics) as the proposed algorithm can be applied to robotics, cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it discusses the credit assignment problem in HRL, and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) as it deals with cooperation between internal agents in a hierarchy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
