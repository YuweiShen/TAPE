The use of fast Fourier transform (FFT) in previous algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.IT (information theory). The use of matrix multiplication and streaming algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.CC (computational complexity) or cs.CG (computational geometry). Finally, the focus on approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to cs.DM (discrete mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
