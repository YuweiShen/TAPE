The paper also discusses the decision version of the problem, which is a common topic in complexity theory. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are likely sub-categories. The problem also involves strings and sequences, which are common topics in computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
