The use of deep neural networks for these tasks suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The optimization of optics for depth estimation and object detection could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the use of an end-to-end design approach could also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
