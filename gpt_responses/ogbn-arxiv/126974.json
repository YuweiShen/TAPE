The paper proposes a formal definition of computational irreducibility and applies it to cellular automata and computable functions. This makes it likely to belong to the categories of cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
