Additionally, the paper discusses the ability of people to learn and generalize new concepts, which is a key area of research in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also includes experiments that involve image recognition, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category.
