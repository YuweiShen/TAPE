The paper also presents a new upper bound on the number of maximal equal-letter runs in the BWT, which has implications for the space complexity of BWT-based indexes, making it relevant to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from machine learning and statistics, making it relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG), and it presents algorithms for solving fundamental text processing tasks, making it relevant to the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
