The paper also introduces a novel similarity metric and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the metric over the model space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Graphics (cs.GR), Computational Geometry (cs.CG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
