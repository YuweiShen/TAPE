Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), which are covered by cs.CL and cs.IR respectively. The paper also mentions advancements in representation learning, which is a topic covered by cs.AI. Additionally, the paper proposes a pipeline system for MRS, which involves designing neural retrieval modules, a topic covered by cs.LG. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed system on fact verification and open-domain multihop QA, which are tasks related to machine learning and neural networks, covered by cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
