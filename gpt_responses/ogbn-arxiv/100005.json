The proposed technique involves the combination of Batch Normalization and Dropout, which are widely used techniques in deep learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
