The paper also discusses the complexity of these problems on graphs of bounded bandwidth, degeneracy, treewidth, and nowhere-dense graphs, which are important concepts in graph theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
