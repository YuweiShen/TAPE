Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of hyperparameters to improve the performance of models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of word embeddings in computer vision tasks, which could potentially place it in the cs.CV category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
