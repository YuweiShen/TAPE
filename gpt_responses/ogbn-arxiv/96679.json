The paper discusses the use of probabilistic models of text and the sublinear time sparse stochastic variational inference (SSVI) scheme applied to RelLDA. These topics are closely related to natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), information retrieval (IR), artificial intelligence (AI), and data structures (DS). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
