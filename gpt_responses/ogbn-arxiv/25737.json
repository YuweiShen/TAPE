The use of active learning and the focus on indirect samples suggest that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of information theory and the study of lower bounds on estimation error suggest that cs.IT (Information Theory) is also a likely category. The focus on discrete random variables and the use of combinatorial methods suggest that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) may also be a relevant category. Finally, the real-world applications of the problem suggest that cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) may also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
