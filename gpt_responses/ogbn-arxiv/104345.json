This involves several stages such as document acquisition and filtering, payload extraction, recipe step extraction, recipe assembly, and presentation through an information retrieval interface with question answering functionality. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning approaches for various subtasks such as step classification, feature extraction, document filtering and classification, text payload extraction, and multi-step assembly. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
