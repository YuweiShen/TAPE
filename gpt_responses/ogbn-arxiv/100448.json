The paper also discusses the need for robustness against attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new mechanism for adversarial defense, which involves training a model with limited data, which is a problem commonly studied in the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
