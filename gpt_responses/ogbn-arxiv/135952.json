The approach proposed in the paper involves using vision-based localization (cs.CV) and a sequential Monte Carlo estimator (cs.LG) to improve efficiency. The use of multi-modal sensory data also involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and has potential applications in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
