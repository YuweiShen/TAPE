The paper proposes a method for selecting from a large space of matrix decomposition models using a context-free grammar and a small toolbox of reusable algorithms. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
