This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The use of neural networks also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The dataset used in the paper is composed of aerial images, which could fall under the graphics (cs.GR) category. Finally, the proposed architectures could also be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) category, as they could be used for autonomous navigation and mapping."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
