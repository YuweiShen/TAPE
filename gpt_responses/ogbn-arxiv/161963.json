The proposed method involves constructing a stratified meta structure, which is a technique used in network analysis and graph theory (cs.SI). The method also involves defining a commuting matrix, which is a concept used in linear algebra and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using experiments on real-world datasets, which is a common practice in database research (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
