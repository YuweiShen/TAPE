The paper also discusses fairness metrics and regularization methods, which are common topics in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper analyzes biases in language models, which could potentially fall under the cs.CY (Computers and Society) sub-category.
