The algorithm is designed to solve the disadvantages of existing message-passing algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning and signal processing (cs.LG, cs.SP). The paper also includes numerical simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which involves matrix manipulation and optimization (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
