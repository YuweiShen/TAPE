The study uses a large database of spontaneous speech, which involves data processing and analysis (cs.SD). The paper also examines the distribution of word forms at different levels, including acoustic and phonological, which could be related to speech recognition and signal processing (cs.SI). The study uses quantitative metrics to evaluate the discriminability of word forms, which could be related to machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the implication of the findings for language learnability, which could be related to cognitive science and artificial intelligence (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
