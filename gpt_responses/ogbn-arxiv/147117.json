The paper focuses on exploiting the temporal correlation structure in both channel fading and PU occupancy. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. The next likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of networked systems. The paper also deals with system optimization, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper uses numerical examples, which suggests the use of cs.MM (Multimedia) for data analysis and visualization. Finally, the paper uses a greedy policy and a genie-aided system, which suggests the use of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for algorithm design and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
