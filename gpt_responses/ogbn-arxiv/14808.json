This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Zero-shot learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the problem of recognizing objects or classes that have not been seen during training. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses side information such as attributes or word vectors to bridge the relations between the seen and unseen classes. This involves natural language processing techniques, which fall under the domain of computation and language. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image classification, which is a core problem in multimedia analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
