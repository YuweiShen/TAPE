The paper also involves deep learning methods, which are often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, so cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a likely sub-category. The paper proposes a novel algorithm, which involves instance segmentation, so cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories.
