The construction of DNA codes is based on a variant of stochastic local search algorithm, which is a common technique used in data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the design of DNA codes with specific constraints, including Hamming, reverse, reverse-complement, $GC$-content, and a new constraint related to homo-polymers. Information theory is concerned with the efficient encoding and transmission of information, and DNA storage is a form of information storage. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The reliability of DNA storage systems is important for secure data storage. The paper proposes a new constraint for designing DNA codes that can reduce errors during reading and writing data into the synthetic DNA strings. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The construction of DNA codes with specific constraints can be a computationally complex problem. The paper proposes a construction based on a variant of stochastic local search algorithm, which is a common technique used in computational complexity. \n5. cs.DB (Databases): DNA storage is a form of data storage, and the paper discusses the design of DNA codes with specific constraints. Databases are concerned with the efficient storage and retrieval of data, and DNA storage can"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
