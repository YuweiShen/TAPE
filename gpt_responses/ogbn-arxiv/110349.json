The focus on deep learning and interpretable machine learning models suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The discussion of reinforcement learning and decision and control systems suggests a connection to neural networks and evolutionary computation (cs.NE). The mention of symbolic systems and graphical models suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the discussion of convergence between electrical engineering and computer science suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
