This involves the use of Gaussian processes for load predictions and linear approximations for unbalanced three-phase power flow. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and control systems, suggesting that cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses uncertainty and smoothing, which are topics in statistical learning and optimization, indicating that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper applies the method to different test feeders and validates it on a real test feeder, which suggests that cs.NE (Networking and Internet Architecture) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
