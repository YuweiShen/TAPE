The paper also discusses extremalities and curves, which are concepts commonly studied in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The results of the paper may have applications in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI) as well as network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis and optimization techniques, which are also relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
