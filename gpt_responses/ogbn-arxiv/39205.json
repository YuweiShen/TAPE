The paper also employs clustering and decipherment-based approaches, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks in their experiments, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with low-resource languages, which could potentially fall under the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
