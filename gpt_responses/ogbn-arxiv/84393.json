This involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which are typically covered under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves unsupervised learning, which falls under the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. The proposed approach also involves ranking and identifying extrema, which could be considered as optimization or search problems, falling under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves experimental evaluation, which could be considered as a form of empirical study falling under the machine learning (cs.LG) or information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
