This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) since the approach involves using visual-based robot-to-robot detection. The paper also addresses challenges related to data association and estimation, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of on-board sensing and control for formation flight, which is relevant to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
