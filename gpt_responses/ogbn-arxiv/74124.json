The paper proposes a framework that combines probabilistic movement primitives with descriptions of their effects for skill representation, which involves machine learning techniques such as policy search and probabilistic modeling (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also presents an object pushing task for a simulated 3-DOF robot, which involves computer vision and image processing techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of reducing the number of iterations required to learn a new task, which is related to control and optimization problems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
