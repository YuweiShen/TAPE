The focus is on large datasets, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) or natural language processing (cs.NE) applications. The proposed method involves modeling loss and training time as a function of dataset size, which could also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
