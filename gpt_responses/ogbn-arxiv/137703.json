This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions improving system performance, which could indicate that it belongs to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
