Additionally, the paper discusses the theory of flows on graphs, which is a topic in \"Discrete Mathematics\" (cs.DM). The paper also touches on the theory of proof-nets in linear logic, which falls under \"Programming Languages\" (cs.PL). The paper's focus on maps and coloring suggests a connection to \"Graph Theory\" (cs.GT). Finally, the paper's discussion of rewriting and bidirectional typing suggests a connection to \"Computational Logic\" (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
