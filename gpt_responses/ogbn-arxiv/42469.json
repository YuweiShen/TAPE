This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to this sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Cloud computing is a distributed computing paradigm, and the paper discusses the infrastructure and architecture of cloud computing. This sub-category is also likely.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of secure cloud computing systems, which is related to software engineering. This sub-category is also likely.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the exchange of data between different cloud services, which involves data structures and algorithms. This sub-category is less likely but still possible.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Cloud computing relies heavily on networking and internet architecture, and the paper discusses the inter-cloud data exchange, which is related to this sub-category.
