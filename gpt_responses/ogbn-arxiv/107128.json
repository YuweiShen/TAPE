The proposed solution involves modifying the training process to prevent the loss from approaching zero, which can be seen as a form of regularization. This makes the paper relevant to sub-categories such as \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI), \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV), and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves experimentation with different models and optimization techniques, which could also place it in the sub-category of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
