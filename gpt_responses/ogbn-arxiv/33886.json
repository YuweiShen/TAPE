It also involves training the network end-to-end, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the authors apply their method to convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with neural networks and their optimization. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with a fundamental problem in AI, which is reducing the memory footprint of deep neural networks. \n\nFinally, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not focus on developing new algorithms or data structures, but rather on applying existing ones to a specific problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
