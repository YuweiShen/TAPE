This method is based on an optimization model that combines a structural interaction matrix and an elastic net regression model. The paper also develops an efficient algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Given these characteristics, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data mining (cs.DM), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
