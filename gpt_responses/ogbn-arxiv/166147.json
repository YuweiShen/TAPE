This involves combining primitive policies into ensembles, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the evaluation of the method in problems that require both task and motion planning suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
