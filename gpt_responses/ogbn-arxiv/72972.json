The use of GeoDBLP to compile data on researcher migration suggests a focus on social informatics (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.SD). The statistical modeling of migration patterns also suggests a focus on cybernetics (cs.CY) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the implications for education and research worldwide suggest a focus on computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
