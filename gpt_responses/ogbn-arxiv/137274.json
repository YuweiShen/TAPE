The paper introduces a new problem called the $\\ell$-round power dominating set problem and provides hardness results, dynamic programming algorithms, and PTAS for this problem. These techniques are commonly used in the areas of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS), graph theory (cs.GT), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
