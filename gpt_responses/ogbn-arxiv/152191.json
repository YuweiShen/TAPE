It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses the use of Parameter Server (PS) paradigm for ML. Additionally, it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it discusses the theoretical guarantees and empirical behavior of iterative-convergent ML algorithms. It may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category as it discusses the implementation of a new PS system. Finally, it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it discusses the use of ML algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
