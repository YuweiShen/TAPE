The paper also discusses the use of codebooks, which is a common technique in information theory. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the impact of a finite size codebook on performance, which is related to system design and optimization, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category as well. The paper specifically focuses on mmWave communications, which is a subfield of wireless communication, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of beamforming in the context of wireless networks, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
