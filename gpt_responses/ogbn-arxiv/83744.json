This topic falls under the category of computer systems and architecture (cs.DC) as well as computer networks and communications (cs.NE) since SSDs are commonly used in networked systems. The paper also discusses optimization techniques for multi-level cell sensing, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence and robotics (cs.AR). Additionally, the paper discusses error correction algorithms and methods, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
