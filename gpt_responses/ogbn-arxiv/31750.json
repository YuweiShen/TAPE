The paper also discusses type inference and control-flow analysis, which are common topics in programming language research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and evaluation of a static analyzer for JavaScript, which is a common topic in software engineering research. The paper also discusses the configurability of JSAI, which is relevant to software engineering concerns such as modularity and maintainability.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly mentions browser addons as part of the benchmark suite, which suggests a potential focus on security-related concerns such as vulnerability analysis or malware detection.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions control-flow analysis, which is a common topic in systems and control research. The paper also discusses the configurability of JSAI, which could be relevant to systems and control concerns such as adaptability and robustness.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly discuss machine learning, the use of abstract domains and the evaluation of different analysis sensitivities could be seen as related to machine learning techniques such as feature selection and hyperparameter tuning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
