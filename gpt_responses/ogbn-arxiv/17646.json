This involves compressive sensing (CS) technology to efficiently estimate the equivalent MIMO-OFDM mmWave channel. Information theory is closely related to the design of communication systems and channel estimation, making this category the most likely. \n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper deals with the design of hybrid precoders and combiners for MIMO-OFDM systems, which is a key area of research in communication and networking. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper involves the use of signal processing techniques such as compressive sensing and orthogonal matching pursuit to design the hybrid precoders and combiners. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of MIMO-OFDM systems, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as video streaming and high-speed data transfer. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper's focus on the design of hybrid precoders and combiners for MIMO-OFDM systems is closely related to the networking and internet architecture, making this category a likely fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
