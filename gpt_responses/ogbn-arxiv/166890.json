This can be seen as a system-level optimization problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of adaptive modulation and coding, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia transmission. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the use of ARQ can have implications for security and reliability in wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
