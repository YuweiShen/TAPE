The use of compact input encodings and approximation algorithms suggests that information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant. Finally, the focus on efficient algorithms and running times suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
