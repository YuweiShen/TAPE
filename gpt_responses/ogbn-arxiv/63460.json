Additionally, it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it introduces a new soft attention mechanism and a scale-aware loss function to regularize the training of different branches. It may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image and video data. Finally, it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it proposes a new technique to estimate the size of each head automatically."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
