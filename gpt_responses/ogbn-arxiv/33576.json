It also has applications in detecting concurrency-related vulnerabilities (cs.CR) and optimizing parallelization (cs.LO). The paper describes an algorithmic technique for generating commutativity conditions, which involves exploring the state space of the data structure (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a prototype tool for implementing the technique (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
