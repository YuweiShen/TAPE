The paper also involves the study of various families of divergences, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or mathematical statistics (cs.MS). Finally, the paper discusses the accuracy of the inequalities for both small and large variations, which could be relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
