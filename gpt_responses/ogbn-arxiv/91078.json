The paper also makes use of convex optimization techniques, which are commonly used in the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper provides experimental results in the field of computer vision (cs.CV), and makes use of simulations and numerical analysis (cs.DS, cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
