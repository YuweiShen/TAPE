The focus on the drifting setting suggests that the paper may also be relevant to research on concept drift and online learning in data streams, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
