Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a novel approach for age estimation using convolutional neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of multimedia data (gait videos) and the analysis of human behavior, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper proposes a new loss function for regression, which could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
