The focus is on preprocessing textual data for deep learning models in a cloud-based environment. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DL (Deep Learning). However, given the emphasis on natural language processing and text summarization, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.IR and cs.LG. The use of deep learning techniques also makes cs.AI and cs.DL possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
