This involves the study of outage probability and achievable rates, as well as the effect of various parameters such as power amplifiers efficiency and number of antennas. These topics are typically covered in the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Communications (cs.COMM), Optimization and Control (cs.OH), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
