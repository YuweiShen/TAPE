Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions algorithms from MIMO communications, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia), and discusses the combination of two different approaches, which could be considered as a sub-topic of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
