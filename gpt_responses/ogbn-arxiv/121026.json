The proposed solution involves the use of bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN), which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the comparison of the proposed solution with a state-of-the-art IM/DD solution, which is a topic related to communication (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based system, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
