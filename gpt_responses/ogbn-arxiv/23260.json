The proposed method also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, which are key concerns in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a dedicated detection network and cluster-based scale estimation also involves robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the experiments involve the use of visual data, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
