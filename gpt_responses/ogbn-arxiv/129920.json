The use of bibliometric analysis and comparisons with different generations of researchers suggests a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL). The paper also discusses institutional conditions and incentives, which could fall under the categories of cybernetics (cs.CY) and systems and control (cs.SD). Finally, the paper may touch on the topic of computational complexity (cs.CC) in terms of analyzing and comparing large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
