The proposed approach involves metric learning to jointly learn a rich embedding and 3D pose regression from multi-view synchronized videos of human motions and very limited 3D pose annotations. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of metric learning and adversarial loss for improving performance indicates that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of multi-view videos suggests that the paper may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Lastly, the establishment of view-invariant pose retrieval benchmarks on publicly available datasets suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
