This falls under the scope of computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also introduces a new prior for image recovery, which involves constructing a nonlocal sparsification system, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT). The method also involves developing an effective algorithm, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
