The paper extensively experiments on synthetic and real benchmark datasets and observes state-of-the-art performance compared to existing robust photometric stereo methods. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of dictionary learning also suggests a potential fit for cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves some graphics-related work, which could place it in cs.GR (Computer Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
