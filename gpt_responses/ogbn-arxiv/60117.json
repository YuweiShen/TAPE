The paper also discusses the use of a hybrid precoding scheme, which is a technique used in wireless communication networks (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel generalized spatial modulation (GenSM) technique, which is a spatial modulation technique used in wireless communication systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the hybrid precoder design, which is a system-level optimization problem in communication systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
