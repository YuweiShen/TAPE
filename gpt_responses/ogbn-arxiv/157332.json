The paper discusses the challenges of completing payments on PCNs and proposes a solution that uses a multi-path transport protocol to achieve balanced utilization of channels and fairness across flows. The paper also presents extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other possible sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
