Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper proposes low complexity implementations, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed detectors, which could be considered under cs.SI (Signal Processing). Finally, the paper deals with communication systems, which could be categorized under cs.COM (Computer Communications and Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
