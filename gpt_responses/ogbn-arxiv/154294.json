This is a core topic in game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper considers various combinatorial optimization problems such as vertex and set cover, facility location, and network design problems. These are classic topics in algorithms and data structures. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the computation of near-optimal and near-stable approximate strong equilibria, which is a topic of interest in AI. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the computational complexity of finding strong equilibria in cost sharing games, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While not a primary focus of the paper, the use of linear programming formulations to derive results for strong equilibria may be of interest to researchers in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
