The paper discusses techniques to aggregate state distances and their associated properties, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also investigates efficient planning graph data structures that incorporate BDDs, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper presents two planners and compares their performance with state-of-the-art approaches in conditional planning, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
