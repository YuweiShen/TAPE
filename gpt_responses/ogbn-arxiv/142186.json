The paper also presents a general framework to analyze alternating minimization algorithms for scaling problems, which makes extensive use of concepts from invariant theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
