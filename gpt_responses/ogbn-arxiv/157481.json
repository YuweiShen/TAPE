This work is likely to be relevant to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed approach involves the use of Tucker decomposition and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), which are commonly used in machine learning and time series analysis. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques such as tensorization and ARIMA suggests that this paper may be relevant to the AI sub-category. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): Time series analysis is a common topic in statistics, and the proposed approach involves forecasting multiple time series. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The use of tensorization and Tucker decomposition suggests that this paper may be relevant to the DS sub-category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The use of tensorization and decomposition techniques may also be relevant to the IT sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
