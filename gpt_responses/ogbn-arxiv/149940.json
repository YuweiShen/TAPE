This involves the use of images that are invisible to human subjects but can be recovered from photos taken by a camera. The paper also discusses the feasibility of this type of attack and evaluates the channel's stealth. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other likely sub-categories include cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
