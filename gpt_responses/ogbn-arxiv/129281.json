It then defines a new subgraph called the $(c\\alpha, \\alpha)$-stable Delaunay graph ($\\mathrm{SDG}$) and presents a kinetic data structure for maintaining it as the points move. This work involves computational geometry (cs.CG) as it deals with geometric structures and algorithms. The use of a kinetic data structure also suggests a connection to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the properties of the $\\mathrm{SDG}$ and its relationship with the Delaunay triangulation, which falls under the sub-category of graph theory (cs.GR). The use of algebraic trajectories and the analysis of events during motion suggest a connection to the sub-category of control theory (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
