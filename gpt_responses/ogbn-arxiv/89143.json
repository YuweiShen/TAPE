The paper addresses the challenges of multi-application concurrency within the GPU memory system, which is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper discusses the performance concerns of multi-application concurrency within the GPU memory system, and proposes a new memory hierarchy design to improve performance. This is a key aspect of the cs.PF sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): While the paper does not directly focus on programming languages, it discusses the challenges of multi-application concurrency within the GPU memory system, which is relevant to programming languages that target GPUs.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new memory hierarchy design to improve multi-application concurrency support within the GPU memory system, which is a key aspect of system design and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
