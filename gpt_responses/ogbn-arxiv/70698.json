The paper also discusses the application of these codes to file synchronization, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper involves the design and analysis of algorithms for encoding and decoding the codes, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of the codes, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
