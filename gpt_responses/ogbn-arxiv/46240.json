The proposed processing blocks are designed to blend neighborhood information and share information across low- and high-resolution processing branches, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed architectures on multiple point segmentation benchmarks, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) to some extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
