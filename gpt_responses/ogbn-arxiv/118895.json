It may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as Chinese characters are a form of written language. The use of machine learning techniques and deep neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on improving recognition accuracy through loss functions suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
