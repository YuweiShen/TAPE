The paper proposes a joint pushing and caching policy to maximize bandwidth utilization, which involves the use of storage resources at end users and predictability of user demand processes. This problem is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including network infrastructure (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), distributed computing (cs.DC), and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
