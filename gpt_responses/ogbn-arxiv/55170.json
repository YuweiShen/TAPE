It focuses on attackers who perform integrity attacks on a set of sensors and actuators in a control system. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes the use of stochastic, time-varying parameters in the control system to limit an attacker's model knowledge and inhibit their ability to construct stealthy attack sequences. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper proposes the use of sensor nonlinearities to enhance the effectiveness of the moving target defense, which could fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses mechanisms for analysis and design, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category. \n\nLastly, the paper analyzes attack detectability, which could indicate that it belongs to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
