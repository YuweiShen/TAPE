It involves natural language processing and statistical modeling techniques to align tweets with the corresponding segments of the event. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) and data mining techniques to analyze the data, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. The paper also involves statistical modeling and machine learning techniques, which makes cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SD (Software Engineering) possible categories.
