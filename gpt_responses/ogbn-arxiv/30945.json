The paper also uses principal component analysis (PCA) for visualizing and interpreting the tactile data, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE). Therefore, these categories are likely to be relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
