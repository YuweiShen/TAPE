The method involves enforcing spatial contextual constraints on class labels, which could also be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses SVM classifiers and linear regression models, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
