It also involves decision making and optimization in uncertain environments, which falls under the category of decision making (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the sample complexity of the algorithms, which is a topic in statistical learning theory (cs.MA). Finally, the paper deals with strategic exploration, which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
