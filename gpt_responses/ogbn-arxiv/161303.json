It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it involves optimizing neural network architectures using an evolutionary algorithm. Additionally, it could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves developing more efficient neural network models. The paper also involves optimizing calculations, which could place it under the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category.
