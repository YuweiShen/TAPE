The focus on memory optimization suggests that cs.AI and cs.EM are the most likely categories, followed by cs.LG and cs.CV, which are relevant to the neural network architecture and deployment. The mention of control systems in the abstract suggests that cs.SY is also a possible category, although it may be less likely than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
