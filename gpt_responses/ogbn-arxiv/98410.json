This work is highly relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) communities, as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) fields. Additionally, the proposed approach involves using adaptive feature abstraction, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
