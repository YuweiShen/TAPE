The method involves integrating spatial features and training a conditional random field (CRF), which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also performs experiments on standard datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
