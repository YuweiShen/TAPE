This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a strategy of moving target defense (MTD) to generate multiple new deep models, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on an embedded computing board, which suggests that it may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
