This involves selective enhancement of the cysts by inducing motion to a given OCT slice. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on public datasets and a private dataset. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of a CNN also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the evaluation of the proposed method on multiple datasets could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of OCT volumes and the focus on medical imaging could also suggest cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
