This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper mentions virtual-reality headsets, which suggests a possible application in the field of computer graphics.\n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses a method for capturing full-body motion in crowded scenes, which has implications for human-computer interaction and user experience design.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on motion capture and pose estimation could also be relevant to robotics, particularly in the development of robots that can mimic human movements.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper's use of fisheye cameras and its potential application in virtual reality could also fall under the category of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
