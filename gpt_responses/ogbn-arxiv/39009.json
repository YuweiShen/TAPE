The approach involves solving inverse configuration space problems and generating a finite Boolean algebra to enumerate the entire search space for planning. This involves a combination of robotics (cs.RO), mechanical engineering (cs.ME), computer engineering (cs.CE), machine learning (cs.LG), and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
