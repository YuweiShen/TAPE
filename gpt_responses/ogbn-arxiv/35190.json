This approach draws connections to estimation of Radon-Nikodym derivatives in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The paper demonstrates the versatility and performance of the proposed model on both synthetic and real-world data. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
