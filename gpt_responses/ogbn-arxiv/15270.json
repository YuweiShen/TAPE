The paper uses techniques from information theory, statistical learning theory, and computational complexity theory to derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of single-parameter revenue maximization. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), which is the intersection of computer science and economics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.EC (Economics and Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
