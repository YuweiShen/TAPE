The paper also discusses the use of network coding maps, which is a topic that falls under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of optimization techniques to reduce interference, which is a topic that falls under the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category.
