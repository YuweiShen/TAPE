The paper also proposes a new method for filter level pruning, which involves optimization and statistical analysis, indicating a potential fit for artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on image classification tasks, suggesting a possible fit for multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
