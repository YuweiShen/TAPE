The paper also discusses interference alignment techniques, which are commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication systems (cs.COM). Finally, the paper focuses on the two-cell scenario, which is a specific case of multi-cell MIMO systems, and thus could be relevant to the subfield of multi-user MIMO (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
