The paper also discusses probabilistic shaping, which is a technique used in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI). The use of random coding arguments and evaluation of input distributions suggests a connection to probability theory and statistics (cs.DS). Finally, the discussion of the relation to the LM rate and the generalized mutual information (GMI) suggests a connection to machine learning and information theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
