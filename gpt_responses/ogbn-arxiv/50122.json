This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the transmission and processing of information. The paper also involves signal processing (cs.DC) as it analyzes the impact of CFO and SFO on the received signal. The use of MIMO-OFDM schemes also involves networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it deals with the transmission of data over a network. The paper also involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the transmission of digital TV signals. Finally, the paper involves signal processing and communications (cs.SI) as it deals with the impact of CFO and SFO on the performance of MIMO-OFDM schemes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
