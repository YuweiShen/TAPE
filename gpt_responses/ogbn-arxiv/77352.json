The paper proposes a new algorithm that produces a compact representation of point-sets with provable guarantees on its performance. This problem is related to several sub-fields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
