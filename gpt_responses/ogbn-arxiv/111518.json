The use of wireless communication techniques for vehicular communication suggests that it could also belong to the network and internet architecture (cs.NI) category. The paper proposes a novel protocol for inter-vehicle session key establishment, which involves the use of blockchain technology, indicating that it could also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) category. The paper also discusses the use of side-channel communication techniques, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper presents techniques for constraining the throughput requirement and validating the location of the intended recipient vehicle, which could belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
