The paper also mentions the use of a force/tactile sensor, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI) techniques. The integration of reactive grasping control and motion planning also involves control theory (cs.SY) and potentially reinforcement learning (cs.LG) for optimizing the control policies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
