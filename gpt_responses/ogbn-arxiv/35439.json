The paper proposes new algorithms and potential functions for this problem, which are relevant to several subfields of computer science. Specifically, the paper uses techniques from data structures (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational geometry (cs.CG), information theory (cs.IT), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
