The paper also discusses the use of ultra-wideband (UWB) radios, which are commonly used in wireless communication and networking (cs.CR). The paper proposes methods for combining data from multiple sensors, which involves machine learning and data analysis techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed methods in tracking people through walls, which is a topic related to computer vision and image processing (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
