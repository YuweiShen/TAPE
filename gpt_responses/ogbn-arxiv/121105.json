Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses Wikipedia articles to pair with satellite images, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper proposes strategies to learn representations of satellite images by predicting properties of corresponding articles, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions pre-training strategies, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with georeferenced data, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
