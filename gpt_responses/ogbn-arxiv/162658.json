The paper also introduces improvements to the backbone network, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method involves object detection, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper presents results on a benchmark dataset, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
