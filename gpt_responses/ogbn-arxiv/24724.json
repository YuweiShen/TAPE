The paper also discusses communication complexity models, which fall under computational complexity (cs.CC). Information theory (cs.IT) is relevant because the paper deals with sublinear space usage. Cryptography and security (cs.CR) are relevant because the paper discusses the interaction between a weak verifier and an untrusted prover. Finally, the paper deals with problems on graphs, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
