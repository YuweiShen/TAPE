The paper also discusses the impact of label granularity on CNN accuracy, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also propose a new metric to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-grain labeling, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
