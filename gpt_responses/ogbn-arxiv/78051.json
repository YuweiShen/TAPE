The paper specifically evaluates different methods for calibrating uncertainty estimation using different measures of uncertainty, such as entropy and mutual information, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural network (cs.NE) research. The paper also proposes a novel method for neural network parameter estimation, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
