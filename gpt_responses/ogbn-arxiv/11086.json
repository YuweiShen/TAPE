This task is relevant to several applications such as videoconferencing, films, games, and generation of training data for gaze estimation. The paper proposes a novel method that leverages generative adversarial training to synthesize an eye image conditioned on a target gaze direction. The method ensures perceptual similarity and consistency of synthesized images to the real images. The paper also incorporates perceptual and cycle consistency losses into the architecture to attain high-quality images. Given the focus on image synthesis and manipulation, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision). Other likely sub-categories include cs.GR (Graphics), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
