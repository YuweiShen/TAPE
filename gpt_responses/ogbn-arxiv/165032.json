The use of fourth-order cumulants to extract more information from the received signal is also a topic of interest in information theory. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the problem of DOA estimation is relevant in many network applications, such as wireless sensor networks and radar systems. \n- cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper is primarily focused on signal processing techniques for DOA estimation, making this category a likely fit. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of coprime arrays and fourth-order cumulants may have applications in multimedia signal processing, such as audio and image processing. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a spatial smoothing scheme applied to the fourth-order cumulant matrix, which involves numerical computations and optimization. Therefore, this category is also a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
