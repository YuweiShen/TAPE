This involves designing a function of the variables, optimising the function parameters using a genetic algorithm, and calculating the difference between statistics computed on the data set and a randomised version of the data set. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), neural networks (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
