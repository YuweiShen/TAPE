The use of deep fusion models and machine learning techniques also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the evaluation of the algorithms on image datasets and real-world videos suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
