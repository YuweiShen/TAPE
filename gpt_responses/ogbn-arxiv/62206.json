This involves computer vision-based gait analysis, Residual Convolutional Neural Network, Region Proposal Network, and Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves many-to-many imaging methodology, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of deep learning models for prediction falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves the use of RF signals for imaging, which falls under cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
