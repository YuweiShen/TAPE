It specifically focuses on sequential effect systems, which reason about behavior over time, and captures properties such as atomicity, unstructured lock ownership, or even general safety properties. This makes it likely to also fall under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses control flow constructs, which are a topic in formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
