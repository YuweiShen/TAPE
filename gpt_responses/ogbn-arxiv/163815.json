Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely category, as it deals with the mathematical foundations of signal processing. The paper also involves architecture design, which falls under cs.AR (Architecture), and hardware implementation, which falls under cs.ET (Embedded Systems). The paper also discusses the critical path, which is a concept in computer science and falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the suitability of the proposed solution for practical applications, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
