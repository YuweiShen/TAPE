The paper proposes a Bayesian perspective and a variational metric scaling framework for learning a proper metric scaling parameter. The paper also conducts experiments on mini-ImageNet, which is a popular dataset in computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
