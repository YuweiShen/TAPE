The algorithm involves channel probing and hypothesis testing, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.MM). The proposed approach can also be applied to system control and automation (cs.SY) in the context of secure wireless communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
