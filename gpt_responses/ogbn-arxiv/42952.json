Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of data communication and storage. The paper also involves wireless communication and networking, which suggests the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as likely choices. The use of phased antenna arrays and mmWave technology also suggests the categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as possible choices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
