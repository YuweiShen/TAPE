The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which are often found in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of cost-customized external knowledge graphs suggests that the paper may also fall under the cs.LG (Learning) sub-category. The paper's focus on extracting relevant sub-graphs from a knowledge graph suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of knowledge graphs and their relationships between entities suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
