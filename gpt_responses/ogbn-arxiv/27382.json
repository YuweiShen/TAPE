Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new dataset and uses a CNN model for face recognition, which falls under the categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the reasoning behind using multiple modalities for better accuracy, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with biometric security, which falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
