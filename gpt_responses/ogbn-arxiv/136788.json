Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithmic framework for deep-architecture-based operator splitting for nonconvex optimization, which is a common topic in machine learning and computer vision research. Therefore, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.NA, cs.DS, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
