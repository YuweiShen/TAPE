The paper also focuses on using expressive languages like higher-order logic, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of probabilities and Bayesian reasoning is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper also touches on the topic of cryptography (cs.CR) in discussing the need for globally consistent and empirically satisfactory unification of probability and logic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
