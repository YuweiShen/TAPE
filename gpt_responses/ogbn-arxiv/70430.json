The proposed algorithm is tested with several databases, indicating that it may be applicable to computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS) problems. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of alternative measures to evaluate classifier performance, which is a topic that may be related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
