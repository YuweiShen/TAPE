The paper also presents a new precoding technique to mitigate multi-user interference and quantization distortions, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The use of linear programming for optimization is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with massive MIMO systems, which is a topic of interest in the field of multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
