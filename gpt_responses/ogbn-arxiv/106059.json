The paper also discusses the challenges of obtaining a representative sample of images from a large, general-purpose, dynamic image collection, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR). The experiments involve varying the amount of classes used for creating the dictionary and computing different BoVW descriptors, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of semantics on dictionary quality, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
