The paper also proposes separated source-channel schemes and joint source-channel schemes, which are related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses a code design based on scalar quantization and uncoded QAM modulation, which is related to communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
