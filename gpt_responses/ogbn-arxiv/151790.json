The paper also proposes a novel analytic model of a basic unit in a layered hierarchical model with explicit compositional structure and a well-defined discriminative cost function, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments on two datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the ability to visualize parts and faster inference due to separability of the units, which suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
