The paper also presents a method for selective belief filtering in a simulated multi-robot warehouse, which falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO). The use of passivity to perform selective updates over the belief factors is a machine learning technique, which is relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed method, which involves the use of probability distributions, making it relevant to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Bayesian Networks, which is a common topic in the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
