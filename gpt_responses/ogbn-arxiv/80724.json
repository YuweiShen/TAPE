It also involves training a neural network to handle noisy labels, which is a common task in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the experiments involve image classification tasks. Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the proposed method involves training a neural network and optimizing loss functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
