This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a downlink multi-user system where the transmission from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to various users is achieved by the RIS reflecting the incident signals of the BS towards the users. This involves networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hybrid beamforming scheme and an iterative algorithm to solve the sum-rate maximization problem. This involves systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with enhancing wireless transmissions, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and low latency.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This is the least likely category, but the paper does involve some technical language related to beamforming and wireless communications, which could fall under the domain of computation and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
