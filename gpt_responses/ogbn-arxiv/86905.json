This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper uses stochastic geometry to model the randomly deployed users and interferers, which is a common technique in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed framework involves signal alignment, which is a technique used in control systems to align signals for better performance.\n4. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a new framework for downlink and uplink transmission in NOMA systems, which is a topic of interest in communication and networking.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not directly related to multimedia, the paper does involve the use of MIMO techniques, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as video streaming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
