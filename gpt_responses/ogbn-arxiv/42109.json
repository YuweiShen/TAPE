The paper also discusses the use of adversarial approaches, which is a common technique in the field of artificial intelligence, suggesting that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category.
