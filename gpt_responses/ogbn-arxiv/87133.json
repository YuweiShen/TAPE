The paper uses multiple CNN detectors and feature embeddings to solve the problem, which are common techniques in computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with images of clothes, which can be considered as a type of multimedia. The paper proposes a system to search for apparel products from images in the wild, which is a multimedia retrieval problem. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with searching for apparel products in online catalogs, which is an information retrieval problem. The paper proposes a system to automatically find the closest visually similar clothes in the online catalog, which involves indexing and ranking of items in the catalog. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques such as CNN detectors and feature embeddings to solve the problem of searching for apparel products from images in the wild. The paper also uses a multi-task function to learn the feature embeddings, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with natural language descriptions of apparel products, which can be considered as a type of language. The paper proposes a system to classify high-level descriptive regions such as t-shirts, tunic or dresses, which involves natural"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
