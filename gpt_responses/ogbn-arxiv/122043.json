The paper also discusses the complexity of evaluating queries in this language, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of linear algebra in the language suggests that it may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
