The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) also suggests that it could be classified under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The mention of datasets such as AFLW, AFW, COFW, and IBUG indicates that it could also be classified under Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the use of hard sample mining suggests that it could also be classified under Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
