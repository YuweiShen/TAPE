The paper focuses on the development of flexible autonomous agents that self-supervise in complex novel physical environments. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the agent's ability to move and interact with objects, which suggests that it could belong to cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper mentions object dynamics prediction, detection, localization, and recognition tasks, which are related to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's focus on creating flexible autonomous agents that self-supervise in complex novel physical environments suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
