These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including numerical analysis (cs.NA), computational engineering (cs.CE), and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions distributed meshes and $hp$-adaptivity, which are relevant to the sub-category of modeling and simulation (cs.MS). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges and lessons learned in running a large community software project, which is relevant to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
