The paper provides strong positive results for both the asymmetric and symmetric versions of the problem under a natural input stability condition called $\\alpha$-perturbation resilience. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
