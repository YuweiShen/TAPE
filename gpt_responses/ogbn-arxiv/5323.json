The paper also uses techniques from the study of limitations of LP/SDP hierarchies for Max-CSPs (cs.DS), and the construction of special distributions and subgroups (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper discusses the construction of balanced pairwise independent distributions, which is a topic in combinatorics (cs.DM) and the stretching and collapsing technique used in the proofs may be related to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
