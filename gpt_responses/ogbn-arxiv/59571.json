The proposed system involves processing agents using computationally intensive models for recognition, tracking, motion estimation, and prediction, which are all related to computer vision (cs.CV). The system also involves ranking agents based on their impact on decision making, which is a task that can be accomplished using machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the system is designed to be used in real-time on autonomous vehicles, which involves control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
