The use of games and strategies in the intensional model suggests a connection to game semantics (cs.TL) and proof theory (cs.LF). Finally, the mention of an effective version and a Universality Theorem suggests a connection to computability theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
