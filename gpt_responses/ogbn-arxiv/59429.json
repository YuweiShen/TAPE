The paper proposes a deep joint super resolution (DJSR) model that uses both external and self similarities for SR, which involves training a Stacked Denoising Convolutional Auto Encoder (SDCAE) on external examples and fine-tuning it with multi-scale self examples. This suggests that the paper may also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the DJSR model perceptually, which suggests that it may also belong to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses sub-model training and selection to enhance the model performance, which suggests that it may also belong to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
