The proposed framework is based on a deep neural network, which requires large-scale synthetic data for training, indicating a potential application of machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) in this work. Finally, the paper presents a new benchmark dataset for stereo reconstruction, which could be relevant to graphics (GR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
