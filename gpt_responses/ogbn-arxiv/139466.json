This topic is closely related to formal languages and automata theory, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.FL and cs.TC. The paper also discusses the programming language PCF, which falls under the sub-category cs.PL. Additionally, the paper involves mathematical logic and proof theory, which are covered by the sub-category cs.LO.
