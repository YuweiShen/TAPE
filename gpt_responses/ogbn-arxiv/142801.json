The paper also discusses the use of vector word embeddings, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for storing word embeddings that is highly efficient, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural layers, which could also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
