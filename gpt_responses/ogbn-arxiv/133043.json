This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of exemplar-based cross-alignment, which involves learning a mechanism of alignment, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories.
