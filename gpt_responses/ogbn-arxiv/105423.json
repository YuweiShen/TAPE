The paper also discusses the mutual information rate between transmitted and received sequences, which is a common concept in information theory and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of input distributions, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper applies the general ideas to specific classes of channels, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of easy-to-compute bounds, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
