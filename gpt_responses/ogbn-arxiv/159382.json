This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic methods and optimization frameworks, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses uncertainty propagation and bias correction, which are relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
