The paper also discusses the potential security and privacy concerns related to these emerging paradigms, which are studied in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a conceptual model for cloud futurology, which involves software engineering and system design, studied in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category.
