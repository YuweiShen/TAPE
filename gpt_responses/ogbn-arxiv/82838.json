The paper proposes a novel compression technique using Kronecker products, which is a mathematical operation commonly used in linear algebra. This technique is applied to various types of RNNs, including LSTM, GRU, and FastRNN, and achieves significant compression factors of 15-38x with minor loss in accuracy. The paper also discusses a hybrid decomposition technique to control the compression factors achieved by Kronecker products. Overall, the paper's focus on RNN compression for IoT devices and the use of mathematical operations suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
