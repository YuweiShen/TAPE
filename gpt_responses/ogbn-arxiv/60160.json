It also uses the cognitive hierarchy framework to identify good strategies, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithmic questions related to the k-approval voting rule suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG).
