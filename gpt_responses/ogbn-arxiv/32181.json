The use of diachronic corpora and the analysis of patterns and linguistic clues suggest a focus on machine learning and data mining (cs.DL). The exploration of latent semantic space and topic membership analysis are also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of the proposed measure to a political science case study suggests a potential connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
