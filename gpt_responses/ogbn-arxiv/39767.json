Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also extensively uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for experiments, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with neural networks, which is a popular topic in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of text noise, which can be related to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) that deals with image noise."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
