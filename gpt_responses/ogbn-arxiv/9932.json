Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the performance of DQN in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), which involves visual perception and control, indicating a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
