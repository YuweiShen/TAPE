Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses complexity bounds and algorithms for solving the containment problem for OMQs, which involves techniques from logic and computational complexity, suggesting cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as possible categories. Finally, the paper mentions two emerging applications of OMQ containment, namely distribution over components and UCQ rewritability of OMQs, which may relate to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
