It may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as optical flow estimation is a common task in video processing. The paper also incorporates principles of bilateral filters, which are commonly used in image processing and may suggest a connection to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with image processing and motion estimation, which are important in computer graphics. Finally, the paper may also belong to the neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE) sub-category as it proposes a novel method for optical flow estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
