The paper proposes a training routine that maximizes the entropy of the output probability distribution for training convolutional neural networks, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the theoretical and empirical justification of their approach, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of training with noisy labels, which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper provides state-of-the-art performance across a variety of classification tasks, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
