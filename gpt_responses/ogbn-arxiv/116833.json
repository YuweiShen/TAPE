It extends the prior work on monitors-as-memories approach to cover multiparty protocols, asynchronous communication, decoupled rollbacks, and process passing. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Software Engineering (cs.SE), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
