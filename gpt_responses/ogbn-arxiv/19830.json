The paper discusses the challenges of exploiting edge video caching in current client-driven video streaming solutions and proposes a network-assisted approach to mitigate these challenges. \n\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper focuses on adaptive video streaming, which is a key component of multimedia systems. The proposed approach aims to improve the video quality and reduce stalling, which are important metrics for user satisfaction in multimedia systems. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a network-side solution for exploiting edge video caching, which involves distributed caching and coordination between the clients and the network. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper formulates the quality assignment problem as an optimization problem and develops several heuristics with polynomial complexity. This involves designing a control logic to optimize the video quality and cache hits. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - While security is not a primary focus of the paper, the proposed approach involves network-side control logic, which could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. The paper briefly discusses the security implications of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
