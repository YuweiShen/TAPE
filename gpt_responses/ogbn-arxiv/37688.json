Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also uses anti-concentration results on random matrices, which suggests a connection to machine learning and statistics, and thus cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.ST (Statistics) are also likely sub-categories. The paper proposes optimal adaptive policies, which involves optimization algorithms, and thus cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the identification of system parameters, which is related to robotics and autonomous systems, and thus cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
