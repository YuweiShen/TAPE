The paper also discusses the importance of multi-objective joint semantic support, which is a common topic in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper explores the influence of network structure and scale on scene understanding, which is relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of remote sensing scenes, which is related to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
