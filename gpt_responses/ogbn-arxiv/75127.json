This measure captures various types of correlation detected in previous measures of rank correlation like the Spearman correlation and the Kendall tau correlation. The paper also shows that the maximal rank correlation satisfies the data processing and tensorization properties, which are important in information theory. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the relationship between maximal rank correlation and the FKG inequality, which is a well-known result in probability theory. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). \n\nFinally, the paper poses the problem of the complexity of the computation of this new measure and gives a simple but exponential-time algorithm for it. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
