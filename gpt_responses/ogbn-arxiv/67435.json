Information theory is the study of communication systems and their limits, and polar codes are a recent development in this field. Therefore, cs.IT is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a new method for keeping the generator matrix of polar codes secret, which is a crucial aspect of the proposed cryptosystem. The paper also discusses the security and reliability of the proposed scheme. Therefore, cs.CR is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed scheme and how it compares to previous cryptosystems. Therefore, cs.CC is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly deal with social or information networks, but the proposed scheme could be used in such networks for secure communication. Therefore, cs.SI is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal with social issues related to computers, but it does discuss the security and privacy implications of the proposed scheme. Therefore, cs.CY is a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
