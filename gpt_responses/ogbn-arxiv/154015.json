The paper also discusses the use of trigonometric polynomials in function approximation, which is a topic in the sub-category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of maximum loss functional and gives estimates on generalization error, which are topics in the sub-category of \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT).
