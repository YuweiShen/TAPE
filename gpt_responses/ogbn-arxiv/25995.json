This falls under the category of cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also involves the use of data structures (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.GR) to solve the problem. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of the algorithm in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
