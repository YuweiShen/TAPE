The paper also discusses the tradeoff between rate, delay, and probability of error, which is a common theme in coding theory (cs.CC). The notion of side-information is also a key aspect of machine learning and data science (cs.SI), and the paper's focus on the impact of side-information on coding performance could be of interest to researchers in this field. Additionally, the paper uses a sequential setting to model the real-time reconstruction of source symbols, which could be relevant to researchers in the distributed systems (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper's discussion of the impact of ignorance on coding performance could be of interest to researchers in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category, who often deal with issues of uncertainty and incomplete information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
