The use of lattices is a common technique in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the implementation of Gaussian shaping, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper uses the flatness factor to analyze the error probability, which is a technique in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper introduces the notion of good constellations, which is a topic in networking (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
