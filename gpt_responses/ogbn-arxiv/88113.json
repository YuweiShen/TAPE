The paper also introduces a new relaxation of differential privacy that involves hypothesis testing and provides an algebraic framework for composition, which are topics that are relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of subsampling and provides a technique for importing results from original differential privacy to the new relaxation, which are topics that are relevant to data science (cs.DS) and statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
