The focus on community structures and block models suggests that the paper could belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.SD (Software Engineering). The use of directed networks and the proposal of a new core-periphery structure formulation could also fit under cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the methods proposed for detecting the directed core-periphery structure involve computational complexity and accuracy, which could relate to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
