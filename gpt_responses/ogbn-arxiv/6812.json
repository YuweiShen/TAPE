The paper proposes a new approach to improve the regret guarantees of nonstochastic multi-armed bandits when the effective range of the losses in each round is small. This problem is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
