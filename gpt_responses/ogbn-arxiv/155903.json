It also involves the use of a Lagrange multiplier, which is a concept from information theory (cs.IT). The paper discusses the learnability of the method, which is a topic in both machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and the experiments involve image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between learnability and model capacity, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
