It employs secure hash algorithm and secure socket shell to achieve reliability components of the proposed scheme. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions storing patient records in the cloud using the Keil board that is connected to the infusion pump. This could potentially involve information retrieval techniques. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed system is based on the Internet of Things technology and employs IoT-cloud to monitor the diabetic patients. The Kiel board is embedded with Ethernet port and Cortex-M3 micro-controller that controls the insulin infusion pump. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper mentions implementing an easy way to control and monitor the diabetic insulin pump. This could involve software engineering techniques. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a hardware implementation of a diabetic health care system using Alaris 8100 infusion pump and Keil LPC-1768 board. This could involve systems and control techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
