The paper also discusses control theory and economics, which are relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper introduces a new type of value function called the particle value function, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of mathematical optimization and algorithms (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
