It also involves the use of large-scale real scene text datasets, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed framework utilizes word annotations, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of weakly supervised learning is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and the paper also mentions the use of deep learning models (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
