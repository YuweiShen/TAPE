Additionally, since the paper focuses on compressing neural networks for mobile devices, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also involves knowledge transfer from a teacher network, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Furthermore, since the paper deals with computational and memory bottlenecks, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
