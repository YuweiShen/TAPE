This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The method proposed in the paper involves projecting features and eliminating redundant features, which involves some dimensionality reduction techniques that are commonly used in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
