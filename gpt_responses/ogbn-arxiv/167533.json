The paper also uses semidefinite programming relaxation for CSP, which is a common technique in optimization and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the algebraic approach to CSP, which involves the study of algebraic structures and falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper deals with the study of constraint languages and their properties, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
