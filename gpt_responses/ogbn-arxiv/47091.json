The paper evaluates the approach on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The paper also analyzes the learned features and weights and demonstrates the robustness of the approach against adversarial examples. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
