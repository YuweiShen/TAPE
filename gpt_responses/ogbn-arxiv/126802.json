The paper also proposes a framework that provides transaction primitives to ensure secure execution of smart contracts. \n\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the execution of smart contracts in a distributed environment, which is a topic closely related to distributed computing. The paper also proposes a framework that provides transaction primitives to ensure correct execution of smart contracts in a distributed environment. \n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a framework that provides transaction primitives to ensure correct execution of smart contracts. This involves the use of data structures and algorithms to manage concurrent execution of smart contract functions. \n\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework that provides transaction primitives to simplify the development of smart contracts. This is a topic closely related to software engineering, as it involves the design and implementation of software systems. \n\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a framework that provides transaction primitives to simplify the development of smart contracts. This involves the use of programming languages to define the behavior of smart contracts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
