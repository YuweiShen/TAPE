This is a core area of research in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol for multi-stream cooperative communications, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the performance results and tradeoffs of the proposed scheme, which involves the coordination and control of multiple relay nodes in a wireless network. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of multiple data streams over a wireless network, which is a key aspect of multimedia communication. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but these aspects may be relevant in the context of wireless network security and privacy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
