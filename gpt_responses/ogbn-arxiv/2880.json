This is a key area of research in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper studies a cognitive radio downlink network with multiple users, which is a networking problem. It also deals with power splitting and beamforming, which are important aspects of wireless networking.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper investigates robust secure artificial noise-aided beamforming, which is a security problem. It also considers imperfect channel state information, which is a common challenge in secure communication.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a one-dimensional search algorithm based on ${\\cal S}\\text{-Procedure} $ to solve the max-min fairness problem. This is a control problem, and the algorithm is a control technique.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but it does consider a tradeoff between the secrecy rate of the secondary user receiver and the energy harvested by the energy harvesting receivers. This can be seen as a tradeoff between different objectives, which is a common problem in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
