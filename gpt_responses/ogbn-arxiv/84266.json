The paper proposes a new approach to text generation using a hidden semi-markov model (HSMM) decoder, which is a type of probabilistic graphical model. This approach involves learning latent, discrete templates jointly with learning to generate, which makes generation more interpretable and controllable. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is focused on NLP and related areas. \n\nThe paper also involves training neural models, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML). Therefore, the second most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is focused on ML algorithms and applications. \n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to text generation using a probabilistic graphical model, which involves learning latent variables. Therefore, the third most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which is focused on AI algorithms and applications. \n\nThe paper also involves training neural models using backpropagation, which falls under the category of neural networks (NN). Therefore, the fourth most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which is focused on NN algorithms and applications. \n\nFinally, the paper involves developing a new approach to text generation that involves learning templates, which is related to the area of structured prediction."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
