The paper proposes a method for generating robust policies by adding constraints to avoid unsafe states, which involves machine learning techniques such as support estimation and switching policies, suggesting a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with enforcing constraints during execution, which involves control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a simulated pushing task and a physical line tracking task, suggesting a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) for perception and tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
