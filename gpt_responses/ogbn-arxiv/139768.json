It also deals with the allocation of computation devices to multiple users, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper proposes a new algorithm for multi-device, multi-tenant model selection, which involves system-level design and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed algorithm on two applications of automatic model selection, which involves software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
