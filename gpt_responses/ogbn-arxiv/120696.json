Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses observational equivalence in lambda-calculus, which is related to programming language semantics, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions lambda-K\u00f6nig models, which are related to computability theory, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the construction of relational graph models, which is related to graph theory, making cs.TL (Computational Topology) and cs.LT (Learning Theory) possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
