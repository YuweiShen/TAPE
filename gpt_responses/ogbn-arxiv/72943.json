The paper also proposes a learning procedure based on optimal control and adjoint sensitivity analysis, which suggests a connection to control theory and optimization. The proposed regularizers are also relevant to optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also evaluates the proposed model on non-linear classification and function approximation tasks, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
