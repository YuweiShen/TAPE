The paper also discusses the use of alias analysis for change analysis and frame inference, which are topics related to software engineering (cs.SE) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the potential applications of alias analysis to concurrent programming, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.CR) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
