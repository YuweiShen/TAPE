The upper bounds on the Frame Error Rate (FER) are derived by assuming a binary symmetric channel for uplink communications. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper studies the uplink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture and proposes a coding strategy to improve the performance of the network. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with the problem of straggling decoders in a cloud computing platform, which is a common issue in distributed computing. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a coding strategy to improve the performance of a cloud computing system, which can be seen as a control problem. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper deals with the problem of straggling decoders in a cloud computing platform, which can be seen as a computational complexity problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
