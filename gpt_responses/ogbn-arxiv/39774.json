Moreover, the paper discusses equivalence of categories, which is a central concept in category theory. \n- cs.CT (Category Theory): The paper introduces graded extensions of algebraic theories and Lawvere theories, which are based on category theory. The paper also discusses equivalence of categories, which is a central concept in category theory. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses graded monads, which are a computational effect used in programming languages. The paper also gives an example of combining computational effects using sums and tensor products of graded algebraic theories. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses graded monads, which are used in artificial intelligence for modeling uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses graded monads, which are used in data structures and algorithms for modeling computational effects such as state and non-determinism."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
