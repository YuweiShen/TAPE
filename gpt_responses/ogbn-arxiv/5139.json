The paper also discusses the use of neural architecture search (NAS) to design the SpineNet backbone, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of cross-scale connections, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of SpineNet on a fine-grained classification task, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
