The paper also investigates the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to various graph parameters, such as vertex cover number, tree-depth, and cyclomatic number, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM), data structures (cs.DS), and graph theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the problem of finding a 1-planar drawing is a variant of the planar graph drawing problem, which is a well-studied topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
