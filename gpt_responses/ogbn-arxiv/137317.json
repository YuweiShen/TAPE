The focus on strategyproofness suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-category of computational social choice (cs.GT), which deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for collective decision making. The use of metric spaces and distance-based probabilities suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), which deals with the efficient representation and manipulation of geometric objects. The use of approximation ratios and linear programming suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.AI) and learning theory (cs.LG), which deal with the design and analysis of algorithms for prediction and decision making. Finally, the use of information theory suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT), which deals with the quantification and transmission of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
