Additionally, the use of collaborative filtering and content-based ranking are common techniques used in IR. \n\nThe paper also discusses the effectiveness of visual features, such as image or object representations learned from convnets, in improving the user engagement rate of the recommendation system. This suggests that Computer Vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category. \n\nThe use of user curation signals to improve the recommendation system's performance suggests that Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) may also be a relevant sub-category. \n\nMachine Learning (cs.LG) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses the use of collaborative filtering and content-based ranking, which are common techniques in ML. \n\nFinally, Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) may also be a relevant sub-category as the paper discusses the use of textual features in the recommendation system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
