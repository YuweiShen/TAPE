Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and speech recognition. The paper also uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for feature extraction and adaptation, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of signer-independent recognition, which involves dealing with variations among signers, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
