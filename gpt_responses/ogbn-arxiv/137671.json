This involves the study of information transmission and processing, which falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the performance of cellular networks employing multiple antenna techniques. This involves the study of network architecture and protocols, which falls under the purview of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper uses a stochastic geometric framework to model distance-dependent intercell interference. This involves the study of multiagent systems, which are systems composed of multiple interacting agents. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper analyzes the coverage and rate using two linear receivers, namely, partial zero-forcing and minimum-mean-square-estimation receivers. This involves the study of systems and control, which deals with the analysis and design of systems that exhibit dynamic behavior. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the performance of spatial multiplexing techniques in cellular networks. This involves the study of multimedia, which deals with the representation, processing, and communication of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
