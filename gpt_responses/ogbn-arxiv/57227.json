The paper also discusses the compositionality of the new trace equivalence, which is a property that is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper mentions the backward compatibility of the new testing equivalence with testing equivalences for restricted classes of processes, which is a topic that is relevant to formal methods and verification (cs.FL, cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
