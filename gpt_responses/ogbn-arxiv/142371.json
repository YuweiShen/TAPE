The focus of the paper is on scalability, which is a common challenge in handling large datasets, making it relevant to the sub-categories of scalable systems (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of graph kernels and Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
