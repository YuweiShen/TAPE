The main algorithmic tool used in the paper is network decompositions, which are a fundamental concept in distributed graph algorithms and fall under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also deals with constructing spanners, approximations of distributed set cover, and neighborhood covers, which are all topics in cs.DS. The paper involves randomized algorithms, which fall under the category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI).
