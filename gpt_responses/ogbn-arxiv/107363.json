This involves the study of signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and effective SINR, which are key concepts in information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also utilizes extreme value theory, which is a statistical method commonly used in machine learning (cs.SI) and applied mathematics (cs.MA). Finally, the paper deals with MIMO-SDMA systems, which are a subfield of multimedia communications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
