It discusses the benefits of this new concept and provides experimental results to support its practicality. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI, which deals with artificial intelligence and its various subfields, including constraint programming. The paper also involves data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO) in its discussion of the implementation of views. Additionally, it touches on programming languages (cs.PL) in its discussion of the alternative concept of domain views. Finally, the paper discusses the practical benefits of the proposed concept, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
