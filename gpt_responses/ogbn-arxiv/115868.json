Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments on image datasets, which suggests that it may be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses adaptation strategies for algorithms, which could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
