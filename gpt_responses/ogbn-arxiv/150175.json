The focus on query complexity and efficient access to player value distributions suggests a connection to algorithms and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The goal of maximizing revenue in auctions falls under the umbrella of mechanism design and economic theory (cs.EC). Finally, the use of quantile queries and value queries suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
