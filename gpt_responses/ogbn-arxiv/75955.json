The proposed solution involves the use of digital signatures and watermarks, which are commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The protocol can also be adapted to existing services such as Twitter and Facebook, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the solution involves the use of cryptographic techniques, which is a common theme in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
