This involves the use of artificial agents that can combine multiple data streams and add context to data suspected as anomalous. This work involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI), as well as computer security (cs.CR) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The algorithm is population-based and involves the use of multiple agents, which could fall under the category of swarm intelligence (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of bespoke experiments by laboratory-based immunologists suggests a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
