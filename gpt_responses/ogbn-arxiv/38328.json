The paper also deals with structured circuits, which are commonly used in machine learning and probabilistic reasoning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the representation of functions, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the complexity of polynomial-size representations, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the representation of propositional theories, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
