This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's focus on statistical tools and early stopping methods suggests a stronger connection to cs.AI and cs.LG, but the interdisciplinary nature of the problem means that it could also be relevant to the other sub-categories listed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
