Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The use of Product Quantization (PQ) and cache-resident lookup tables suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.DB (databases) and cs.DS (data structures). Finally, the use of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) units and algorithmic modifications to achieve faster computation may also make the paper relevant to cs.LG (machine learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
