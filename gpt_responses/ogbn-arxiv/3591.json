The use of point-to-point techniques and the one-time pad suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the coding theory (cs.CC) sub-category. The fact that the network is pair-wise independent suggests that the paper may be relevant to the networked information systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the use of protocols for different scenarios suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
