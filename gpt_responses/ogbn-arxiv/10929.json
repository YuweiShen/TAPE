The use of online policies and approximation algorithms suggests a focus on computational aspects, which are also relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. Finally, the analysis of the cost functions and competitive ratios involves concepts from information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
