The method involves using a 2.5D grid map, which requires computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to process the LiDAR data. The paper also mentions the use of a fast semi-dense direct method, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the proposed method is aimed at improving the stability and accuracy of autonomous driving, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
