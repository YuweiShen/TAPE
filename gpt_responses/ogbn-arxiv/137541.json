The paper focuses on developing algorithms specific to two scenarios: one in which the sensors have a precise model of the signal formation process and one in which a signal model is not available. The paper also demonstrates the performance of the proposed algorithms in simulation using a robot sensor network to localize the source of a wireless radio signal. Given the focus on distributed control strategies for mobile robot networks, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper involves developing algorithms for distributed control, stochastic optimization, and information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
