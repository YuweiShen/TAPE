The paper also involves the design of algorithms for combinatorial auctions (cs.DS), which is a classic problem in mechanism design. The use of verification instead of monetary transfers is a form of computational social choice (cs.AI), which is concerned with the intersection of computer science and social choice theory. The paper also involves the study of approximation algorithms (cs.EC) and the analysis of their performance guarantees (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
