Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for learning transferable sentence embeddings, which suggests that it could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data mining techniques for discovering relevant discourse markers, which could place it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of these embeddings for transfer tasks, which could place it under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper discusses the use of massive amounts of data, which could place it under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
