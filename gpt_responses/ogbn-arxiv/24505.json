This work involves the design and implementation of a specialized hardware accelerator for RNNs, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR) and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of DWM, a type of non-volatile memory, is a novel approach to RNN acceleration, which could also be relevant to emerging technologies (cs.ET) and systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the energy efficiency of the accelerator, which could be relevant to energy management (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
