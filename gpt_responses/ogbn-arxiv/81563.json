The proposed controller is based on Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian, which is a common control technique used in control systems and robotics (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM), which is a concept used in robotics and control theory (cs.AI). The simulation results are analyzed and verified using MATLAB, which is a programming language commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
