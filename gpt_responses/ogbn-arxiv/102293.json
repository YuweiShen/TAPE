Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a distributed link scheduling algorithm that adapts to network conditions, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The algorithm's performance is evaluated using simulations, which could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
