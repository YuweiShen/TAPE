The authors propose a new method to improve the accuracy of one-stage object detectors, which involves introducing a feature combining module and unifying multi-scale representations (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the weaknesses of one-stage detectors and compares their method to other state-of-the-art detectors, which are common themes in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the proposed method has potential applications in robotics (cs.RO) for object detection and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
