The paper also proposes a novel transmission scheme that involves a common message, which is related to the field of Network Information Theory (cs.NI). The use of statistical knowledge of the estimation error is related to the field of Signal Processing (cs.SI). The paper also uses Alternating Optimization (AO) to solve the problem, which is a common optimization technique in the field of Machine Learning (cs.MM). Finally, the problem of max-min fairness is a well-studied problem in the field of Game Theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
