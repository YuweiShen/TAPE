The use of 1-bit quantization is a specific technique that falls under the Signal Processing (cs.SY) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the optimization of the system parameters to maximize a figure-of-merit involves machine learning and optimization techniques, which are also relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
