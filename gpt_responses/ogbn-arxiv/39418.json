The use of device-to-device (D2D) communications also falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also proposes a graph theory approach to solve the optimization problem, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the simulations involve multimedia applications (cs.MM) such as video streaming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
