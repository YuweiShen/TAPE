Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with structured data sources and knowledge graphs, which suggests the sub-category cs.DB (Databases). The use of neural networks implies the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the task of question answering involves information retrieval, which falls under the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
