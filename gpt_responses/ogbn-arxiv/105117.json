It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it involves training a model to perform a task. Additionally, it could be categorized under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as SNNs are a type of AI model. The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which could place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper includes experimental results on image classification, which could place it in the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
