The paper proposes a hierarchical option-critic architecture that can learn internal policies, termination conditions, and hierarchical compositions over options without the need for any intrinsic rewards or subgoals. This work is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves learning and planning in reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and has applications in robotics, control systems, and computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
