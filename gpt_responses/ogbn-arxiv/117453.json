This involves reformulating 2D instrument pose estimation as heatmap regression, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The method also involves tracking the motion of surgical tools, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The use of deep learning for segmentation and localization tasks is a common theme in multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
