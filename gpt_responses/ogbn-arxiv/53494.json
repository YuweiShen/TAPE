Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses training methods and transfer learning, which are related to machine learning and data mining, respectively. Therefore, cs.SD (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories. Additionally, the paper uses exponential moving average methods, which are commonly used in optimization algorithms, suggesting cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses real-time streaming speech recognition, which could be related to cs.SD (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
