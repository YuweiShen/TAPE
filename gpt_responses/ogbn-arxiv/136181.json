The paper focuses on studying the effect of different masking schemes on the performance and generalisation properties of the network. This is a topic that is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the paper is primarily concerned with machine learning and neural networks, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
