The paper discusses the key features of the architecture, including support for heterogeneous data types, accommodation of new types as they emerge, aggregation of mixed, possibly distributed, data into complex objects, the ability to specify multiple content disseminations of these objects, and the ability to associate rights management schemes with these disseminations. Given these features, the paper is likely to be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DB (Databases), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
