The use of statistical query model (SQ) also suggests a connection to theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper also mentions a standard cryptographic assumption, which further supports the connection to cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the mention of efficient algorithms and computational hardness suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
