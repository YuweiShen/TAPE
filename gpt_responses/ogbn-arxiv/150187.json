The paper also focuses on machine learning approaches, which are covered in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of ptychographic image reconstruction pipelines and distributed deep learning applications suggests that the paper may also fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category.
