The use of deep reinforcement learning and neural networks also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The potential space applications mentioned in the abstract suggest a focus on systems and control (cs.SY), as well as computer vision (cs.CV) for navigating and mapping unknown environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
