Additionally, the paper proposes a method for contextualizing the transformations of the query and key layers, which involves leveraging internal representations and avoiding external resources. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
