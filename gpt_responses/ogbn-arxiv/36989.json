Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP and related areas. The paper also discusses machine learning techniques for weakly-supervised learning, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely category. The use of active learning heuristics and human annotators also indicates that the paper may fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DB (Databases), respectively. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on two datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
