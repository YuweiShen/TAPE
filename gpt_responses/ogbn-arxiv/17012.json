The use of machine learning and entropy signals also suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of image processing techniques to extract features from the documents could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed framework through experiments and comparison with existing tools suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
