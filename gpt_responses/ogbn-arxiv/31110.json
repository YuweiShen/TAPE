The paper specifically focuses on underspecified logical forms (ULFs) for Episodic Logic (EL) as a semantic representation for language understanding. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of ULFs for general inferences and accurate recovery, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the creation of a hand-annotated corpus, which involves issues of data management and security (cs.CR) and potentially software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
