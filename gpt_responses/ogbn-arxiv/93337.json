The paper also discusses ensembling and model distillation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a specialized detector (the Supervised Labeler), which involves training a model on a subset of labeled data, which falls under the category of supervised learning (cs.AI). The paper also mentions two popular vehicular datasets, which suggests that the paper may fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) or robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
