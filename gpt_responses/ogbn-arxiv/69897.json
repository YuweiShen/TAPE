The paper presents a result on the complexity of a restricted version of this problem, called Flat Clustered Planarity, and its equivalence to Independent Flat Clustered Planarity. These topics are closely related to computational geometry (cs.CG), data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), graph theory (cs.GT), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
