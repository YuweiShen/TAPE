The use of deep learning techniques such as residual connections and multi-scale predictions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on medical imaging and brain tumors may also make the paper relevant to neural engineering (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
