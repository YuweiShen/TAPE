Specifically, it focuses on gradient sparsification, which is a technique for reducing communication overhead in federated learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses fairness-aware gradient sparsification, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
