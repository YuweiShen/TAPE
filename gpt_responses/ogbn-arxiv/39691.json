The use of rank/select dictionaries and wavelet trees to mark code-word boundaries suggests that the paper may belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The discussion of entropy and compression ratios suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The mention of security features suggests that the paper may belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of codes and decoding suggests that the paper may also belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the use of experiments and practical advantages suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
