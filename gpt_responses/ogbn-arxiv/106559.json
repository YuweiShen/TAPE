This falls under the domain of information theory, making cs.IT the most likely category.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper extensively uses deep neural networks for various functions, including encoding, decoding, modulation, and demodulation. This makes cs.NE a likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques, specifically deep neural networks, for wireless communication systems. This makes cs.LG a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new method for building data-driven DNNs for end-to-end communication systems. This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY a likely category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless communication systems, which can be considered a form of multimedia communication. This makes cs.MM a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
