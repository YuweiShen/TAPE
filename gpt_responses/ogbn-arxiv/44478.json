The analysis also involves measuring latency and network usage, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the classification of protocols as permissioned or permissionless, which relates to system and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
