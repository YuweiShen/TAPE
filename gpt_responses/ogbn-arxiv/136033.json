This involves learning a policy to dynamically attend to each view based on its importance in the decision-making process. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method with an attention mechanism, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves developing an AI agent that can learn complicated policies in multi-view environments.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's proposed method can be applied to robotics, as it involves learning policies for decision-making in complex environments.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper's proposed method involves leveraging multiple views of the environment, which suggests that computer vision techniques may be used.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's proposed method involves learning policies for decision-making in complex environments, which falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
