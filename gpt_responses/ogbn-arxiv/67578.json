The paper proposes a method to extract rules for explaining the decisions made by the OneClass SVM algorithm. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data mining (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper deals with security and privacy (cs.CR) since anomaly detection is often used in these fields. Finally, the paper also contributes to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.SI) by making machine learning models more interpretable and explainable."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
