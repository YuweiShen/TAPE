The paper also emphasizes the importance of considering the entire SoC for optimization, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the design of customized hardware for neural networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents a case study in the domain of continuous computer vision, which further supports the likelihood of cs.CV being a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
