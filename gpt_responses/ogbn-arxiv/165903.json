The paper also mentions the use of vision in surgical procedures, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method involves the use of constraints and optimization, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using simulations, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
