The robots are also vibration-driven, which is a characteristic of Robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of theoretical techniques from the study of far-from-equilibrium collectives and statistical mechanics, which are topics that fall under the categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Scientific Computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents real robot experiments and simulations, which are topics that fall under the category of Computer Engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
