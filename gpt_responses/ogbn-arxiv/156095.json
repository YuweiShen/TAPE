Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also addresses challenges related to the correlation between answers and textual explanations, which involves machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hence, cs.AI and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using a dataset, which involves information retrieval (IR) techniques. Therefore, cs.IR is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
