The proposed approach is tested in simulated and real experiments with a UR10 robot. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also introduces a novel kernel, which is based on the recently introduced Multiplicative Polynomial Kernel and is designed to capture the polynomial structure of the inverse dynamics. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper includes experiments with a UR10 robot, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision), although this is less likely given the focus on inverse dynamics estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
