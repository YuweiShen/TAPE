The paper also discusses the use of big-graph analytics, which is a subfield of data management and information retrieval (cs.DB). The focus on social networks and spam detection suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI) and the subfield of cyber security (cs.CY). Finally, the paper's emphasis on counting triangles in graphs suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
