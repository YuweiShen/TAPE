This falls under the scope of information retrieval.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a language model based on sub-lexical units, called multigrams, which is a technique used in natural language processing. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of language unification on the recognition system, which is also relevant to the field of computational linguistics.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with handwriting recognition, which is a subfield of computer vision. The authors discuss the use of a single optical model for recognizing handwriting across multiple languages.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the design and training of a multilingual handwriting recognition system, which is a machine learning task. The authors propose a language model based on multigrams, which is a technique used in machine learning for text processing.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the development of a unified multilingual handwriting recognition system, which is an application of artificial intelligence. The authors propose a language model based on sub-lexical units, which is a technique used in natural language processing and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
