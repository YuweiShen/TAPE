This falls under the category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of similarity among partners, which can be related to the field of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The approaches developed involve transferring information from partners with sufficient data to those without any campaign data, which can be related to the field of Data Science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves analyzing and processing natural language data, which can be related to the field of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
