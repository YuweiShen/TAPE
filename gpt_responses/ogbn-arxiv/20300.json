The interference is symmetric and the problem is motivated by topological interference management in wireless communication networks, which suggests a possible fit in the networked systems (cs.NI) or signal processing (cs.SI) categories. The paper also discusses vector linear index codes, which could fall under coding theory (cs.CC) or multimedia (cs.MM) depending on the context."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
