Additionally, it discusses the potential for exploiting multi-core hardware, which could fall under the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper also mentions the potential for enabling flexible transactions in cloud database deployments, which could fall under the cs.OS (Operating Systems) and cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing) sub-categories.
