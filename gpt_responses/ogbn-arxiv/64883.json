This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of historical data and the extraction of common patterns, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Economics (cs.CE) sub-categories.
