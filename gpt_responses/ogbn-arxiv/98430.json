The paper focuses on outage probabilities and respective sum rates, which are key concepts in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communication networks, which is a topic related to networking and internet architecture. The paper also focuses on optimizing the hovering altitude of UAV-BS to serve more users at their requested target rates. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of multi-antenna techniques to generate directional beams specifically taking into consideration the physical constraints of the antenna array. This is a topic related to systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmission, which is a topic related to multimedia. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not focus on cryptography and security, but it does discuss the importance of identifying a proper user pair for maximizing sum rates with NOMA transmission, which is a topic related to security in wireless communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
