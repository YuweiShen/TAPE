This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The use of an Inception-like architecture for the autoencoder suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.NE) and the use of product quantization for approximate distance computation suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach for anomaly detection, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
