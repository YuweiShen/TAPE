This is a key area of research in robotics, making cs.RO a likely sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a probabilistic extension of a formal language for specification of (non)-functional requirements in automotive systems. This is a key area of research in software engineering, making cs.SE a likely sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the formal verification of dynamic and stochastic behaviors in automotive systems, which is a key area of research in systems and control.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes an extension of a formal language for specification of complex requirements related to multiple events. This is a key area of research in programming languages, making cs.PL a likely sub-category.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the correctness of requirements by mapping the semantics of the specifications into UPPAAL models. This is a key area of research in logic in computer science, making cs.LO a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
