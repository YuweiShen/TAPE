The paper also presents a new algorithm for optimizing the multilinear relaxation, which involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of symmetry properties in previous algorithms, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
