This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves interference cancellation and throughput analysis, which could also place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also deals with communication protocols and mechanisms, which could place it in the Communications (cs.COMM) sub-category.
