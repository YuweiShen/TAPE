This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the analysis of different loss functions and their impact on the results, which is related to database systems (cs.DB) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates the ability of both models to embed symmetric and antisymmetric patterns, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
