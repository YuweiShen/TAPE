The use of entropy and coding techniques suggests a possible connection to statistical learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) as well. Finally, the paper introduces a new upper bound on the capacity region, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
