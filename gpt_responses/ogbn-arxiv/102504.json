This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper models the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
