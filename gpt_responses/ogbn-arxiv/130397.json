The classes of functions considered in the paper, such as $k$-junta, $k$-linear functions, decision list, and branching programs, are also commonly studied in the context of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and spectral graph theory (cs.SC) to analyze the properties of the functions and the performance of the testers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
