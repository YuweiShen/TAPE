This involves extracting pertinent features for different data contexts, representing each entity with latent interaction vector and latent independence vector, and learning a non-linear function of them via a neural network. These concepts are closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
