Additionally, it involves the use of generative deep models, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) as it generates images from textual descriptions of ingredients. Therefore, it could also belong to the NLP (cs.CL) sub-category. \n\nThe use of generative neural networks (GANs) and attention-based models suggests that the paper could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the synthesis of complex images, which could require knowledge of graphics and visualization techniques.
