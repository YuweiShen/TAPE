Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The method involves regression of multiple points on the edge of text line, which can be seen as a machine learning task, suggesting that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the reduction of system parameters and the generation of more regular polygons, which are topics related to machine learning and optimization, indicating that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category. The paper uses region proposal network (RPN) and can be adapted to object detection architectures such as Faster R-CNN and R-FCN, which are common techniques in information retrieval and computer vision, suggesting that cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with text detection in natural scenes, which is a topic related to natural language processing and computer vision, indicating that cs.CL (Computation and Language) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
