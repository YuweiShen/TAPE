The paper also introduces novel components that adaptively fuse features over time and dynamically allocate computation based on accuracy prediction, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the proposed framework is also relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
