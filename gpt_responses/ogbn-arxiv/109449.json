However, the authors propose a new approach that exploits the low-dimensional structure of the data, which involves algebraic techniques (cs.NA) and optimization algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed approach through simulations, which involves statistical analysis (cs.SI) and machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
