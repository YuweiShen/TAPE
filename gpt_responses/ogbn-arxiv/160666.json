The paper discusses different formulations of the problem as integer linear programs and pseudo-boolean satisfiability problems. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) or Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the practical performance of the proposed algorithms, which could indicate that it belongs to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Machine Learning (cs.LG), or Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
