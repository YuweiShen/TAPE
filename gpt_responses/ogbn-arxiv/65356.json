It examines the inferential potential of biosensed data and creates a taxonomy of signals that may be collected remotely or via casual contact. The paper also explores how social norms evolved in response to remote collection in public, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Cybersecurity (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of photography cases to illustrate the evolution of social norms suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper's focus on the collection and interpretation of physiological signals suggests that it may also belong to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
