The paper also discusses the optimization of transmission schemes, which is a topic relevant to control and optimization (cs.SI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper deals with the performance of a multicast network, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
